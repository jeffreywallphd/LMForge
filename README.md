# LMForge Setup Steps:

1. First, ensure you have requisite programs installed. You will need 

* Python (most of features have been tested on versions 3.10 and 3.11).
* MySQL 

2. Next, create a Python environment using the following command in the terminal (you should be located in the outer lmforge folder):

* For Windows:
- To create a virtual environment : python -m venv venv
- To activate virtual environment : .\venv\Scripts\activate

* For Linux / macOS:
- To create a virtual environment : python3 -m venv venv
- To activate virtual environment : source venv/bin/activate

3. Then, install dependencies. Most dependencies can be installed using the command below. However, torch with CUDA support must be configured according to your environment.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Visit the following site to retrieve the appropriate pip install for torch: https://pytorch.org/

4. Next, create .env file in the outer lmforge folder which should contain the following information:
    DATABASE_NAME=mydatabase 
    DATABASE_USER=myuser
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=mypassword
    DATABASE_HOST=localhost
    DATABASE_PORT=3306
    WANDB_API_KEY=yourKey
    HF_API_KEY=yourKey
    OPENAI_API_KEY=yourKey
- Be sure to change the values above to values for your system. 

5. Last, make sure your file location in your terminal is in the outer lmforge folder. Start your Python virtual environment with the first command below. Then, run the next three Python commands.
- .\venv\Scripts\activate
- python manage.py makemigrations
- python manage.py migrate
- python manage.py runserver

6. Whenever you want to start the applicatoin again, start your Python virtual environment and run the Python command below.
- .\venv\Scripts\activate
- python manage.py runserver
