## Introduction
This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding, configuring, and using _LMForge_. It is organized by teams, so you can easily locate information relevant to specific areas of the project.
* **Team-Based Organization**: Each team has their own dedicated folder, allowing for easy navigation of content on a per team basis.
* **Consistency**: Documentation across the project should start to follow a standardized template to ensure uniformity and coherence. (This may vary as we establish and enact these ideas)
## How to Use This Documentation
### **1. Navigating Folders**
The documentation depository is organized into year-level directories for a multi-year approach to documentation on _LMForge_.
* `documentation/`: Core documentation applicable across all features/teams.
* `documentation/[Active Class Year]/`: Current and archived team folders.
### **2. Readme Files in Each Subfolder**
Each subfolder should contain a `README.md` file that serves as an introduction to that specific section, feature, or team. These files typically include:
* An overview of the feature or topic.
* Links to detailed documentation fiels for deeper understanding (think articles or any text that may have been instrumental in informing your team about the subject).
* A table of contents to guide you through the available documentation in that area.
Refer to these README fiels to get started quickly and navigate the content efficiently.
## Maintaining Documentation
### Process for Updating Documentation
As the project evolves, it is essential to keep the documentation accurate and up to date. Follow these best practices to maintain the quality and relevance of the documentation:
### **1. Identify the Need for Updates**
* **Regular Review**: Periodically review the existing documentation to identify outdated information, missing content, or new features.
* **Feedback**: Collect feedback from team members, users, and stakeholders on areas that may require clarification or expansion.
* **Track Project Changes**: Monitor release notes, commits, and other project updates to ensure documentation aligns with the latest changes.
### **2. Create a Local Copy**
* Clone the latest version of the documentation repository to your local machine.
* Create a new branch for your changes, following the version control guidelines and naming conventions.
### **3. Make Necessary Edits**
* Navigate to the relevant section or feature folder.
* Edit the content to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency.
* Update code examples, images, and references as needed.
### **4. Update Related Sections**
If the changes impact other areas (e.g., configuration changes, API updates), ensure those sections are updated as well.
### **5. Preview Your Changes**
* Preview your changes locally to verify proper formatting and readability.
* Check for broken links or missing references using the `Preview` button or tools like [Markdown Link Checker](https://markdownlivepreview.com/)
### **6. Submit for Review**
Once changes are made, submit a pull request (PR) following the project’s contribution guidelines.
## Best Practices for Writing Documentation
### **1. Clarity and Conciseness**
* Aim for clear, easy-to-understand language.
* Avoid jargon unless it is well-defined within the context of the project.
* Be concise--users should be able to quickly grapsh the necessary information.
### **2. Consistent Formatting**
* Use headings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break content into digestible chunks.
* Keep code examples consistent in style, indentation, and formatting.
* Use hyperlinks to connect related topics or external resources.
### **3. Regular Updates**
* Documentation should be updated with every change in the project.
* Review the documentation regularly to ensure it reflects the current state of the project.
## Additional Resources Used
### **For Project Management:**
* [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/)
ClickUp was the project management tool we selected in Fall 2025. It's features include dashboards, user stories, sprint features, etc. We use it to organize our development efforts, track progress against goals, and manage the technical complexity of this AI project.
### **For Planning:**
* We use Google Docs to track written goals and unstructured ideas that don't fit neatly into ClickUp tasks.
