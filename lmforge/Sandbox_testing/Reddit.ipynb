Is there a way to get an actual map view or normal navigation or is there a way to disable OnStar and install Chevrolet mylink or something. When I start the truck the screen says \"MyLink\" then the screen shows icons for OnStar, Pandora, settings and navigation. If I hit the navigation button it just tells me to press the blue OnStar button to get directions sent to the truck screen which then just shows turn by turn instructions.
