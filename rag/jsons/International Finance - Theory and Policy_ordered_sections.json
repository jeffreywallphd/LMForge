      "content": "Traditionally, intermediate-level international economics texts seem to fall into one of two categories. Some are\nwritten for students who may one day continue on in an economics PhD program. These texts develop advanced\ngeneral equilibrium models and use sophisticated mathematics. However, these texts are also very difficult for the\naverage, non-PhD-bound student to understand. Other intermediate texts are written for noneconomics majors who\nmay take only a few economics courses in their program. These texts present descriptive information about the world\nand only the bare basics about how economic models are used to describe that world.\nThis text strives to reach a median between these two approaches. First, I believe that students need to learn the\ntheory and models to understand how economists understand the world. I also think these ideas are accessible to\nmost students if they are explained thoroughly. This text presents numerous models in some detail, not by employing\nadvanced mathematics, but rather by walking students through a detailed description of how a model’s assumptions\ninfluence its conclusions. Second, and perhaps more important, students must learn how the models connect with the\nreal world. I believe that theory is done primarily to guide policy. We do positive economics to help answer the\nnormative questions; for example, what should a country do about its trade policy or its exchange rate policy? The\nresults from models give us insights that help us answer these questions. Thus this text strives to explain why each\nmodel is interesting by connecting its results to some aspect of a current policy issue. A prime example is found\nin Chapter 13 \"Fixed versus Floating Exchange Rates\" of this book, which addresses the age-old question of whether\ncountries use fixed or floating exchange rates. The chapter applies the theories developed throughout the text to assist\nour understanding of this long-standing debate.\n2",

      "content": "Past History, and International Institutions\nEconomics is a social science whose purpose is to understand the workings of the real-world economy. An economy is\nsomething that no one person can observe in its entirety. We are all a part of the economy, we all buy and sell things\ndaily, but we cannot observe all parts and aspects of an economy at any one time.\nFor this reason, economists build mathematical models, or theories, meant to describe different aspects of the real\nworld. For some students, economics seems to be all about these models and theories, these abstract equations and\ndiagrams. However, in actuality, economics is about the real world, the world we all live in.\nFor this reason, it is important in any economics course to describe the conditions in the real world before diving into\nthe theory intended to explain them. In this case, in a textbook about international finance, it is very useful for a\nstudent to know some of the values of important macroeconomic variables, the trends in these variables over time,\nand the policy issues and controversies surrounding them.\nThis first chapter provides an overview of the real world with respect to international finance. It explains not only how\nthings look now but also where we have been and why things changed along the way. It describes current economic\nconditions and past trends with respect to the most critical international macroeconomic indicators. In particular, it\ncompares the most recent worldwide economic recession with past business cycle activity to put our current situation\ninto perspective. The chapter also discusses important institutions and explains why they have been created.\nWith this overview about international finance in the real world in mind, a student can better understand why the\ntheories and models in the later chapters are being developed. This chapter lays the groundwork for everything else\nthat follows.\n3",

          "content": "International economics is growing in importance as a field of study because of the rapid integration of\ninternational economic markets. Increasingly, businesses, consumers, and governments realize that their\nlives are affected not only by what goes on in their own town, state, or country but also by what is\nhappening around the world. Consumers can walk into their local shops today and buy goods and services\nfrom all over the world. Local businesses must compete with these foreign products. However, many of\nthese same businesses also have new opportunities to expand their markets by selling to a multitude of\nconsumers in other countries. The advance of telecommunications is also rapidly reducing the cost of\nproviding services internationally, while the Internet will assuredly change the nature of many products\nand services as it expands markets even further.\nOne simple way to see the rising importance of international economics is to look at the growth of exports\nin the world during the past fifty or more years. Figure 1.1 \"World Exports, 1948–2008 (in Billions of U.S.\nDollars)\" shows the overall annual exports measured in billions of U.S. dollars from 1948 to 2008.\nFIGURE 1.1 WORLD EXPORTS, 1948–2008 (IN BILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS)\nSource: World Trade Organization, International trade and tariff\ndata,http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/statis_e.htm.\n\nRecognizing that one country’s exports are another country’s imports, one can see the exponential growth\nin outflows and inflows during the past fifty years.\nHowever, rapid growth in the value of exports does not necessarily indicate that trade is becoming more\nimportant. A better method is to look at the share of traded goods in relation to the size of the world\neconomy. Figure 1.2 \"World Exports, 1970–2008 (Percentage of World GDP)\" shows world exports as a\npercentage of the world gross domestic product (GDP) for the years 1970 to 2008. It shows a steady\nincrease in trade as a share of the size of the world economy. World exports grew from just over 10\npercent of the GDP in 1970 to over 30 percent by 2008. Thus trade is not only rising rapidly in absolute\nterms; it is becoming relatively more important too.\nFigure 1.2 World Exports, 1970–2008 (Percentage of World GDP)\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook Database,\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/index.aspx.\nOne other indicator of world interconnectedness can be seen in changes in the amount of foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI). FDI is foreign ownership of productive activities and thus is another way in which\nforeign economic influence can affect a country.Figure 1.3 \"World Inward FDI Stocks, 1980–2007\n(Percentage of World GDP)\" shows the stock, or the sum total value, of FDI around the world taken as a\npercentage of the world GDP between 1980 and 2007. It gives an indication of the importance of foreign\nownership and influence around the world. As can be seen, the share of FDI has grown dramatically from\naround 5 percent of the world GDP in 1980 to over 25 percent of the GDP just twenty-five years later.\n\n.\nThe growth of international trade and investment has been stimulated partly by the steady decline of\ntrade barriers since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the post–World War II era,\nFigure 1.3 World Inward FDI Stocks, 1980–2007 (Percentage of World GDP)\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook\nDatabase,http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/index.aspx;\nUNCTAD, FDI Statistics: Division on Investment and\nEnterprise,http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=4979&lang=1\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, prompted regular negotiations among a growing\nbody of members to reciprocally reduce tariffs (import taxes) on imported goods. During each of these\nregular negotiations (eight of these rounds were completed between 1948 and 1994), countries promised\nto reduce their tariffs on imports in exchange for concessions—that means tariff reductions—by other\nGATT members. When the Uruguay Round, the most recently completed round, was finalized in 1994, the\nmember countries succeeded in extending the agreement to include liberalization promises in a much\nlarger sphere of influence. Now countries not only would lower tariffs on goods trade but also would begin\nto liberalize the agriculture and services markets. They would eliminate the many quota systems—like the\nmultifiber agreement in clothing—that had sprouted up in previous decades. And they would agree to\nadhere to certain minimum standards to protect intellectual property rights such as patents, trademarks,\nand copyrights. TheWorld Trade Organization (WTO) was created to manage this system of new\nagreements, to provide a forum for regular discussion of trade matters, and to implement a well-defined\nprocess for settling trade disputes that might arise among countries.\n\nAs of 2009, 153 countries were members of the WTO “trade liberalization club,” and many more countries\nwere still negotiating entry. As the club grows to include more members—and if the latest round of trade\nliberalization talks, called the Doha Round, concludes with an agreement—world markets will become\nincreasingly open to trade and investment. [1]\nAnother international push for trade liberalization has come in the form of regional free trade\nagreements. Over two hundred regional trade agreements around the world have been notified, or\nannounced, to the WTO. Many countries have negotiated these agreements with neighboring countries or\nmajor trading partners to promote even faster trade liberalization. In part, these have arisen because of\nthe slow, plodding pace of liberalization under the GATT/WTO. In part, the regional trade agreements\nhave occurred because countries have wished to promote interdependence and connectedness with\nimportant economic or strategic trade partners. In any case, the phenomenon serves to open international\nmarkets even further than achieved in the WTO.\nThese changes in economic patterns and the trend toward ever-increasing openness are an important\naspect of the more exhaustive phenomenon known as globalization. Globalization more formally refers to\nthe economic, social, cultural, or environmental changes that tend to interconnect peoples around the\nworld. Since the economic aspects of globalization are certainly the most pervasive of these changes, it is\nincreasingly important to understand the implications of a global marketplace on consumers, businesses,\nand governments. That is where the study of international economics begins.\nWhat Is International Economics?\nInternational economics is a field of study that assesses the implications of international trade,\ninternational investment, and international borrowing and lending. There are two broad subfields within\nthe discipline: international trade and international finance.\nInternational trade is a field in economics that applies microeconomic models to help understand the\ninternational economy. Its content includes basic supply-and-demand analysis of international markets;\nfirm and consumer behavior; perfectly competitive, oligopolistic, and monopolistic market structures; and\nthe effects of market distortions. The typical course describes economic relationships among consumers,\nfirms, factory owners, and the government.\nThe objective of an international trade course is to understand the effects of international trade on\nindividuals and businesses and the effects of changes in trade policies and other economic conditions. The\n\ncourse develops arguments that support a free trade policy as well as arguments that support various\ntypes of protectionist policies. By the end of the course, students should better understand the centuries-\nold controversy between free trade and protectionism.\nInternational finance applies macroeconomic models to help understand the international economy. Its\nfocus is on the interrelationships among aggregate economic variables such as GDP, unemployment rates,\ninflation rates, trade balances, exchange rates, interest rates, and so on. This field expands basic\nmacroeconomics to include international exchanges. Its focus is on the significance of trade imbalances,\nthe determinants of exchange rates, and the aggregate effects of government monetary and fiscal policies.\nThe pros and cons of fixed versus floating exchange rate systems are among the important issues\naddressed.\nThis international trade textbook begins in this chapter by discussing current and past issues and\ncontroversies relating to microeconomic trends and policies. We will highlight past trends both in\nimplementing policies that restrict trade and in forging agreements to reduce trade barriers. It is these\nreal-world issues that make the theory of international trade worth studying.",

          "content": "Balances\n\ncountries, including GDP, GDP per capita, unemployment rates, inflation rates, national budget\nbalances, and national debts.\nWhen someone reads the business and economics news it is common to see numerous values and figures\nused to describe the economic situation somewhere. For example, if you read a story about the Philippines\nyou might read that the gross domestic product (GDP) is $167 billion or that the GDP per person is\n$3,500 per person, or that its unemployment rate is 7.1 percent and its inflation rate is now 2.8 percent.\nYou might read that it has a government budget deficit of 3.7 percent of the GDP and a trade deficit of 5.2\npercent of the GDP. But what does this all mean? How is someone supposed to interpret and understand\nwhether the numbers indicate something good, bad, or neutral about the country?\nOne way to make judgments is to compare these numbers with other countries. To this end, the next few\nsections will present some recent data for a selected set of countries. Although memorizing these numbers\nis not so important, especially since they will all soon change, it is helpful to have an idea about what the\nvalues are for a few countries; or if not that, to know the approximate normal average for a particular\nvariable. Thus it is useful to know that GDP per person ranges from about $500 per year at the low end to\nabout $50,000 to $75,000 per person at the high end. It is also useful to know that unemployment rates\nare normally less than 10 percent. So when you read that Zimbabwe recently had unemployment of 75\npercent, a reader will know how unusually large that is. Once you also recognize that inflation rates are\nnormally less than 10 percent, a rate of 10,000 percent will strike you as extraordinary.\nThus the values for some of these numbers will be helpful to make comparisons across countries today\nand to make comparisons over time for a particular country. Therefore, it can be very helpful to know the\nnumbers for at least a few countries, or what may be deemed a set of reference countries. The countries\nin Table 1.1 \"GDP and GDP per Capita (PPP in Billions of Dollars), 2009\" were selected to provide a cross\nsection of countries at different levels of economic development. Thus the United States, the European\nUnion, and Japan represent the largest economies in the world today. Meanwhile, countries like Brazil,\nRussia, India, and China are watched so closely today that they have acquired their own acronym: the\n\nBRIC countries. Finally, countries like Indonesia, Kenya, Ghana, and Burundi are among the poorest\nnations of the world. Note that in later tables other countries were substituted for the African countries\nbecause data are less difficult to obtain.\nGross Domestic Product around the World\nMacroeconomics is the study of the interrelationships of aggregate economic variables. The most\nimportant of these, without question, is a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). GDP measures the\ntotal value of all goods and services produced by a country during a year. As such, it is a measure of the\nextent of economic activity in a country or the economic size of a country.\nAnd because the consumption of goods and services is one way to measure an individual’s economic well-\nbeing, it is easy to calculate the GDP per capita (i.e., per person) to indicate the average well-being of\nindividuals in a country.\nDetails about how to measure and interpret GDP follow in subsequent chapters, but before doing so, it\nmakes some sense to know a little about how economy size and GDP per person vary across countries\naround the world. Which are the biggest countries, and which are the smallest? Which countries provide\nmore goods and services, on average, and which produce less? And how wide are the differences between\ncountries? Table 1.1 \"GDP and GDP per Capita (PPP in Billions of Dollars), 2009\" provides recent\ninformation for a selected group of countries. Note that reported numbers are based on purchasing power\nparity (PPP), which is a better way to make cross-country comparisons and is explained later. A\nconvenient source of the most recent comprehensive data from three sources (the International Monetary\nFund [IMF], the World Bank, and the U.S. CIA) of GDP\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29) and GDP per person\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita) is available at\nWikipedia.\nTable 1.1 GDP and GDP per Capita (PPP in Billions of Dollars), 2009\nCountry/Region (Rank) GDP (Percentage in the World) GDP per Capita (Rank)\nWorld 68,997 (100) 10,433\nEuropean Union (1) 15,247 (22.1) —\n\nCountry/Region (Rank) GDP (Percentage in the World) GDP per Capita (Rank)\nUnited States (2) 14,265 (20.7) 47,440 (6)\nChina (3) 7,916 (11.5) 5,970 (100)\nJapan (4) 4,354 (6.3) 34,116 (24)\nIndia (5) 3,288 (4.8) 2,780 (130)\nRussia (7) 2,260 (3.3) 15,948 (52)\nBrazil (10) 1,981 (2.9) 10,466 (77)\nSouth Korea (14) 1,342 (1.9) 27,692 (33)\nIndonesia (17) 908 (1.3) 3,980 (121)\nKenya (82) 60 (nil) 1,712 (148)\nGhana (96) 34 (nil) 1,518 (152)\nBurundi (158) 3 (nil) 390 (178)\nTable 1.1 \"GDP and GDP per Capita (PPP in Billions of Dollars), 2009\" displays several things that are\nworth knowing. First, note that the United States and European Union each make up about one-fifth of\nthe world economy; together the two are 42 percent. Throw Japan into the mix with the European Union\nand the United States and together they make up less than one-sixth of the world’s population. However,\nthese three developed nations produce almost one-half of the total world production. This is a testament\nto the high productivity in the developed regions of the world. It is also a testament to the low productivity\nin much of the rest of the world, where it takes another five billion people to produce the remaining half of\nthe GDP.\nThe second thing worth recognizing is the wide dispersion of GDPs per capita across countries. The\nUnited States ranks sixth in the world at $47,440 and is surpassed by several small countries like\nSingapore and Luxembourg and/or those with substantial oil and gas resources such as Brunei, Norway,\nand Qatar (not shown in Table 1.1 \"GDP and GDP per Capita (PPP in Billions of Dollars), 2009\"). Average\n\nGDP per capita in the world is just over $10,000, and it is just as remarkable how far above the average\nsome countries like the United States, Japan, and South Korea are as it is how far below the average other\ncountries like China, India, Indonesia, and Kenya are. Perhaps most distressing is the situation of some\ncountries like Burundi that has a GDP of only $370 per person. (Other countries in a similar situation\ninclude Zimbabwe, Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Niger, and Afghanistan.)\nUnemployment and Inflation around the World\nTwo other key macroeconomic variables that are used as an indicator of the health of a national economy\nare the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the\nworking population in a country who would like to be working but are currently unemployed. The lower\nthe rate, the healthier the economy and vice versa. The inflation rate measures the annual rate of increase\nof the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is a ratio that measures how much a set of goods costs this\nperiod relative to the cost of the same set of goods in some initial year. Thus if the CPI registers 107, it\nwould cost $107 (euros or whatever is the national currency) to buy the goods today, while it would have\ncost just $100 to purchase the same goods in the initial period. This represents a 7 percent increase in\naverage prices over the period, and if that period were a year, it would correspond to the annual inflation\nrate. In general, a relatively moderate inflation rate (about 0–4 percent) is deemed acceptable; however, if\ninflation is too high it usually contributes to a less effective functioning of an economy. Also, if inflation is\nnegative, it is called deflation, and that can also contribute to an economic slowdown.\nTable 1.2 Unemployment and Inflation Rates\nCountry/Region Unemployment Rate (%) Inflation Rate (%)\nEuropean Union 9.8 (Oct. 2009) +0.5 (Nov. 2009)\nUnited States 10.0 (Nov. 2009) +1.8 (Nov. 2009)\nChina 9.2 (2008) +0.6 (Nov. 2009)\nJapan 5.1 (Oct. 2009) −2.5 (Oct. 2009)\nIndia 9.1 (2008) +11.5 (Oct. 2009)\nRussia 7.7 (Oct. 2009) +9.1 (Nov. 2009)\n\nCountry/Region Unemployment Rate (%) Inflation Rate (%)\nBrazil 7.5 (Oct. 2009) +4.2 (Nov. 2009)\nSouth Korea 3.5 (Nov. 2009) +2.4 (Nov. 2009)\nIndonesia 8.1 (Feb. 2009) +2.4 (Oct. 2009)\nSpain 19.3 (Oct. 2009) +0.3 (Nov. 2009)\nSouth Africa 24.5 (Sep. 2009) +5.8 (Nov. 2009)\nEstonia 15.2 (Jul. 2009) −2.1 (Nov. 2009)\nSource: Economist, Weekly Indicators, December 17, 2009.\nThe unemployment rates and inflation rates in most countries are unusual in the reported period because\nof the economic crisis that hit the world in 2008. The immediate effect of the crisis was a drop in demand\nfor many goods and services, a contraction in GDP, and the loss of jobs for workers in many industries. In\naddition, prices were either stable or fell in many instances. When most economies of the world were\nbooming several years earlier, a normal unemployment rate would have been 3 to 5 percent, while a\nnormal inflation rate would stand at about 3 to 6 percent.\nAs Table 1.2 \"Unemployment and Inflation Rates\" shows, though, unemployment rates in most countries\nin 2009 are much higher than that, while inflation rates tend to be lower with several exceptions. In the\nUnited States, the unemployment rate has more than doubled, but in the European Union,\nunemployment was at a higher rate than the United States before the crisis hit, and so it has not risen\nquite as much. Several standouts in unemployment are Spain and South Africa. These are exceedingly\nhigh rates coming very close to the United States unemployment rate of 25 percent reached during the\nGreat Depression in 1933.\nIndia’s inflation rate is the highest of the group listed but is not much different from inflation in India the\nyear before of 10.4 percent. Russia’s inflation this year has actually fallen from its rate last year of 13.2\npercent. Japan and Estonia, two countries in the list, are reporting deflation this year. Japan had inflation\nof 1.7 percent in the previous year, whereas Estonia’s rate had been 8 percent.\nGovernment Budget Balances around the World\n\nAnother factor that is often considered in assessing the health of an economy is the state of the country’s\ngovernment budget. Governments collect tax revenue from individuals and businesses and use that\nmoney to finance the purchase of government provided goods and services. Some of the spending is on\npublic goods such as national defense, health care, and police and fire protection. The government also\ntransfers money from those better able to pay to others who are disadvantaged, such as welfare recipients\nor the elderly under social insurance programs.\nGenerally, if government were to collect more in tax revenue than it spent on programs and transfers,\nthen it would be running a government budget surplus and there would be little cause for concern.\nHowever, many governments oftentimes tend to spend and transfer more than they collect in tax revenue.\nIn this case, they run a government budget deficit that needs to be paid for or financed in some manner.\nThere are two ways to cover a budget deficit. First, the government can issue Treasury bills and bonds and\nthus borrow money from the private market; second, the government can sometimes print additional\nmoney. If borrowing occurs, the funds become unavailable to finance private investment or consumption,\nand thus the situation represents a substitution of public spending for private spending. Borrowed funds\nmust also be paid back with accrued interest, which implies that larger future taxes will have to be\ncollected assuming that budget balance or a surplus is eventually achieved.\nWhen governments borrow, they will issue Treasury bonds with varying maturities. Thus some will be\npaid back in one of two years, but others perhaps not for thirty years. In the meantime, the total\noutstanding balance of IOUs (i.e., I owe you) that the government must pay back in the future is called\nthe national debt. This debt is owed to whoever has purchased the Treasury bonds; for many countries, a\nsubstantial amount is purchased by domestic citizens, meaning that the country borrows from itself and\nthus must pay back its own citizens in the future. The national debt is often confused with a nation’s\ninternational indebtedness to the rest of the world, which is known as its international investment\nposition (defined in the next section).\nExcessive borrowing by a government can cause economic difficulties. Sometimes private lenders worry\nthat the government may become insolvent (i.e., unable to repay its debts) in the future. In this case,\ncreditors may demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher perceived risk. To prevent that\nrisk, governments sometimes revert to the printing of money to reduce borrowing needs. However,\nexcessive money expansion is invariably inflationary and can cause long-term damage to the economy.\n\nIn Table 1.3 \"Budget Balance and National Debt (Percentage of GDP), 2009\", we present budget balances\nfor a selected set of countries. Each is shown as a percentage of GDP, which gives a more accurate\nportrayal of the relative size. Although there is no absolute number above which a budget deficit or a\nnational debt is unsustainable, budget deficits greater than 5 percent per year, those that are persistent\nover a long period, or a national debt greater than 50 percent of GDP tends to raise concerns among\ninvestors.\nTable 1.3 Budget Balance and National Debt (Percentage of GDP), 2009\nCountry/Region Budget Balance (%) National Debt (%)\nEuropean Union −6.5 —\nUnited States −11.9 37.5\nChina −3.4 15.6\nJapan −7.7 172.1\nIndia −8.0 56.4\nRussia −8.0 6.5\nBrazil −3.2 38.8\nSouth Korea −4.5 24.4\nIndonesia −2.6 29.3\nSpain −10.8 40.7\nSouth Africa −5.0 31.6\nEstonia −4.0 4.8\nSource: Economist, Weekly Indicators, December 17, 2009, and the CIA World Factbook.\nNote that all the budget balances for this selected set of countries are in deficit. For many countries, the\ndeficits are very large, exceeding 10 percent in the U.S. and Spain. Although deficits for most countries are\ncommon, usually they are below 5 percent of the GDP. The reason for the higher deficits now is because\n\nmost countries have increased their government spending to counteract the economic recession, while at\nthe same time suffering a reduction in tax revenues also because of the recession. Thus budget deficits\nhave ballooned around the world, though to differing degrees.\nAs budget deficits rise and as GDP falls due to the recession, national debts as a percent of GDP are also\non the rise in most countries. In the United States, the national debt is still at a modest 37.5 percent, but\nrecent projections suggest that in a few years it may quickly rise to 60 percent or 70 percent of the GDP.\nNote also that these figures subtract any debt issued by the government and purchased by another branch\nof the government. For example, in the United States for the past decade or more, the Social Security\nsystem has collected more in payroll taxes than it pays out in benefits. The surplus, known as the Social\nSecurity “trust fund,” is good because in the next few decades as the baby boom generation retires, the\nnumbers of Social Security recipients is expected to balloon. But for now the surplus is used to purchase\ngovernment Treasury bonds. In other words, the Social Security administration lends money to the rest of\nthe government. Those loans currently sum to about 30 percent of GDP or somewhat over $4 trillion. If\nwe include these loans as a part of the national debt, the United States debt is now, according to the online\nnational debt clock, more than $12 trillion or about 85 percent of GDP. (This is larger than 37.5 + 30\npercent because the debt clock is an estimate of more recent figures and reflects the extremely large\ngovernment budget deficit run in the previous year.)\nMost other countries’ debts are on a par with that of the U.S. with two notable exceptions. First, China and\nRussia’s debts are fairly modest at only 15.6 percent and 6.5 percent of GDP, respectively. Second, Japan’s\nnational debt is an astounding 172 percent of GDP. It has arisen because the Japanese government has\ntried to extricate its economy from an economic funk by spending and borrowing over the past two\ndecades.",

          "content": "Positions\n\nselected set of countries, including the trade balance, the international investment position, and\nexchange rate systems.\nCountries interact with each other in two important ways: trade and investment. Trade encompasses the\nexport and import of goods and services. Investment involves the borrowing and lending of money and\nthe foreign ownership of property and stock within a country. The most important international\nmacroeconomic variables, then, are the trade balance, which measures the difference between the total\nvalue of exports and the total value of imports, and the exchange rate, which measures the number of\nunits of one currency that exchanges for one unit of another currency.\nExchange Rate Regimes\nBecause countries use different national currencies, international trade and investment requires an\nexchange of currency. To buy something in another country, one must first exchange one’s national\ncurrency for another. Governments must decide not only how to issue its currency but how international\ntransactions will be conducted. For example, under a traditional gold standard, a country sets a price for\ngold (say $20 per ounce) and then issues currency such that the amount in circulation is equivalent to the\nvalue of gold held in reserve. In this way, money is “backed” by gold because individuals are allowed to\nconvert currency to gold on demand.\nToday’s currencies are not backed by gold; instead most countries have a central bank that issues an\namount of currency that will be adequate to maintain a vibrant growing economy with low inflation and\nlow unemployment. A central bank’s ability to achieve these goals is often limited, especially in turbulent\neconomic times, and this makes monetary policy contentious in most countries.\nOne of the decisions a country must make with respect to its currency is whether to fix its exchange value\nand try to maintain it for an extended period, or whether to allow its value to float or fluctuate according\nto market conditions. Throughout history,fixed exchange rates have been the norm, especially because of\nthe long period that countries maintained a gold standard (with currency fixed to gold) and because of the\nfixed exchange rate system (called the Bretton Woods system) after World War II. However, since 1973,\n\nwhen the Bretton Woods system collapsed, countries have pursued a variety of different exchange rate\nmechanisms.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF), created to monitor and assist countries with international\npayments problems, maintains a list of country currency regimes. The list displays a wide variety of\nsystems currently being used. The continuing existence of so much variety demonstrates that the key\nquestion, “Which is the most suitable currency system?” remains largely unanswered. Different countries\nhave chosen differently. Later, this course will explain what is necessary to maintain a fixed exchange rate\nor floating exchange rate system and what are some of the pros and cons of each regime. For now, though,\nit is useful to recognize the varieties of regimes around the world.\nTable 1.4 Exchange Rate Regimes\nCountry/Region Regime\nEuro Area Single currency within: floating externally\nUnited States Float\nChina Crawling peg\nJapan Float\nIndia Managed float\nRussia Fixed to composite\nBrazil Float\nSouth Korea Float\nIndonesia Managed float\nSpain Euro zone; fixed in the European Union; float externally\nSouth Africa Float\nEstonia Currency board\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, De Facto Classification of Exchange Rate Regimes and Monetary\nPolicy Framework, 2008.\nTable 1.4 \"Exchange Rate Regimes\" shows the selected set of countries followed by a currency regime.\nNotice that many currencies—including the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, the South\nKorean won, and the South African rand—are independently floating, meaning that their exchange values\nare determined in the private market on the basis of supply and demand. Because supply and demand for\ncurrencies fluctuate over time, so do the exchange values, which is why the system is called floating.\nNote that India and Indonesia are classified as “managed floating.” This means that the countries’ central\nbanks will sometimes allow the currency to float freely, but at other times will nudge the exchange rate in\none direction or another.\nChina is listed and maintaining a crawling peg, which means that the currency is essentially fixed except\nthat the Chinese central bank is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly with respect to the U.S. dollar.\nIn other words, the fixed rate itself is gradually but unpredictably adjusted.\nEstonia is listed as having a currency board. This is a method of maintaining a fixed exchange rate by\nessentially eliminating the central bank in favor of a currency board that is mandated by law to follow\nprocedures that will automatically keep its currency fixed in value.\nRussia is listed as fixing to a composite currency. This means that instead of fixing to one other currency,\nsuch as the U.S. dollar or the euro, Russia fixes to a basket of currencies, also called a composite currency.\nThe most common currency basket to fix to is the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), a composite currency\nissued by the IMF used for central bank transactions.\nFinally, sixteen countries in the European Union are currently members of the euro area. Within this area,\nthe countries have retired their own national currencies in favor of using a single currency, the euro.\nWhen all countries circulate the same currency, it is the ultimate in fixity, meaning they have fixed\nexchange rates among themselves because there is no need to exchange. However, with respect to other\nexternal currencies, like the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen, the euro is allowed to float freely.\nTrade Balances and International Investment Positions\nOne of the most widely monitored international statistics is a country’s trade balance. If the value of total\nexports from a country exceeds total imports, we say a country has atrade surplus. However, if total\n\nimports exceed total exports, then the country has atrade deficit. Of course, if exports equal imports, then\nthe country has balanced trade.\nThe terminology is unfortunate because it conveys a negative connotation to trade deficits, a positive\nconnotation to trade surpluses, and perhaps an ideal connotation to trade balance. Later in the text, we\nwill explain if or when these connotations are accurate and when they are inaccurate. Suffice it to say, for\nnow, that sometimes trade deficits can be positive, trade surpluses can be negative, and trade balance\ncould be immaterial.\nRegardless, it is popular to decry large deficits as being a sign of danger for an economy, to hail large\nsurpluses as a sign of strength and dominance, and to long for the fairness and justice that would arise if\nonly the country could achieve balanced trade. What could be helpful at an early stage, before delving into\nthe arguments and explanations, is to know how large the countries’ trade deficits and surpluses are. A list\nof trade balances as a percentage of GDP for a selected set of countries is provided in Table 1.5 \"Trade\nBalances and International Investment Positions GDP, 2009\".\nIt is important to recognize that when a country runs a trade deficit, residents of the country purchase a\nlarger amount of foreign products than foreign residents purchase from them. Those extra purchases are\nfinanced by the sale of domestic assets to foreigners. The asset sales may consist of property or businesses\n(a.k.a. investment), or it may involve the sale of IOUs (borrowing). In the former case, foreign\ninvestments entitle foreign owners to a stream of profits in the future. In the latter case, foreign loans\nentitle foreigners to a future repayment of principal and interest. In this way, trade and international\ninvestment are linked.\nBecause of these future profit takings and loan repayments, we say that a country with a deficit is\nbecoming a debtor country. On the other hand, anytime a country runs a trade surplus, it is the domestic\ncountry that receives future profit and is owed repayments. In this case, we say a country running trade\nsurpluses is becoming a creditor country. Nonetheless, trade deficits or surpluses only represent the debts\nor credits extended over a one-year period. If trade deficits continue year after year, then the total external\ndebt to foreigners continues to grow larger. Likewise, if trade surpluses are run continually, then credits\nbuild up. However, if a deficit is run one year followed by an equivalent surplus the second year, rather\nthan extending new credit to foreigners, the surplus instead will represent a repayment of the previous\n\nyear’s debt. Similarly, if a surplus is followed by an equivalent deficit, rather than incurring debt to\nforeigners, the deficit instead will represent foreign repayment of the previous year’s credits.\nAll of this background is necessary to describe a country’s international investment position (IIP), which\nmeasures the total value of foreign assets held by domestic residents minus the total value of domestic\nassets held by foreigners. It corresponds roughly to the sum of a country’s trade deficits and surpluses\nover its entire history. Thus if the value of a country’s trade deficits over time exceeds the value of its trade\nsurpluses, then its IIP will reflect a larger value of foreign ownership of domestic assets than domestic\nownership of foreign assets and we would say the country is a net debtor. In contrast, if a country has\ngreater trade surpluses than deficits over time, it will be a net creditor.\nNote how this accounting is similar to that for the national debt. A country’s national debt reflects the sum\nof the nation’s government budget deficits and surpluses over time. If deficits exceed surpluses, as they\noften do, a country builds up a national debt. Once a debt is present, though, government surpluses act to\nretire some of that indebtedness.\nThe key differences between the two are that the national debt is public indebtedness to both domestic\nand foreign creditors whereas the international debt (i.e., the IIP) is both public and private indebtedness\nbut only to foreign creditors. Thus repayment of the national debt sometimes represents a transfer\nbetween domestic citizens and so in the aggregate has no impact on the nation’s wealth. However,\nrepayment of international debt always represents a transfer of wealth from domestic to foreign citizens.\nTable 1.5 Trade Balances and International Investment Positions GDP, 2009\nCountry/Region Trade Balance (%) Debtor (−)/Creditor (+) Position (%)\nEuro Area −0.9 −17.5\nUnited States −3.1 −24.4\nChina +6.1 +35.1\nJapan +2.7 +50.4\nIndia −0.3 −6.8\nRussia +2.2 +15.1\n\nCountry/Region Trade Balance (%) Debtor (−)/Creditor (+) Position (%)\nBrazil −0.8 −26.6\nSouth Korea +3.8 −57.9\nIndonesia +1.2 −31.4\nSpain −5.7 −83.6\nSouth Africa −5.4 −4.1\nEstonia +5.8 −83.1\nSources: Economist, the IMF, and the China State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

One thing to note is that some of the selected countries are running trade deficits while others\nare running trade surpluses. Overall, the value of all exports in the world must equal the value of all\nimports, meaning that some countries’ trade deficits must be matched with other countries’ trade\nsurpluses. Also, although there is no magic number dividing good from bad, most observers contend that\na trade deficit over 5 percent of GDP is cause for concern and an international debt position over 50\npercent is probably something to worry about. Any large international debt is likely to cause substantial\ndeclines in living standards for a country when it is paid back—or at least if it is paid back.\nThe fact that debts are sometimes defaulted on, meaning the borrower decides to walk away rather than\nrepay, poses problems for large creditor nations. The more money one has lent to another, the more one\nrelies on the good faith and effort of the borrower. There is an oft-quoted idiom used to describe this\n\nproblem that goes, “If you owe me $100, you have a problem, but if you owe me a million dollars,\nthen I have a problem.” Consequently, international creditor countries may be in jeopardy if their credits\nexceed 30, 40, or 50 percent of GDP.\nNote from the data that the United States is running a trade deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP, which is down\nmarkedly from about 6 percent a few years prior. The United States has also been running a trade deficit\nfor more than the past thirty years and as a result has amassed a debt to the rest of the world larger than\nany other country, totaling about $3.4 trillion or almost 25 percent of U.S. GDP. As such, the U.S. is\nreferred to as the largest debtor nation in the world.\nIn stark contrast, during the past twenty-five or more years Japan has been running persistent trade\nsurpluses. As a result, it has amassed over $2.4 trillion of credits to the rest of the world or just over 50\npercent of its GDP. It is by far the largest creditor country in the world. Close behind Japan is China,\nrunning trade surpluses for more than the past ten years and amassing over $1.5 trillion of credits to other\ncountries. That makes up 35 percent of its GDP and makes China a close second to Japan as a major\ncreditor country. One other important creditor country is Russia, with over $250 billion in credits\noutstanding or about 15 percent of its GDP.\nNote that all three creditor nations are also running trade surpluses, meaning they are expending their\ncreditor position by becoming even bigger lenders.\nLike the United States, many other countries have been running persistent deficits over time and have\namassed large international debts. The most sizeable are for Spain and Estonia, both over 80 percent of\ntheir GDPs. Note that Spain continues to run a trade deficit that will add to it international debt whereas\nEstonia is now running a trade surplus that means it is in the process of repaying its debt. South Korea\nand Indonesia are following a similar path as Estonia. In contrast, the Euro area, South Africa, and to a\nlesser degree Brazil and India are following the same path as the United States—running trade deficits\nthat will add to their international debt.",

          "content": "downturns.\n3. Recognize why the economic downturn in the 1930s is called the Great Depression.\nIn 2009 the world was in the midst of the largest economic downturn since the early 1980s. Economic\nproduction was falling and unemployment rising. International trade fell substantially everywhere in the\nworld, while investment both domestically and internationally dried up.\nThe source of these problems was the bursting of a real estate bubble. Bubbles are fairly common in both\nreal estate and stock markets. A bubble is described as a steady and persistent increase in prices in a\nmarket, in this case, in the real estate markets in the United States and abroad. When bubbles are\ndeveloping, many market observers argue that the prices are reflective of true values despite a sharp and\nunexpected increase. These justifications fool many people into buying the products in the hope that the\nprices will continue to rise and generate a profit.\nWhen the bubble bursts, the demand driving the price increases ceases and a large number of participants\nbegin to sell off their product to realize their profit. When these occur, prices quickly plummet. The\ndramatic drop in real estate prices in the United States in 2007 and 2008 left many financial institutions\nnear bankruptcy. These financial market instabilities finally spilled over into the real sector (i.e., the\nsector where goods and services are produced), contributing to a world recession. As the current economic\ncrisis unfolds, there have been many suggestions about similarities between this recession and the Great\nDepression in the 1930s. Indeed, it is common for people to say that this is the biggest economic\ndownturn since the Great Depression. But is it?\nTo understand whether it is or not, it is useful to look at the kind of data used to measure recessions or\ndepressions and to compare what has happened recently with what happened in the past. First, here are\nsome definitions.\nAn economic recession refers to a decline in a country’s measured real gross domestic product (GDP) over\na period usually coupled with an increasing aggregate unemployment rate. In other words, it refers to a\n\ndecline in economic productive activity. How much of a decline is necessary before observers will begin to\ncall it a recession is almost always arguable, although there are a few guidelines one can follow.\nIn the United States, it is typical to define a recession as two successive quarters of negative real GDP\ngrowth. This definition dates to the 1970s and is little more than a rule of thumb, but it is one that has\nbecome widely applied. A more official way to define a recession is to accept the pronouncements of the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). This group of professional economists looks at more\nfactors than just GDP growth rates and will also make judgments about when a recession has begun and\nwhen one has ended. According to the NBER, the current recession began in December 2007 in the\nUnited States. However, it did not proclaim that until December 2008. Although the U.S. economy\ncontracted in the fourth quarter of 2007, it grew in the first two quarters of 2008, meaning that it did not\nfulfill the two successive quarters rule. That wasn’t satisfied until the last two quarters of 2008 both\nrecorded a GDP contraction. As of January 2010, the U.S. economy continues in a recession according to\nthe NBER. [1]\nA very severe recession is referred to as a depression. How severe a recession has to be to be called a\ndepression is also a matter of judgment. In fact in this regard there are no common rules of thumb or\nNBER pronouncements. Some recent suggestions in the press are that a depression is when output\ncontracts by more than 10 percent or the recession lasts for more than two years. Based on the second\ndefinition and using NBER records dating the length of recessions, the United States experienced\ndepressions from 1865 to 1867, 1873 to 1879, 1882 to 1885, 1910 to 1912, and 1929 to 1933. Using this\ndefinition, the current recession could be judged a depression if NBER dates the end of the contraction to\na month after December 2009.\nThe opposite of a recession is an economic expansion or economic boom. Indeed, the NBER measures not\nonly the contractions but the expansions as well because its primary purpose is to identify the U.S.\neconomy’s peaks and troughs (i.e., high points and low points). When moving from a peak to a trough the\neconomy is in a recession, but when moving from a trough to a peak it is in an expansion or boom. The\nterm used to describe all of these ups and downs over time is the business cycle.\nThe business cycle has been a feature of economies since economic activity has been measured. The NBER\nidentifies recessions going back to the 1800s with the earliest listed in 1854. Overall, the NBER has\nclassified thirty-four recessions since 1854 with an average duration of seventeen months. The longest\n\nrecession was sixty-five months from 1873 to 1879, a contraction notable enough to be called the Great\nDepression until another one came along to usurp it in the 1930s. On the upside, the average economic\nexpansion in the United States during this period lasted thirty-eight months, with the longest being 120\nmonths from 1991 to 2001. Interestingly, since 1982 the United States has experienced three of its longest\nexpansions segmented only by relatively mild recessions in 1991 and 2001. This had led some observers to\nproclaim, “The business cycle is dead.” Of course, that was until we headed into the current crisis. (See\nhere for a complete listing of NBER recessions:http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html.)\nThe Recession of 2008–2009\nNext, let’s take a look at how the GDP growth figures look recently and see how they compare with\nprevious periods. First, growth rates refer to the percentage change in real GDP, which means that the\neffects of inflation have been eliminated. The rates are almost always reported in annual terms (meaning\nthe growth rate over a year) even when the period is defined as one quarter. In the United States and most\nother countries, GDP growth rates are reported every quarter, and that rate represents how much GDP\nwould grow during a year if the rate of increase proceeded at the same pace as the growth during that\nquarter. Alternatively, annual growth rates can be reported as the percentage change in real GDP from the\nbeginning to the end of the calendar year (January 1 to December 31).\nTable 1.6 \"U.S. Real GDP Growth and Unemployment Rate, 2007–2009\" presents the quarterly real GDP\ngrowth rates from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 and the corresponding unemployment rate\nthat existed during the middle month of each quarter. Note first that in 2007, GDP growth was a\nrespectable 2 to 3 percent and unemployment was below 5 percent, signs of a healthy economy. However,\nby the first quarter in 2008, GDP became negative although unemployment remained low. Growth\nrebounded to positive territory in the second quarter of 2008 while at the same time unemployment\nbegan to rise rapidly. At this time, there was great confusion about whether the U.S. economy was stalling\nor whether it was experiencing a temporary slowdown. By late 2008, though, speculation about an\nimpending recession came to an end. Three successive quarters of significant GDP decline occurred\nbetween the second quarter of 2008 and the end of the first quarter in 2009, while the unemployment\nrate began to skyrocket. By the middle of 2009, the decline of GDP subsided and reversed to positive\nterritory by the third quarter. However, the unemployment rate continued to rise, though at a slower pace.\nWhat happens next is anyone’s guess, but to get a sense of the severity of this recession it is worth\n\nanalyzing at least two past recessions: that of 1981 to 1982 and the two that occurred in the 1930s, which\ntogether are known as the Great Depression.\nTable 1.6 U.S. Real GDP Growth and Unemployment Rate, 2007–2009\nYear.Quarter Growth Rate (%) Unemployment Rate (%)",

          "content": "World Bank\n\nregime from 1945 to 1973 and after 1973.\nAfter the Great Depression, one of the things policymakers thought was important was to return the\ninternational economy to a system of fixed exchange rates. Before the Depression (i.e., in the 1920s and\nbefore), the world mostly maintained a gold standard. Under such a system, a country establishes two\nrules: first, it fixes its currency value to a weight of gold; second, it establishes convertibility between the\ncurrency and gold. This means that any individual holding the national currency is allowed to cash in the\ncurrency for its equivalent in gold upon demand.\nIn essence, the gold standard derives from a system in which gold itself was used as a currency in\nexchange. Since gold was sufficiently rare and because it was inherently valuable to people, it was an ideal\nsubstance to use as a store of value and a medium of exchange (as was silver). However, once trucking\ngold around became more difficult, it became easier for governments to issue paper currency but to back\nup that currency with gold on reserve. Thus currency in circulation was just a representation of actual\ngold in the government’s vault, and if a person ever wished to see that actual gold, he or she could simply\ndemand conversion.\nThere is much that can be said about how a gold standard operates, but that discussion is reserved for a\nlater chapter. For our purposes here, it is sufficient to explain that the gold standard was a system of fixed\nexchange rates. For example, before the 1930s the United States fixed the dollar at $20.67 per ounce of\ngold. During the same period, the United Kingdom fixed its currency at £4.24 per ounce. As a result of the\ngold-currency convertibility in both countries, this meant the dollar and pound were fixed to each other at\na rate of $4.875/£.\nDuring the Depression years, most countries dropped off the gold standard because the loss of confidence\nthreatened a complete conversion of currency to gold and the depletion of national gold reserves. But, as\nWorld War II drew to a close, experts were assembled in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in the United\nStates in 1944 to design a set of institutions that would help establish an effective international monetary\n\nsystem and to prevent some of the adjustment catastrophes that occurred after World War I. One such\ncatastrophe occurred in Germany in 1922 to 1923 when a floating German currency resulted in one of the\nworst hyperinflations in modern history. Photos from that period show people with wheelbarrows full of\nmoney being used to make basic purchases. One way to prevent a reoccurrence was to establish a system\nof fixed exchange rates. As will be shown later, an important benefit of fixed exchange rates is the\npotential for such a system to prevent excessive inflation.\nThe Bretton Woods Conference, more formally called the United Nations Monetary and Financial\nConference, was held in July 1944. The purpose of the conference was to establish a set of institutions that\nwould support international trade and investment and prevent some of the monetary instabilities that had\nplagued the world after World War I. The conference proposed three institutions, only two of which\nfinally came into being.\nThe unsuccessful institution was the International Trade Organization (ITO), which was intended to\npromote the reduction of tariff barriers and to coordinate domestic policies so as to encourage a freer flow\nof goods between countries. Although a charter was drawn up for the ITO, the United States refused to\nsign onto it, fearing that it would subordinate too many of its domestic policies to international scrutiny. A\nsubagreement of the ITO, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), designed to promote\nmultilateral tariff reductions, was established independently though.\nThe two successfully chartered institutions from the Bretton Woods Conference were\nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).\nThe IBRD is one component of a larger organization called the World Bank. Its purpose was to provide\nloans to countries to aid their reconstruction after World War II and to promote economic development.\nMuch of its early efforts focused on reconstruction of the war-torn economies, but by the 1960s, its efforts\nwere redirected to developing countries. The intent was to get countries back on their feet, economically\nspeaking, as quickly as possible.\nThe second successfully chartered organization was the IMF. Its purpose was to monitor and maintain the\nstability of the fixed exchange rate system that was established. The system was not the revival of a gold\nstandard but rather what is known as a gold-exchange standard. Under this system, the U.S. dollar was\nsingled out as the international reserve currency. Forty-four of the forty-five ratifying countries agreed to\n\nhave their currency fixed to the dollar. The dollar in turn was fixed to gold at $35 per ounce. The countries\nalso agreed not to exchange officially held gold deposits for currency as had been the practice under the\ngold standard. However, countries agreed that officially held gold could be exchanged between central\nbanks.\nAnother important requirement designed to facilitate the expansion of international trade was that\ncountries agreed not to put any restrictions or controls on the exchange of currencies when that exchange\nwas intended for transactions on the current account. In other words, individuals would be free to\nexchange one currency for another if they wanted to import goods from another country. However,\ncurrency controls or restrictions were allowed for transactions recorded on the financial accounts. This\nallowed countries to prevent foreign purchases of businesses and companies or to prevent foreign banks\nfrom lending or borrowing money. These types of restrictions are commonly known\nas capital controls (also, currency controls and/or exchange restrictions). These controls were allowed\nlargely because it was believed they were needed to help maintain the stability of the fixed exchange rate\nsystem.\nThe way a fixed exchange system operates in general, and the way the Bretton Woods gold exchange\nstandard operated in particular, is covered in detail in Chapter 11 \"Fixed Exchange Rates\". For now I will\nsimply state without explanation that to maintain a credible fixed exchange rate system requires regular\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets by country central banks. Sometimes to maintain the fixed\nrate a country might need to sell a substantial amount of U.S. dollars that it is holding on reserve. These\nreserves are U.S. dollar holdings that had been purchased earlier, but sometimes a country can run what\nis called a balance of payments deficit—that is, run out of dollar reserves and threaten the stability of the\nfixed exchange rate system.\nAt the Bretton Woods Conference, participants anticipated that this scenario would be a common\noccurrence and decided that a “fund” be established to essentially “bail out” countries that suffered from\nbalance of payments problems. That fund was the IMF.\nThe IMF was created to help stabilize exchange rates in the fixed exchange rate system. In particular,\nmember countries contribute reserves to the IMF, which is then enabled to lend money to countries\nsuffering balance of payments problems. With these temporary loans, countries can avoid devaluations of\ntheir currencies or other adjustments that can affect the confidence in the monetary system. Because the\n\nmonies used by the IMF are contributions given by other countries in the group, it is expected that once a\nbalance of payments problem subsides that the money will be repaid. To assure repayment the IMF\ntypically establishes conditions, known as conditionality, for the recipients of the loans. These conditions\ngenerally involve changes in monetary and fiscal policies intended to eliminate the original problems with\nthe balance of payments in the first place.\nThe role of the IMF has changed more recently though. The fixed exchange rate system, under which the\nIMF is designed to operate, collapsed in 1973. Since that time, most of the major currencies in the world—\nincluding the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and many others—are floating. When a\ncurrency is allowed to float, its value is determined by supply and demand in the private market and there\nis no longer any need for a country’s central bank to intervene. This in turn means that a country can no\nlonger get into a balance of payments problem since that balance is automatically achieved with the\nadjustment in the exchange rate value. In essence the raison d’être of the IMF disappeared with the\ncollapse of the Bretton Woods system.\nCuriously, the IMF did not fall out of existence. Instead, it reinvented itself as a kind of lender of last\nresort to national governments. After 1973, the IMF used its “fund” to assist national governments that\nhad international debt problems. For example, a major debt crisis developed in the early 1980s when\nnational governments of Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and eventually many other nations were\nunable to pay the interest on their external debt, or the money they borrowed from other countries. Many\nof these loans were either taken by the national governments or were guaranteed by the national\ngovernments. This crisis, known as the Third World debt crisis, threatened to bring down the\ninternational financial system as a number of major banks had significant exposure of foreign loans that\nwere ultimately defaulted on. The IMF stepped in to provide “structural adjustment programs” in this\ninstance. So the IMF not only loaned money for countries experiencing balance of payments crises but\nalso now provided loans to countries that could not pay back their foreign creditors. And also, because the\nIMF wanted to get its money back (meaning the money contributed by the member nations), the\nstructural adjustment loans came with strings attached: IMF conditionality.\nSince that time, the IMF has lent money to many countries suffering from external debt repayment\nproblems. It stepped in to help Brazil and Argentina several times in the 1980s and later. It helped Mexico\n\nduring the peso crisis in 1994. It assisted countries during the Asian currency crisis of 1997 and helped\nRussia one year later when the Asian contagion swept through.\nAlthough the IMF has come under much criticism, especially because conditionality is viewed by some as\nexcessively onerous, it is worth remembering that the IMF makes loans, not grants. Thus it has the\nmotivation to demand changes in policies that raise the chances of being repaid. These conditions have\ngenerally involved things like fiscal and monetary responsibility. That means reducing one’s government\nbudget deficit and curtailing the growth of the money supply. It also prescribed privatization that involves\nthe sale or divestiture of state-owned enterprises. The free market orientation of these conditions came to\nbe known as the Washington Consensus.\nAlso mitigating the criticisms is the fact that the countries that participate in IMF programs are free to\naccept the loans, or not. To illustrate the alternative, Malaysia was one country that refused to participate\nin an IMF structural adjustment program during the Asian currency crisis and as a result did not have to\nsuccumb to any conditions. Thus it is harder to criticize the IMF’s conditions when the countries\nthemselves have volunteered to participate. In exchange for what were often tens of billions of dollars in\nloans, these countries were able to maintain their good standing in the international financial community.\nAlthough controversial, the IMF has played a significant role in maintaining the international financial\nsystem even after the collapse of fixed exchange rates. One last issue worth discussing in this introduction\nis the issue of moral hazard. In the past thirty years or so, almost every time a country has run into\ndifficulty repaying its external debt, the IMF has stepped in to assure continued repayment. That behavior\nsends a signal to international investors that the risk of lending abroad is reduced. After all, if the country\ngets into trouble the IMF will lend the country money and the foreign creditors will still get their money\nback. The moral hazard refers to the fact that lending institutions in the developed countries may view the\nIMF like an insurance policy and thus make much riskier loans than they would have otherwise. In this\nway, the IMF could be contributing to the problem of international financial crisis rather than merely\nbeing the institution that helps clean up the mess.",

          "content": "Many of the key aggregate variables used to describe an economy are presented in a country’s National\nIncome and Product Accounts (NIPA). National income represents the total amount of money that factors\nof production earn during the course of a year. This mainly includes payments of wages, rents, profits, and\ninterest to workers and owners of capital and property. The national product refers to the value of output\nproduced by an economy during the course of a year. National product, also called national output,\nrepresents the market value of all goods and services produced by firms in a country.\nBecause of the circular flow of money in exchange for goods and services in an economy, the value of\naggregate output (the national product) should equal the value of aggregate income (national income).\nConsider the adjoining circular flow diagram, Figure 2.1 \"A Circular Flow Diagram\", describing a very\nsimple economy. The economy is composed of two distinct groups: households and firms. Firms produce\nall the final goods and services in the economy using factor services (labor and capital) supplied by the\nhouseholds. The households, in turn, purchase the goods and services supplied by the firms. Thus goods\nand services move between the two groups in the counterclockwise direction. Exchanges are facilitated\nFigure 2.1 A Circular Flow Diagram with the use of money for payments.\nThus when firms sell goods and services,\nthe households give the money to the\nfirms in exchange. When the households\nsupply labor and capital to firms, the\nfirms give money to the households in\nexchange. Thus money flows between\nthe two groups in a clockwise direction.\nNational product measures the\nmonetary flow along the top part of the\ndiagram—that is, the monetary value of\ngoods and services produced by firms in\n\nthe economy. National income measures the monetary flow along the bottom part of the diagram—that is,\nthe monetary value of all factor services used in the production process. As long as there are no monetary\nleakages from the system, national income will equal national product.\nThe national product is commonly referred to as gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is defined as the\nvalue of all final goods and services produced within the borders of a country during some period of time,\nusually a year. A few things are worth emphasizing about this definition.\nFirst, GDP is measured in terms of the monetary (or dollar) value at which the items exchange in the\nmarket. Second, it measures only final goods and services as opposed to intermediate goods. Thus wheat\nsold by a farmer to a flour mill will not be directly included as part of GDP since the value of the wheat will\nbe included in the value of the flour that the mill sells to the bakery. The value of the flour will in turn be\nincluded in the value of the bread sold to the grocery store. Finally, the value of the bread will be included\nin the price charged by the grocery when the product is finally purchased by the consumer. Only the final\nbread sale should be included in GDP or else the intermediate values would overstate total production in\nthe economy. Finally, GDP must be distinguished from another common measure of national output,\ngross national product (GNP).\nBriefly, GDP measures all production within the borders of the country regardless of who owns the factors\nused in the production process. GNP measures all production achieved by domestic factors of production\nregardless of where that production takes place. For example, if a U.S. resident owns a factory in Malaysia\nand earns profits on the operation of that factory, then those profits would be counted as production by a\nU.S. factory owner and thus would be included in the U.S. GNP. However, since that production took\nplace beyond U.S. borders, it would not be counted as the U.S. GDP. Alternatively, if a Dutch resident\nowns a factory in the United States, then the fraction of that production that accrues to the Dutch owner\nwould be counted as part of the U.S. GDP since the production took place in the United States. It would\nnot be counted as part of the U.S. GNP, however, since the production was done by a foreign factor owner.\nGDP is probably the most widely reported and closely monitored aggregate statistic. GDP is a measure of\nthe size of an economy. It tells us the total amount of “stuff” the economy produces. Since most of us, as\nindividuals, prefer to have more stuff rather than less, it is straightforward to extend this to the national\neconomy to argue that the higher the GDP, the better off the nation. For this simple reason, statisticians\n\ntrack the growth rate of GDP. Rapid GDP growth is a sign of growing prosperity and economic strength.\nFalling GDP indicates a recession, and if GDP falls significantly, we call it an economic depression.\nFor a variety of reasons, GDP should be used only as a rough indicator of the prosperity or welfare of a\nnation. Indeed, many people contend that GDP is an inadequate measure of national prosperity. Below is\na list of some of the reasons why GDP falls short as an indicator of national welfare.\n1. GDP only measures the amount of goods and services produced during the year. It does not measure the\nvalue of goods and services left over from previous years. For example, used cars, two-year-old computers,\nold furniture, old houses, and so on are all useful and provide welfare to individuals for years after they\nare produced. Yet the value of these items is only included in GDP in the year in which they are produced.\nNational wealth, on the other hand, measures the value of all goods, services, and assets available in an\neconomy at a point in time and is perhaps a better measure of national economic well-being than GDP.\n2. GDP, by itself, fails to recognize the size of the population that it must support. If we want to use GDP to\nprovide a rough estimate of the average standard of living among individuals in the economy, then we\nought to divide GDP by the population to get per capita GDP. This is often the way in which cross-country\ncomparisons are made.\n3. GDP gives no account of how the goods and services produced by the economy are distributed among\nmembers of the economy. One might prefer a lower GDP with a more equitable distribution to a higher\nGDP in which a small percentage of the population receives most of the product.\n4. Measured GDP growth may overstate the growth of the standard of living since price level increases\n(inflation) would raise measured GDP. Thus even if the economy produces exactly the same amount of\ngoods and services as the year before and prices of those goods rise, then GDP will rise as well. For this\nreason, real GDP is typically used to measure the growth rate of GDP. Real GDP divides nominal (or\nmeasured) GDP by the price level and is designed to eliminate some of the inflationary effects.\n5. Sometimes, economies with high GDPs may also produce a large amount of negative production\nexternalities. Pollution is one such negative externality. Thus one might prefer to have a lower GDP and\nless pollution than a higher GDP with more pollution. Some groups also argue that rapid GDP growth may\ninvolve severe depletion of natural resources, which may be unsustainable in the long run.\n6. GDP often rises in the aftermath of natural disasters. Shortly after the Kobe earthquake in Japan in the\n1990s, economists predicted that Japan’s GDP would probably rise more rapidly. This is mostly because\n\nof the surge of construction activities required to rebuild the damaged buildings. This illustrates why GDP\ngrowth may not be indicative of a healthy economy in some circumstances.\n7. GDP measures the value of production in the economy rather than consumption, which is more important\nfor economic well-being. As will be shown later, national production and consumption are equal when a\ncountry’s trade balance is zero; however, if a country has a trade deficit, then its national consumption\nwill exceed its production. Ideally, because consumption is pleasurable while production often is not, we\nshould use the measure of national consumption to measure economic well-being rather than GDP.",

          "content": "The national income or product identity describes the way in which the gross domestic product (GDP) is\nmeasured, as the sum of expenditures in various broad spending categories. The identity, shown below,\nsays that GDP is the sum of personal consumption expenditures (C), private investment expenditures (I),\ngovernment consumption expenditures (G), and expenditures on exports (EX) minus expenditures on\nimports (IM):\nGDP = C + I + G + EX − IM.\nPersonal consumption expenditures (C), or “consumption” for short, include goods and services\npurchased by domestic residents. These are further subdivided into durable goods, commodities that can\nbe stored and that have an average life of at least three years; nondurable goods, all other commodities\nthat can be stored; and services, commodities that cannot be stored and are consumed at the place and\ntime of purchase. Consumption also includes foreign goods and services purchased by domestic\nhouseholds.\nPrivate domestic investment (I), or “investment” for short, includes expenditures by businesses on fixed\ninvestment and any changes in business inventories. Fixed investment, both residential and\nnonresidential, consists of expenditures on commodities that will be used in a production process for\nmore than one year. It covers all investment by private businesses and by nonprofit institutions,\nregardless of whether the investment is owned by domestic residents or not. Nonresidential investment\nincludes new construction, business purchases of new machinery, equipment, furniture, and vehicles from\nother domestic firms and from the rest of the world. Residential investment consists of private structures,\nimprovements to existing units, and mobile homes. Note that this term does not include financial\ninvestments made by individuals or businesses. For example, one purchase of stock as an “investment” is\nnot counted here.\nGovernment expenditures include purchases of goods, services, and structures from domestic firms and\nfrom the rest of the world by federal, state, and local government. This category includes compensation\npaid to government employees, tuition payments for higher education, and charges for medical care.\n\nTransfer payments, such as social insurance payments, government medical insurance payments,\nsubsidies, and government aid are not included as a part of government expenditures.\nExports consist of goods and services that are sold to nonresidents.\nImports include goods and services purchased from the rest of the world.\nThe difference between exports and imports (EX − IM) is often referred to as net exports. Receipts and\npayments of factor income and transfer payments to the rest of the world (net) are excluded from net\nexports. Including these terms changes the trade balance definition and reclassifies national output as\ngrowth national product (GNP).\nThe Role of Imports in the National Income Identity\nIt is important to emphasize why imports are subtracted in the national income identity because it can\nlead to serious misinterpretations. First, one might infer (incorrectly) from the identity that imports are\nsubtracted because they represent a cost to the economy. This argument often arises because of the typical\npolitical emphasis on jobs or employment. Thus higher imports imply that goods that might have been\nproduced at home are now being produced abroad. This could represent an opportunity cost to the\neconomy and justify subtracting imports in the identity. However, this argument is wrong.\nThe second misinterpretation that sometimes arises is to use the identity to suggest a relationship\nbetween imports and GDP growth. Thus it is common for economists to report that GDP grew at a slower\nthan expected rate last quarter because imports rose faster than expected. The identity suggests this\nrelationship because, obviously, if imports rise, GDP falls. However, this interpretation is also wrong.\nThe actual reason why imports are subtracted in the national income identity is because imports appear in\nthe identity as hidden elements in consumption, investment, government, and exports. Thus imports\nmust be subtracted to assure that only domestically produced goods are being counted. Consider the\nfollowing details.\nWhen consumption expenditures, investment expenditures, government expenditures, and exports are\nmeasured, they are measured without accounting for where the purchased goods were actually made.\nThus consumption expenditures (C) measures domestic expenditures on both domestically produced and\nforeign-produced goods. For example, if a U.S. resident buys a television imported from Korea, that\npurchase would be included in domestic consumption expenditures. Likewise, if a business purchases a\nmicroscope made in Germany, that purchase would be included in domestic investment. When the\n\ngovernment buys foreign goods abroad to provide supplies for its foreign embassies, those purchases are\nincluded in government expenditures. Finally, if an intermediate product is imported, used to produce\nanother good, and then exported, the value of the original imports will be included in the value of\ndomestic exports.\nThis suggests that we could rewrite the national income identity in the following way:\nGDP = (CD + CF) + (ID + IF) + (GD + GF) + (EXD + EXF) − IM,\nwhere CD represents consumption expenditures on domestically produced goods, CFrepresents\nconsumption expenditures on foreign-produced goods, ID represents investment expenditures on\ndomestically produced goods, IF represents investment expenditures on foreign-produced\ngoods, GD represents government expenditures on domestically produced goods, GF represents\ngovernment expenditures on foreign-produced goods, EXD represents export expenditures on\ndomestically produced goods, and EXF represents export expenditures on previously imported\nintermediate goods. Finally, we note that all imported goods are used in consumption, investment, or\ngovernment or are ultimately exported, thus\nIM = CF + IF + GF + EXF.\nPlugging this expression into the identity above yields\nGDP = CD + ID + GD + EXD\nand indicates that GDP does not depend on imports at all.\nThe reason imports are subtracted in the standard national income identity is because they have already\nbeen included as part of consumption, investment, government spending, and exports. If imports were\nnot subtracted, GDP would be overstated. Because of the way the variables are measured, the national\nincome identity is written such that imports are added and then subtracted again.\nThis exercise should also clarify why the previously described misinterpretations were indeed wrong.\nSince imports do not affect the value of GDP in the first place, they cannot represent an opportunity cost,\nnor do they directly or necessarily influence the size of GDP growth.",

          "content": "To have a solid understanding of the international economy, it is useful to know the absolute and relative\nsizes of some key macroeconomic variables like the gross domestic product (GDP). For example, it is\nworthwhile to know that the U.S. economy is the largest in the world because its annual GDP is about $14\ntrillion, not $14 million or $14 billion. It can also be useful to know about how much of an economy’s\noutput each year is consumed, invested, or purchased by the government. Although knowing that the U.S.\ngovernment expenditures in 2008 were about $2.9 trillion is not so important, knowing that government\nexpenditures made up about 20 percent of GDP can be useful to know.\nTable 2.2 \"U.S. Gross Domestic Product (in Billions of Dollars)\" contains U.S. statistics for the national\nincome and product accounts for the years 2007 and 2008. The table provides the numerical breakdown\nof GDP not only into its broad components (C, I, G, etc.) but also into their major subcategories. For\nexample, consumption expenditures are broken into three main subcategories: durable goods, nondurable\ngoods, and services.

This is\nmeasured in 2008 prices and is referred to as nominal GDP. This number is useful to recall, first because\nit can be used in to judge relative country sizes if you happen to come across another country’s GDP\n\nfigure. The number will also be useful in comparison with U.S. GDP in the future. Thus if in 2020 you\nread that U.S. GDP is $20 trillion, you’ll be able to recall that back in 2008 it was just $14 trillion. Also,\nnote that between 2007 and 2008, the United States added over $600 billion to GDP.\nThe next thing to note about the numbers is that consumption expenditures are the largest component of\nU.S. GDP, making up about 70 percent of output in 2008. That percentage is relatively constant over time,\neven as the economy moves between recessions and boom times (although it is up slightly from 68\npercent in 1997). Notice also that services is the largest subcategory in consumption. This category\nincludes health care, insurance, transportation, entertainment, and so on.\nGross private domestic investment, “investment” for short, accounted for just 14 percent of GDP in 2008.\nThis figure is down from almost 17 percent just two years before and is reflective of the slide into the\neconomic recession. As GDP began to fall at the end of 2008, prospects for future business opportunities\nalso turned sour, and so investment spending also fell. As the recession continued into 2009, we can\nexpect that number to fall even further the next year.\nThe investment component of GDP is often the target of considerable concern in the United States.\nInvestment represents how much the country is adding to the capital stock. Since capital is an input into\nproduction, in general the more capital equipment available, the greater will be the national output. Thus\ninvestment spending is viewed as an indicator of future GDP growth. Perhaps the higher is investment,\nthe faster the economy will grow in the future.\nOne concern about the U.S. investment level is that, as a percentage of GDP, it is lower than in many\ncountries in Europe, especially in China and other Asian economies. In many European countries, it is\nabove 20 percent of GDP. The investment figure is closer to 30 percent in Japan and over 35 percent in\nChina. There was a fear among some observers, especially in the 1980s and early 1990s, that lower U.S.\ninvestment relative to the rest of the world would ultimately lead to slower growth. That this projection\nhas not been borne out should indicate that higher investment is not sufficient by itself to assure higher\ngrowth.\nGovernment expenditures on goods and services in the United States amounted to 20 percent of GDP in\n2008. Due to the recession and the large government stimulus package in 2009, we can expect this\nnumber will rise considerably next year. Recall that this figure includes state, local, and federal spending\n\nbut excludes transfer payments. When transfer payments are included, government spending plus\ntransfers as a percentage of GDP exceeds 30 percent in the United States.\nTwo things are worth noting. First, the state and local spending is almost twice the level of federal\nspending. Second, most of the federal spending is on defense-related goods and services.\nExports in the United States accounted for 13 percent of GDP in 2008 (up from 10 percent in 2003) and\nare closing in on the $2 trillion level. Imports into the United States are at $2.5 trillion, amounting to\nalmost 18 percent of GDP. In terms of the dollar value of trade, the United States is the largest importer\nand exporter of goods and services in the world. However, relative to many other countries, the United\nStates trades less as a percentage of GDP.",

          "content": "The balance of payments accounts is a record of all international transactions that are undertaken\nbetween residents of one country and residents of other countries during the year. The accounts are\ndivided into several subaccounts, the most important being the current account and the financial account.\nThe current account is often further subdivided into the merchandise trade account and the service\naccount. These are each briefly defined in Table 2.3 \"Balance of Payments Accounts Summary\".\nTable 2.3 Balance of Payments Accounts Summary\nRecord of all international transactions for goods and services, income\npayments and receipts, and unilateral transfers. The current account is used\nCurrent Account in the national income identity for GNP.\nRecord of all international transactions for goods only.

The goods\nGoods and Services Account and services account is used in the national income identity for GDP.\nRecord of all international transactions for assets. Assets include bonds,\nFinancial Account Treasury bills, bank deposits, stocks, currency, real estate, etc.\nThe balance on each of these accounts is found by taking the difference between exports and imports.\nCurrent Account\nThe current account (CA) balance is defined as CA = EXG,S,IPR,UT − IMG,S,IPR,UTwhere\nthe G,S,IPR,UT superscript is meant to include exports and imports of goods (G), services (S), income\npayments and receipts (IPR), and unilateral transfers (UT). IfCA > 0, then exports of goods and services\nexceed imports and the country has a current account surplus. If CA < 0, then imports exceed exports and\nthe country has a current account deficit.\nIncome payments represent the money earned (i.e., income) by foreign residents on their investments in\nthe United States. For example, if a British company owns an office building in the United States and\n\nbrings back to the United Kingdom a share of the profit earned there as a part of its income, then this is\nclassified as an income payment on the current account of the balance of payments.\nIncome receipts represent the money earned by domestic residents on their investments abroad. For\nexample, if a U.S. company owns an assembly plant in Costa Rica and brings back to the United States a\nshare of the profit earned there as a part of its income, then this is classified as an income receipt on the\ncurrent account of the balance of payments.\nIt may be helpful to think of income payments and receipts as payments for entrepreneurial services. For\nexample, a British company running an office building is providing the management services and taking\nthe risks associated with operating the property. In exchange for these services, the company is entitled to\na stream of the profit that is earned. Thus income payments are classified as an import, the import of a\nservice. Similarly, the U.S. company operating the assembly plant in Costa Rica is also providing\nentrepreneurial services for which it receives income. Since in this case the United States is exporting a\nservice, income receipts are classified as a U.S. export.\nUnilateral transfers represent payments that are made or received that do not have an offsetting product\nflow in the opposite direction. Normally, when a good is exported, for example, the good is exchanged for\ncurrency such that the value of the good and the value of the currency are equal. Thus there is an outflow\nand an inflow of equal value. An accountant would record both sides of this transaction, as will be seen in\nthe next section. However, with a unilateral transfer, money flows out, but nothing comes back in\nexchange or vice versa. The primary examples of unilateral transfers are remittances and foreign aid.\nRemittances occur when a person in one country transfers money to a relative in another country and\nreceives nothing in return. Foreign aid also involves a transfer, expecting nothing in return.\nMerchandise Trade Balance\nThe merchandise trade balance (or goods balance) can be defined as GB = EXG − IMG, where we record\nonly the export and import of merchandise goods. If GB > 0, the country would have a (merchandise)\ntrade surplus. If GB < 0, the country has a trade deficit.\nServices Balance\nThe service balance can be defined as SB = EXS − IMS, where we record only the export and import of\nservices. If SB > 0, the country has a service surplus. If SB < 0, the country has a service deficit.\nGoods and Services Balance\n\nThe goods and services balance (or goods balance) can be defined as GSB = EXG&S −IMG&S, where we\nrecord the export and import of both merchandise goods and services. If GSB > 0, the country would have\na goods and services (G&S) surplus. If GB< 0, the country has a G&S deficit. Note that sometimes people\nwill refer to the difference EXG&S − IMG&S as net exports. Often when this term is used the person is\nreferencing the goods and services balance.\nHere it is important to point out that when you hear a reference to a country’s trade balance, it could\nmean the merchandise trade balance, or it could mean the goods and services balance, or it could even\nmean the current account balance.\nOccasionally, one will hear trade deficit figures reported in the U.S. press followed by a comment that the\ndeficit figures refer to the “broad” measure of trade between countries. In this case, the numbers reported\nrefer to the current account deficit rather than the merchandise trade deficit. This usage is developing for\na couple of reasons. First of all, at one time, around thirty years ago or more, there was very little\ninternational trade in services. At that time, it was common to report the merchandise trade balance since\nthat accounted for most of the international trade. In the past decade or so, service trade has been\ngrowing much more rapidly than goods trade and it is now becoming a significant component of\ninternational trade. In the United States, service trade exceeds 30 percent of total trade. Thus a more\ncomplete record of a country’s international trade is found in its current account balance rather than its\nmerchandise trade account.\nBut there is a problem with reporting and calling it the current account deficit because most people don’t\nknow what the current account is. There is a greater chance that people will recognize the trade deficit\n(although most could probably not define it either) than will recognize the current account deficit. Thus\nthe alternative of choice among commentators is to call the current account deficit a trade deficit and then\ndefine it briefly as a “broad” measure of trade.\nA simple solution would be to call the current account balance the “trade balance” since it is a record of all\ntrade in goods and services and to call the merchandise trade balance the “merchandise goods balance,” or\nthe “goods balance” for short. I will ascribe to this convention throughout this text in the hope that it\nmight catch on.\nGDP versus GNP\n\nThere are two well-known measures of the national income of a country: GDP and GNP. Both represent\nthe total value of output in a country during a year, only measured in slightly different ways. It is\nworthwhile to understand the distinction between the two and what adjustments must be made to\nmeasure one or the other.\nConceptually, the gross domestic product (GDP) represents the value of all goods and services produced\nwithin the borders of the country. The gross national product (GNP) represents the value of all goods and\nservices produced by domestic factors of production.\nThus production in the United States by a foreign-owned company is counted as a part of U.S. GDP since\nthe productive activity took place within the U.S. borders, even though the income earned from that\nactivity does not go to a U.S. citizen. Similarly, production by a U.S. company abroad will generate income\nfor U.S. citizens, but that production does not count as a part of GDP since the productive activity\ngenerating that income occurred abroad. This production will count as a part of GNP though since the\nincome goes to a U.S. citizen.\nThe way GDP versus GNP is measured is by including different items in the export and import terms. As\nnoted above, GDP includes only exports and imports of goods and services, implying also that GDP\nexcludes income payments and receipts and unilateral transfers. When these latter items are included in\nthe national income identity and the current account balance is used for EX − IM, the national income\nvariable becomes the GNP. Thus the GNP measure includes income payments and receipts and unilateral\ntransfers. In so doing, GNP counts as additions to national income the profit made by U.S. citizens on its\nforeign operations (income receipts are added to GNP) and subtracts the profit made by foreign\ncompanies earning money on operations in the U.S. (income payments are subtracted).\nTo clarify, the national income identities for GDP and GNP are as follows:\nGDP = C + I + G + EXG&S − IMG&S\nand\nGNP = C + I + G + EXG,S,IPR,UT − IMG,S,IPR,UT.\nFinancial Account Balance\nFinally, the financial account balance can be defined as KA = EXA − IMA, where EXAand IMA refer to the\nexport and import of assets, respectively. If KA > 0, then the country is exporting more assets than it is\n\nimporting and it has a financial account surplus. If KA < 0, then the country has a financial account\ndeficit.\nThe financial account records all international trade in assets. Assets represent all forms of ownership\nclaims in things that have value. They include bonds, Treasury bills, stocks, mutual funds, bank deposits,\nreal estate, currency, and other types of financial instruments. Perhaps a clearer way to describe exports\nof assets is to say thatdomestic assets are sold to foreigners, whereas imports of assets mean foreign\nassets that are purchased by domestic residents.\nIt is useful to differentiate between two different types of assets. First, some assets represent IOUs (i.e., I\nowe you). In the case of bonds, savings accounts, Treasury bills, and so on, the purchaser of the asset\nagrees to give money to the seller of the asset in return for an interest payment plus the return of the\nprincipal at some time in the future. These asset purchases represent borrowing and lending. When the\nU.S. government sells a Treasury bill (T-bill), for example, it is borrowing money from the purchaser of\nthe T-bill and agrees to pay back the principal and interest in the future. The Treasury bill certificate, held\nby the purchaser of the asset, is an IOU, a promissory note to repay principal plus interest at a\npredetermined time in the future.\nThe second type of asset represents ownership shares in a business or property, which is held in the\nexpectation that it will realize a positive rate of return in the future. Assets, such as common stock, give\nthe purchaser an ownership share in a corporation and entitle the owner to a stream of dividend\npayments in the future if the company is profitable. The future sale of the stock may also generate a\ncapital gain if the future sales price is higher than the purchase price. Similarly, real estate purchases—\nsay, of an office building—entitle the owner to the future stream of rental payments by the tenants in the\nbuilding. Owner-occupied real estate, although it does not generate a stream of rental payments, does\ngenerate a stream of housing services for the occupant-owners. In either case, if real estate is sold later at\na higher price, a capital gain on the investment will accrue.\nAn important distinction exists between assets classified as IOUs and assets consisting of ownership\nshares in a business or property. First of all, IOUs involve a contractual obligation to repay principal plus\ninterest according to the terms of the contract or agreement. Failure to do so is referred to as a default on\nthe part of the borrower and is likely to result in legal action to force repayment. Thus international asset\npurchases categorized as IOUs represent international borrowing and lending.\n\nOwnership shares, on the other hand, carry no such obligation for repayment of the original investment\nand no guarantee that the asset will generate a positive rate of return. The risk is borne entirely by the\npurchaser of the asset. If the business is profitable, if numerous tenants can be found, or if real estate\nvalues rise over time, then the purchaser of the asset will make money. If the business is unprofitable,\noffice space cannot be leased, or real estate values fall, then the purchaser will lose money. In the case of\ninternational transactions for ownership shares, there is no resulting international obligation for\nrepayment.",

Learn the interrelationship between a country’s current account balance and its financial\naccount balance and how to interpret current account deficits and surpluses in terms of the\nassociated financial flows.\nIn this section, we demonstrate how international transactions are recorded on the balance of payment\naccounts. The balance of payments accounts can be presented in ledger form with two columns. One\ncolumn is used to record credit entries. The second column is used to record debit entries.\nAlmost every transaction involves an exchange between two individuals of two items believed to be of\nequal value. [1] Thus if one person exchanges $20 for a baseball bat with another person, then the two\nitems of equal value are the $20 of currency and the baseball bat. The debit and credit columns in the\nledger are used to record each side of every transaction. This means that every transaction must result in a\ncredit and debit entry of equal value.\nBy convention, every credit entry has a “+” placed before it, while every debit entry has a “−” placed before\nit. The plus on the credit side generally means that money is being received in exchange for that item,\nwhile the minus on the debit side indicates a monetary payment for that item. This interpretation in the\nbalance of payments accounts can be misleading, however, since in many international transactions, as\nwhen currencies are exchanged, money is involved on both sides of the transaction. There are two simple\nrules of thumb to help classify entries on the balance of payments:\n1. Any time an item (good, service, or asset) is exported from a country, the value of that item is recorded as\na credit entry on the balance of payments.\n2. Any time an item is imported into a country, the value of that item is recorded as a debit entry on the\nbalance of payments.\nIn the following examples, we will consider entries on the U.S. balance of payments accounts. Since it is a\nU.S. account, the values of all entries are denominated in U.S. dollars. Note that each transaction between\na U.S. resident and a foreign resident would result in an entry on both the domestic and the foreign\nbalance of payments accounts, but we will look at only one country’s accounts.\n\nFinally, we will classify entries in the balance of payments accounts into one of the two major\nsubaccounts, the current account or the financial account. Any time an item in a transaction is a good or a\nservice, the value of that item will be recorded in the current account. Any time an item in a transaction is\nan asset, the value of that item will be recorded in the financial account.\nNote that in June 1999, what was previously called the “capital account” was renamed the “financial\naccount” in the U.S. balance of payments. A capital account stills exists but now includes only exchanges\nin nonproduced, nonfinancial assets. This category is very small, including such items as debt forgiveness\nand transfers by migrants. However, for some time, it will be common for individuals to use the term\n“capital account” to refer to the present “financial account.” So be warned.\nA Simple Exchange Story\nConsider two individuals, one a resident of the United States, the other a resident of Japan. We will follow\nthem through a series of hypothetical transactions and look at how each of these transactions would be\nrecorded on the balance of payments. The exercise will provide insight into the relationship between the\ncurrent account and the financial account and give us a mechanism for interpreting trade deficits and\nsurpluses.\nStep 1: We begin by assuming that each individual wishes to purchase something in the other country.\nThe U.S. resident wants to buy something in Japan and thus needs Japanese currency (yen) to make the\npurchase. The Japanese resident wants to buy something in the United States and thus needs U.S.\ncurrency (dollars) to make the purchase. Therefore, the first step in the story must involve an exchange of\ncurrencies.\nSo let’s suppose the U.S. resident exchanges $1,000 for ¥112,000 on the foreign exchange market at a spot\nexchange rate of 112 ¥/$. The transaction can be recorded by noting the following:\n1. The transaction involves an exchange of currency for currency. Since currency is an asset, both sides of\nthe transaction are recorded on the financial account.\n2. The currency exported is $1,000 in U.S. currency. Hence, we have made a credit entry in the financial\naccount in the table below. What matters is not whether the item leaves the country, but that the\nownership changes from a U.S. resident to a foreign resident.\n3. The currency imported into the country is the ¥112,000. We record this as a debit entry on the financial\naccount and value it at the current exchange value, which is $1,000 as noted in the table.\n\nU.S. Balance of Payments ($)\nCredits (+) Debits (−)\nStep 1 Current Account 0\nFinancial Account +1,000 ($ currency) −1,000 (¥ currency)\nStep 2: Next, let’s assume that the U.S. resident uses his ¥112,000 to purchase a camera from a store in\nJapan and then brings it back to the United States. Since the transaction is between the U.S. resident and\nthe Japanese store owner, it is an international transaction and must be recorded on the balance of\npayments. The item exported in this case is the Japanese currency. We’ll assume that there has been no\nchange in the exchange rate and thus the currency is still valued at $1,000. This is recorded as a credit\nentry on the financial account and labeled “¥ currency” in the table below. The item being imported into\nthe United States is a camera. Since a camera is a merchandise good and is valued at ¥112,000 = $1,000,\nthe import is recorded as a debit entry on the current account in the table below.\nU.S. Balance of Payments ($)\nCredits (+) Debits (−)\nStep 2 Current Account 0\nFinancial Account +1,000 (¥ currency) 0\nStep 3a: Next, let’s assume that the Japanese resident uses his $1,000 to purchase a computer from a\nstore in the United States and then brings it back to Japan. The computer, valued at $1,000, is being\nexported out of the United States and is considered a merchandise good. Therefore, a credit entry of\n$1,000 is made in the following table on the current account and labeled as “computer.” The other side of\nthe transaction is the $1,000 of U.S. currency being given to the U.S. store owner by the Japanese\nresident. Since the currency, worth $1,000, is being imported and is an asset, a $1,000 debit entry is\nmade in the table on the financial account and labeled “$ currency.”\nU.S. Balance of Payments ($)\nStep 3a Credits (+) Debits (−)\n\nU.S. Balance of Payments ($)\nStep 3a Credits (+) Debits (−)\nCurrent Account +1,000 (computer)\nFinancial Account 0 −1,000 ($ currency)",

This value is equal\nto the sum of lines 3, 4, and 13.\nLine 3, $1.27 trillion, shows exports of merchandise goods. This includes any physical items that leave the\ncountry.\nLine 4, $549 billion, shows exports of services to foreigners. This category includes travel services,\npassenger fares, royalties, license fees, insurance legal services, and other private services.\nLine 13, $761 billion, shows income receipts on U.S. assets abroad. This represents profits and interest\nearned by U.S. residents on investments in other countries. In a sense, these are payments for services\nrendered where the services include entrepreneurial services in the case of foreign-operated factories, or\nmonetary services in the case of interest and dividend payments on foreign securities. This line is included\nin a measure of gross national product (GNP) since this income is accruing to U.S. factors of production.\nHowever, the line is excluded from a measure of gross domestic product (GDP) since production did not\n\ntake place within the borders of the country. Income receipts are divided into four subcategories: direct\ninvestment receipts, other private receipts, U.S. government receipts, and compensation of employees.\nLine 14, $370 billion, shows direct investment receipts. This represents profit earned by U.S. companies\non foreign direct investment (FDI), where FDI is defined as a greater than 10 percent ownership share in a\nforeign company. Note that this is not new investments but rather the profit and dividends earned on\nprevious investments.\nLine 15, $385 billion, shows other private receipts. This category includes interest and profit earned by\nindividuals, businesses, investment companies, mutual funds, pension plans, and so on. In effect, all\nprivate investment income that accrues on investments worth less than 10 percent of a company would be\nincluded here.\nLine 16, $4.9 billion, shows U.S. government income receipts. This refers to interest and other income\nearned by government investments abroad. Notice that this item is very small compared to the other two\nincome categories.\nLine 18, $3.1 trillion, records imports of goods, services, and income. This value is equal to the sum of\nlines 20, 21, and 30.\nLine 20, $2.1 trillion, shows imports of merchandise goods. Notice that goods imports make up about\ntwo-thirds of total imports.\nLine 21, $405 billion, shows imports of services such as travel services, passenger fares, insurance, and so\non.\nLine 30, $636 billion, shows income payments on foreign assets in the United States. This corresponds to\nincome earned by foreigners who operate companies in the United States or income earned on other U.S.-\nbased assets held by foreigners. This entry is further divided into four components: direct investment\npayments, other private payments, U.S. government payments, and compensation of employees.\nLine 31, $120 billion, records direct investment payments to foreigners in the United States. This\nrepresents profit earned on foreign direct investment by foreign residents’ companies, where FDI is\ndefined as a greater than 10 percent ownership share in a U.S. company. Note that this is not new\ninvestments but rather the profit and dividends earned on previous investments.\nLine 32, $349 billion, reports other private payments. This category includes interest and profit earned by\nindividuals, businesses, investment companies, mutual funds, pension plans, and so on. In effect, all\n\nprivate investment income that accrues on investments worth less than 10 percent of a company would be\nincluded here.\nLine 33, $165 billion, records payments made by the U.S. government to foreigners. This item represents\nmostly interest payments on U.S. Treasury bills owned by foreigners.\nLine 35, $128 billion, records net unilateral transfers. These transfers refer to government grants to\nforeign nations, government pension payments, and private remittances to family and friends abroad. A\ndebit entry here means that the net transfers are outbound, that is, more transfers are made from the U.S.\nto individuals abroad than are made in the reverse direction.\nCapital Account\nLine 39, $953 million, represents net capital account transactions.\nFinancial Account\nLine 40, $106 million, shows the value of purchases of foreign assets by U.S. residents, hence it is referred\nto as a capital outflow. The line is the sum of U.S. official reserve assets (line 41), U.S. government assets\n(line 46), and U.S. private assets (line 50).\nLine 41, $4.8 billion, represents net U.S. official reserve transactions. Any purchases or sales of foreign\ncurrency in a foreign exchange intervention by the central bank would be recorded here. Since the item is\na debit entry, it means that the U.S. central bank made net purchases of foreign assets (currencies) in\n2008.\nIt is worth noting that this line is more important for a country maintaining a fixed exchange rate. To\nmaintain a credible fixed exchange rate, central banks must periodically participate in the foreign\nexchange market. This line measures the extent of that participation and is sometimes referred to as the\n“balance of payments” in a fixed exchange rate system.\nLine 46, $529 billion, represents net purchases of assets by the U.S. government, though not by the\nFederal Reserve.\nLine 50, $534 billion, shows private purchases of foreign assets by U.S. residents. It is the primary\ncomponent of total U.S. assets abroad. The item is composed of direct investment (line 51), foreign\nsecurities (line 52), U.S. claims reported by U.S. nonbanks (line 53), and U.S. claims reported by U.S.\nbanks (line 54).\n\nLine 51, $332 billion, shows direct investment by U.S. residents abroad. It would include purchases of\nfactories, stocks, and so on by U.S. businesses and affiliates in foreign countries as long as there is a\ncontrolling interest in excess of 10 percent voting share.\nLine 52, $60 billion, shows net purchases of foreign stocks and bonds by U.S. individuals and businesses\nwhen there is no controlling interest in the foreign company. Most purchases by U.S. mutual funds,\npension funds, and insurance companies would be classified here.\nLine 53, $372 billion, shows U.S. resident purchases of foreign assets reported by nonbanks.\nLine 54, $433 billion, reports U.S. resident purchases of foreign assets reported by U.S. banks. This may\ninclude items like foreign currency denominated demand deposits held by U.S. businesses and individuals\nin U.S. banks.\nLine 55, $534 billion, shows the sum total of foreign assets in the United States. This item refers to all\npurchases of U.S. assets by foreign residents, thus, it is listed as a capital inflow. This line is composed of\nthe sum of foreign official assets in the United States (line 56), and other foreign assets in the United\nStates (line 63).\nLine 56, $487 billion, refers to purchases of U.S. assets by foreign governments or foreign central banks.\nLine 63, $47 billion, refers to all other foreign assets purchases of U.S. assets and is the main component\nof capital inflows. It is composed of direct investment (line 64), U.S. Treasury securities (line 65), U.S.\nsecurities other than T-bills (line 66), U.S. currency (line 67), U.S. liabilities reported by U.S. nonbanks\n(line 68), and U.S. liabilities reported by U.S. banks (line 69).\nLine 64, $319 billion, refers to purchases of U.S. factories and stocks when there is a greater than 10\npercent ownership share.\nLine 65, $196 billion, shows total purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by foreigners. This corresponds to\nforeign loans to the U.S. government.\nLine 66, $126 billion, shows non-U.S. Treasury bill and nondirect investment purchases of stocks and\nbonds by foreigners.\nLine 67, $29 billion, a credit entry, represents U.S. currency that has been repatriated (net). Typically, this\nflow is a credit indicating an outflow of U.S. currency. Because of the expectation that the U.S. dollar will\nremain stable in value, it is often held by residents in inflationary countries to prevent the deterioration of\npurchasing power. It is estimated that over $270 billion of U.S. currency circulates abroad and is used in\n\nexchange for foreign goods and services or simply held to store value. The value on line 67 represents only\nthe amount that flowed back in 2007.\nLine 68, $45 billion, shows deposits and purchases of U.S. assets by foreigners reported by U.S.\nnonbanks.\nLine 69, $326 billion, reports deposits and purchases of U.S. assets by foreigners reported by U.S. banks.\nThus if a foreign resident opens a checking account in a U.S. bank denominated in U.S. dollars, that value\nwould be recorded here.\nLine 71, $200 billion, represents the statistical discrepancy. It is the sum of all the above items with the\nsign reversed. It is included to satisfy the accounting requirement that all debit entries be balanced by\ncredit entries of equal value. Thus when the statistical discrepancy is included, the balance on the\ncomplete balance of payments is zero.",

Interpret the interrelationships of trade balances and budget balances in terms of the sources\nand uses of funds in the financial system.\nOne of the important relationships among aggregate economic variables is the so-called twin-\ndeficit identity, a term in reference to a country’s government budget deficit and a simultaneous current\naccount deficit. The name for this identity became commonplace during the 1980s and 1990s because at\nthat time the United States experienced deficits in both of these accounts. Now, as we will see later, the\nidentity will be a misnomer in many circumstances since there is no reason that “twin” deficits need to\nalways appear together on these two national accounts. In fact, some countries will, at times, experience a\ndeficit on one account and a surplus on the other. Also, at times, a country will experience a surplus on\nboth accounts.\nThus a better title to this section would be “The Relationship between a Country’s Government Budget\nDeficit and Its Current Account Deficit.” However, since 2004, the United States finds itself back in the\ntwin-deficit scenario, and since “twin-deficit identity” rolls off the tongue much more easily, we will stick\nto this title.\nTo understand this identity it will be helpful to take a much more careful look at the national income\nidentity. This time I will build up the identity in a stepwise fashion using a circular flow diagram to better\nvisualize the flows of money within an economy. A circular flow diagram is typically one of the first\nprinciples shown to students in an introductory macroeconomics class. Its purpose is to show the flow of\nmoney between the major players (or agents) within an economy. Circular flow diagrams can be either\nsimple or complex depending on how many agents one introduces into the system and how finely one\nwishes to break down the monetary flows.\nCircular Flow: Version 1\nThe simplest version of a circular flow diagram considers an economy consisting of two agents:\nhouseholds and firms. We imagine that firms produce goods and services using labor as an input.\n\nThe flow of money is shown in Figure 2.2 \"The Simplest Circular Flow\". The C arrow represents the dollar\nvalue of consumption expenditures made by households to purchase the goods and services produced and\nsold by firms. (The goods and services flow could\nFigure 2.2 The Simplest Circular Flow\nbe represented by an arrow in the opposite\ndirection to C, but we leave that out for\nsimplicity.) Since we assume in this case that there\nare only households buying goods, all GNP\nconsists of C. The money that flows to firms from\nsales of consumption goods is given to the\nworkers in exchange for their labor services. This\nmonetary flow is represented by the arrow\nlabeled “disposable income.” Disposable\nincome is all the money households have to\nspend, which in this case is equal to the\nnational income (NI).\nNote especially that we use GNP rather than GDP as our measure of national income so that flows with\nthe rest of the world later are properly defined.\nCircular Flow: Version 2\nFigure 2.3 The Circular Flow Adding Financial\nThe circular flow can be extended one step by\nInstitutions\nadding financial institutions in Figure 2.3 \"The\nCircular Flow Adding Financial Institutions\".\nFinancial institutions represent any company\nthat facilitates borrowing and lending; the\nprime example is a bank. However, they may\nalso include investment companies, pension\nfunds, and mutual funds. The presence of\nfinancial institutions allows some money to be\ndiverted from the consumption flow. In Figure\n2.3 \"The Circular Flow Adding Financial\n\nInstitutions\", these diversions are represented by SHH, representing household savings and SB,\nrepresenting business saving. Some of the revenue earned by firms is not actually given out to workers in\nthe form of wages. Instead some money is “retained” in the form of profit and excess earnings. These\nretained earnings are generally used to purchase investment goods to help an industry replace worn-out\ncapital equipment and to add new capital. Much of these retained earnings may be used directly to\npurchase new capital equipment, although some of it will be saved by depositing it in a financial\ninstitution. For simplicity we will imagine that all such business saving flows through the financial system,\nhence the SB arrow. In addition, households generally hold back some of their income from spending and\ndeposit it into pension plans, savings accounts, and so on. Thus we include the arrow from households.\nThe easiest way to think of the diagram is to imagine that financial institutions take deposits from firms\nand households and then lend out the money to finance investment spending, I. With some exceptions,\nthis is the way it will often work. One notable exception is that some of the money lent by banks is often\nused to finance consumption rather than investment. This occurs whenever households finance\nconsumption spending using a credit card. However, we can avoid this complication by defining SHH as\nbeing “net” savings, where the net means “after subtracting household borrowing.” With this definition in\nmind, it should be clear that SHH can be negative—that is, its flow reversed—if household borrowing\nexceeds household saving.\nWe can now identify several important relationships. The first one relates to an important decision made\nby households. They choose how much of their disposable income should be spent on consumption and\nhow much should be saved. You may recall from previous courses that the fraction of income spent on\nconsumption goods (from an extra dollar of income) is called the marginal propensity to consume, while\nthe fraction of income saved is called the marginal propensity to save.\nA second relationship is shown on the left side of the Firms box. This indicates that GNP is equal to the\nsum of C and I. This version of the national income identity would only be valid if there were no\ngovernment sector and no trade with the rest of the world.\nA third important relationship is shown by noting the flow of money in and out of the financial sector.\nThere we see two arrows flowing in (i.e., SHH and SB) and one flow outward (i.e., I). This leads to the\nidentity\nSHH + SB = I,\n\nindicating that the sum of household and business saving equals investment. A more common\nsimplification of this relationship is shown by noting the following:\nSP = SHH + SB,\nwhere SP is called private saving. Thus private saving equals the sum of household saving and business\nsaving. This will simplify the above identity to\nSP = I,\nor simply, private saving equals investment. Note that the term “private” is used here to distinguish it\nfrom government (or public sector) saving, which we’ll include next.\nCircular Flow: Version 3\nFigure 2.4 The Circular Flow Adding Government\nNext, let’s add in the government sector\nin Figure 2.4 \"The Circular Flow Adding\nGovernment\". The government is shown both\nto take money out of the circular flow and to\ninject money back in. Money is withdrawn first\nin the form of taxes (T). In the adjoining\ndiagram, taxes are represented as a flow of\nmoney directly from firms, as if it is\nentirely a tax on income. This is a\nsimplification since in reality taxes are\ncollected in many forms from many\ndifferent agents. For example,\ngovernments collect profit taxes from firms\nand financial institutions, sales and property taxes from households, and tariffs on traded goods (not\nincluded yet). All of these taxes are assumed to be lumped together in the T flow and withdrawn directly\nfrom national income.\nTax revenues (TR) can be spent in two separate ways. The TR flow represents transfer payments injected\ninto the household income stream. Transfer payments include social security paid to retired workers,\nMedicaid and welfare payments, unemployment, and so on. These are government expenditures that do\nnot exchange for a particular good or service. The second type of expenditure is G. G represents spending\n\nby government for the purchase of goods and services produced by firms. It includes defense spending,\neducation, police and fire protection, and so on.\nThe final monetary flow, shown flowing out of the government, is labeled SG and refers to government\nsaving. It should be obvious that the money collected by government in the form of taxes need not always\nequal government expenditures. In the event that tax revenues exceed expenditures, the government\nwould have extra money left over. We imagine that this money would be saved in the financial sector since\nit is always better to collect interest when possible. Hence we draw the flow of excess funds, government\nsaving (SG), flowing from government into the financial sector.\nWe can now represent the flow of funds in and out of the government sector with the following identity:\nSG = T − TR − G.\nWhen T exceeds the sum of TR and G, the government has extra saving that flows into the financial sector.\nThese funds would then be available to lend out and finance additional investment.\nOf course, what is more typical of many governments is for the sum of TR and G to exceed tax revenue, T.\nIn this case, the flow of government saving (SG) would be negative and would be represented in the\ndiagram as a flow in the opposite direction. In this case, the government would be borrowing money from\nthe financial sector to finance its excess expenditures. We would also say that the government is running a\nbudget deficit.\nIn short, negative government saving, that is, SG < 0, implies a government budget deficit, which the\ngovernment finances by borrowing from the financial sector.\nOtherwise, positive government saving, that is, SG > 0, implies a government budget surplus, which\nresults either in additions to saving or a repayment of previous debt.\nNext, in this version of the circular flow, we can represent the national income identity as the flow of\nmoney into firms. In this case, GNP equals the sum of C, I, and G. This version would only be Accurate\nwhen there is no trade with the rest of the world.\nLastly, with government included, we must rewrite the relationship representing the flows in and out of\nthe financial sector. This now becomes\nSHH + SB + SG = I.\nThis identity says that the sum of household, business, and government saving must equal private\ninvestment expenditures.\n\nCircular Flow: Version 4\nFigure 2.5 The Circular Flow Adding the RoW\nThe final circular flow diagram shown in Figure\n2.5 \"The Circular Flow Adding the RoW\" extends\nthe previous version to include trade flows with\nthe rest of the world. The rest of the world\n(RoW) is shown at the very bottom of the\nadjoining diagram, below the dotted line, which\nrepresents the border. Trade with the RoW\nconsists first of exports of goods, services,\nincome and transfers, and expenditures on\nexports (EX), represented by a flow into firms\nsince money is being used by foreigners to\npurchase the exported products. Second,\nimports of goods, services, income and transfers,\nand imports (IM) are subtracted from firms,\nresulting in an arrow from firms to the RoW.\nThis adjustment accounts for the fact that measured expenditures made by households, the government,\nand firms in a open economy will consist of purchases of both domestic and imported goods. Thus\nthe C, I, and G flows will include their purchases of imports, and these should not be included as part of\nGNP. In essence, the money used to buy imported products is redirected to the foreign firms, hence we\nhave the outflow of money. (For a more complete explanation see Chapter 2 \"National Income and the\nBalance of Payments Accounts\", Section 2.1 \"National Income and Product Accounts\".)\nThis completes the national income identity with all major sectors included and now becomes\nGNP = C + I + G + EX − IM,\nwhich is represented by the flow of money into (and away from) firms on the left side of the diagram.\nHowever, as noted elsewhere, EX − IM, the balance on the current account, need not be equal to zero.\nIf EX − IM > 0, then the country would have a current account (CA) surplus, whereas if EX − IM < 0 the\ncountry would have a CA deficit.\n\nConsider when EX − IM < 0. In this case, more money flows out to purchase imports than flows back in to\npurchase exports. Essentially, there is a loss of money to the RoW despite some exceptions; however, this\nmoney does not remain outside the country. Instead, it is brought right back in and deposited into\nfinancial institutions (shown as the SF flow on the diagram). In other words, it is saved. This saving\nrepresents the country’s financial account surplus, which is equal and opposite to the CA deficit\n(see Chapter 2 \"National Income and the Balance of Payments Accounts\",Section 2.5 \"Recording\nTransactions on the Balance of Payments\" for a more complete explanation).\nThe key point is that foreign saving offsets the CA deficit. This can be represented by the relationship\nshowing the inflows and outflows from the RoW, namely,\nSF = IM − EX.\nThis says that foreign saving equals the CA deficit. From the perspective of the foreigners, we would refer\nto SF as money saved or lent to the domestic country. From the perspective of the domestic\ncountry, SF would be considered money borrowed from the RoW.\nClearly, since a country may run a surplus on trade (i.e., EX − IM > 0), SF could also be negative. In this\ncase, the RoW would either be dissaving, meaning it is withdrawing previously accumulated saving from\nthe domestic country, or the RoW would be borrowing money from the domestic country. This would\noccur if a domestic bank makes a loan to someone abroad. Alternatively, from the perspective of the\ndomestic country, we can say it is lending money to the RoW when SF < 0.\nFinally, the Twin-Deficit Identity\nThe twin-deficit identity is derived by accounting for the monetary flows in and out of the financial sector\nin version four of the circular flow. This results in the following identity:\nSHH + SB + SG + SF = I.\nThis says that the sum of household saving, business saving, government saving, and foreign saving must\nequal private investment spending. An equivalent version can be written by recalling that household plus\nbusiness saving equals private saving to get\nSP + SG + SF = I.\nThe identity is best interpreted by noting that there are four key sources for funds in the financial sector\nthat are not part of the consumption stream. The pool of funds to finance investment can be drawn from\n\nhouseholds, businesses, the government, or from the RoW. Also, the sum of all funds not used for\nconsumption must be equal to the amount spent on investment goods.\nIt is important to note that this relationship is an accounting identity. This means that the relationship\nmust be true as long as all variables are measured properly. This is notan economic theory, which is a\nproposition that may or may not be true. In practice, this identity rarely adds up, however, because the\nvariables are not typically measured accurately.\nTo turn this identity into the “twin-deficit” identity, we must merely take note of several previous\ndefinitions. Recall that\nSG = T − TR − G,SF = IM − EX,\nand\nSP = SHH + SB.\nPlugging these into identity 1 above yields\nSP + T − TR − G + IM − EX = I.\nReorder these to get the following twin-deficit identity:\n(SP − I) + (IM − EX) = (G + TR − T).\nThis is a popular way of writing the twin-deficit identity since it explicitly indicates two deficits. If the\nsecond expression (IM − EX) > 0, then the country has a current account deficit (i.e., a trade deficit). If\nthe right-hand-side expression (G + TR − T) > 0, then the country has a government budget deficit. The\nexpression in total, then, demonstrates that these two deficits are related to each other according to this\naccounting identity. Indeed, the difference between the government budget deficit and the trade deficit\nmust equal the difference between private saving and investment as shown here:\n(SP − I) = (G + TR − T) − (IM − EX).\nThe Twin-Deficit Relationship in the United States and China\nPerhaps the best way to get a feel for the twin-deficit relationship in a country is to look at the\nnumbers. Table 2.7 \"U.S. Twin-Deficit Figures (GDP), 1997–2008\" and Table 2.8 \"China Twin-Deficit\nFigures (GDP), 1997–2007\" show values for the twin-deficit identity in the United States and in China\nover the past ten years or so. All values are presented as a percentage of GDP. Also, because the data on\nthe balance of payments never add up, which results in a statistical discrepancy term, the twin-deficit\nidentity numbers do not add up. To avoid that problem, the private saving numbers presented are not the\n\nactual reported values but the values saving would have to be to assure the twin-deficit identity adds up—\nthat is, it is derived as a residual value.\nTable 2.7 U.S. Twin-Deficit Figures (GDP), 1997–2008\n(Sp − I) + Current Account Deficit = Govt.

See China Statistical Yearbooks located\nat http://chinadataonline.org/member/yearbooksp/default.asp?StartYear=1981&EndYear=2009&IFFirst\n=yes&page=2.\nThe twin-deficit numbers reveal some interesting patterns. As of the most recent data (2008), the United\nStates has twin deficits, with a CA deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP and a government budget deficit of 4.2\npercent. Since these numbers are almost equal, it is as if the U.S. government deficit, which must be\nfinanced with borrowing, is being financed by borrowed funds from abroad. In the previous year, 2007,\ngovernment borrowing requirements were much lower, at 1.6 percent, but borrowing from foreigners was\nhigher at 5.3 percent. The extra borrowing allowed the U.S. savings rate to remain much lower than the\nprivate investment requirement. We can interpret this year as one in which private investment was mostly\nfinanced with borrowings from abroad.\n\nThe United States has had twin deficits since 2001, when it finished a four-year run with a trade deficit\nand a government budget surplus. This demonstrates that twin “deficits” do not always arise despite the\nlabel used to describe the identity. During the budget surplus years the government was able to retire\nsome of its outstanding debt, but the country also ran CA deficits implying, essentially, borrowings from\nforeigners. As in 2007, these years also describe periods in which foreign borrowings are used to maintain\na higher investment level than can be sustained with the lower national savings rate.\nIn contrast, consider the twin-deficit numbers calculated in the same way for China during the same\nperiod. The differences with the U.S. numbers are striking. The two things that stand out immediately are\nthe significantly higher values for private saving and investment. Instead of numbers in the midteens in\nthe United States, China’s percentages are in the midforties to low fifties. Again, the savings terms are\ncalculated as residuals, so there may be some error there, but nonetheless it is clear that China both saves\nand invests about three times more than the United States as a percentage of GDP. Because it invests so\nmuch more, the implication from the national income identity is that China consumes much less than the\nUnited States as a percentage. Indeed, China’s consumption figures (not shown) are usually less than 50\npercent of GDP.\nIndeed, this is why China and many other Asian economies are described as high-saving and low-\nconsuming countries. The United States in comparison is described as a high-consumption country and\nlow-saving country.\nThe negative number on China’s CA deficit in all the years means that China has run a trade surplus. A\nsurplus means it is lending money abroad and forgoing consumption, by another 11 percent in 2007. (This\nwill be explained in more detail in Chapter 3 \"The Whole Truth about Trade Imbalances\".) Also, the\nnegative number for China’s budget balance means that it was running a government budget surplus in\n2007. So in 2007, China had twin surpluses—a much rarer occurrence—rather than twin deficits. In\nprevious years China didn’t have twin anything: running trade surpluses that were increasing through the\npast decade, and government budget deficits.\nIt is worth reflecting briefly on the large investment and trade surpluses in China in comparison with the\nUnited States. The U.S. per capita GDP is about $47,000. Comprising that per person production is about\n15 percent that goes into investment. That still leaves a considerable percentage left for the consumption\nand government spending that enhance Americans’ standard of living. In contrast, China’s per capita\n\nGDP, in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, is about $6,000. Per person, it produces much less than in\nthe United States. But curiously, despite being a much poorer country, the high investment rate means\nthat it consumes and spends on government programs a much smaller percentage of its income than the\nUnited States; perhaps as little as $3,000 per person.\nThis seems to fly in the face of simple logic. One might expect that a richer country like the United States\nwould save more and consume less since it can do so while still maintaining a high standard of living. For\na poorer country like China, we might expect it would save less and try to consume a larger proportion of\nits income in order to catch up (i.e., in terms of its standard of living) with the rest of the world. Instead, it\nis the exact opposite.",

          "content": "holdings of foreign assets by domestic residents and the total holdings of domestic assets by foreign\nresidents at a point in time. In the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) financial statistics, these are\nlisted as domestic assets (foreign assets held by domestic residents) and domestic liabilities (domestic\nassets owned by foreign residents). The financial account balance, whose counterpart is the current\naccount balance, is more like an income statement that shows the changes in asset holdings during the\npast year. In other words, the financial account balance consists of flow variables since it records changes\nin the country’s asset holdings during the year, while the international asset position of a country consists\nof stock variables since it records the total value of assets at a point in time.\nA country’s net international asset position may be in surplus, deficit, or balance. If in surplus, then the\nvalue of foreign assets (debt and equity) held by domestic residents exceeds the value of domestic assets\nheld by foreigners. Alternatively, we could say that domestic assets exceed domestic liabilities. This\ncountry would then be referred to as acreditor country. If the reverse is true, so that domestic liabilities to\nforeigners exceed domestic assets, then the country would be called a debtor country.\nAsset holdings may consist of either debt obligations or equity claims. Debt consists of IOUs (i.e., I owe\nyou) in which two parties sign a contract agreeing to an initial transfer of money from the lender to the\nborrower followed by a repayment according to an agreed schedule. The debt contract establishes an\nobligation for the borrower to repay principal and interest in the future. Equity claims represent\nownership shares in potentially productive assets. Equity holdings do not establish obligations between\nparties, at least not in the form of guaranteed repayments. Once ownership in an asset is transferred from\nseller to buyer, all advantages and disadvantages of the asset are transferred as well.\nDebt and equity obligations always pose several risks. The first risk with debt obligations is the risk of\npossible default (either total or partial). To the lender, default risk means that the IOU will not be repaid\nat all, that it will be repaid only in part, or that it is repaid over a much longer period of time than\noriginally contracted. The risk of default to the borrower is that future borrowing will likely become\n\nunavailable. The advantage of default to the borrower, of course, is that not all the borrowed money is\nrepaid. The second risk posed by debt is that the real value of the repayments may be different than\nexpected. This can arise because of unexpected inflation or unexpected currency changes. Consider\ninflation first. If inflation is higher than expected, then the real value of debt repayment (if the nominal\ninterest rate is fixed) will be lower than originally expected. This will be an advantage to the borrower,\nwho repays less in real terms, and a disadvantage to the lender, who receives less in real terms. If inflation\nturns out to be less than expected, then the advantages are reversed. Next, consider currency fluctuations.\nSuppose a domestic resident, who receives income in the domestic currency, borrows foreign currency in\nthe international market. If the domestic currency depreciates, then the value of the repayments in\ndomestic currency terms will rise even though the foreign currency repayment value remains the same.\nThus currency depreciations can be harmful to borrowers of foreign currency. A similar problem can arise\nfor a lender. Suppose a domestic resident purchases foreign currency and then lends it to a foreign\nresident (note that this is the equivalent of saving money abroad). If the domestic currency appreciates,\nthen foreign savings, once cashed in, will purchase fewer domestic goods and the lender will lose.\nThe risk of equity purchases arises whenever the asset’s rate of return is less than expected. This can\nhappen for a number of different reasons. First, if the equity purchases are direct investment in a\nbusiness, then the return on that investment will depend on how well the business performs. If the market\nis vibrant and management is good, then the investment will be profitable. Otherwise, the rate of return\non the investment could be negative. All the risk, however, is borne by the investor. The same holds true\nfor stock purchases. Returns on stocks may be positive or negative, but it is the purchaser who bears full\nresponsibility for the return on the investment. Equity purchases can suffer from exchange rate risk as\nwell. When foreign equities are purchased, their rate of return in terms of domestic currency will depend\non the currency value. If the foreign currency in which assets are denominated falls substantially in value,\nthen the value of those assets falls along with it.\nThe U.S. International Investment Position\nThe United States is the largest debtor nation in the world. This means that its international investment\nposition is in deficit and the monetary value of that deficit is larger than that of any other country in the\nworld. The data for the U.S. international investment position in 2008 are available in this U.S. BEA\ninternational investment position spreadsheet. [1] At market values the preliminary estimate for 2008 is\n\nthat the U.S. was in debt to the rest of the world in the amount of $3.469 trillion. (Refer to cell I22 in\nspreadsheet.) Excluding financial derivatives that refer to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, the\nUnited States was in debt in the amount −$3.628 trillion (cell I24).\nNote that this valuation is the U.S. “net” investment position, meaning that it is the difference between the\nsum total value of foreign assets owned by U.S. residents (U.S. assets abroad) minus U.S. assets owned by\nforeigners (foreign-owned assets in the United States). The first of these, U.S. assets abroad, represents\nour purchases of foreign equities and money we have lent to foreigners. The total value stood at $19.888\ntrillion in 2008 using market value methods (cell I26). The second, foreign-owned assets in the United\nStates, represents foreign purchases of U.S. equities and money foreigners have lent to us or, equivalently,\nthat we have borrowed. The total in 2008 stood at $23.357 trillion (cell I50).\nThe size of the U.S. debt position causes worry for some. Thirty years ago the United States had a sizable\ncreditor position. However, as a result of trade deficits run throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the United\nStates quickly turned from a net creditor to a net debtor. The changeover occurred in 1989. In the early\n1990s, the size of this debt position was not too large compared to the size of the economy; however, by\nthe late 1990s and early 2000s, the debt ballooned. In 2008, the U.S. debt position stood at 24.6 percent\nof GDP, which interestingly is down slightly from 24.9 percent of GDP in 2002 despite annual current\naccount deficits since then. The reason for these changes is changes in the valuations of assets, as reflected\nin stock market prices, real estate price changes, and changes in the exchange rate.\nNotice in the 2008 BEA IIP spreadsheet that the investment position is derived from the 2007 position in\nthe following way. First, the current account deficit caused an addition to U.S. external debt of $505\nbillion (cell D22). Changes in asset prices both here and abroad further increased U.S. external debt by\n$720 billion (cell E22). This could be because either real estate prices abroad fell by more than in the\nUnited States or security prices abroad fell by more than in the United States. Next, there was another\nincrease of $583 billion in external U.S. debt because of changes in exchange rates. In this case, an\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar increased the values of foreign-held U.S. assets and reduced the value of\nU.S.-held foreign assets. Finally, U.S. external debt decreased by $479 billion due to other factors that\ndon’t neatly fit into the first two categories. (See footnote 2 in the BEA IIP spreadsheet.)\nFor several reasons, the debt is not a cause for great worry, although it is growing quickly. First, despite its\nlarge numerical size, the U.S. international debt position is still less than 25 percent of its annual GDP.\n\nAlthough this is large enough to be worrisome, especially with a trend toward a future increase, it is not\nnearly as large as some other countries have experienced in the past. In Argentina and Brazil,\ninternational debt positions exceeded 60 percent of their GDPs. For some less-developed countries,\ninternational debt at times has exceeded 100 percent of their annual GDP.\nA second important point is that much of our international obligations are denominated in our own home\ncurrency. This means that when international debts (principal + interest) are paid to foreigners, they will\nbe paid in U.S. currency rather than foreign currency. This relieves the U.S. from the requirement to sell\nproducts abroad to acquire sufficient foreign currency to repay its debts. Many other countries that have\nexperienced international debt crises have had great problems financing interest and principal\nrepayments especially when bad economic times make it difficult to maintain foreign sales.\nFinally, it is worth noting that, despite the name applied to it, our international “debt” position does not\ncorrespond entirely to “debt” in the term’s common usage. Recall that debt commonly refers to\nobligations that must be repaid with interest in the future. Although a sizable share of our outstanding\nobligations is in the form of debt, another component is in equities. That means some of the money\n“owed” to foreigners is simply the value of their shares of stock in U.S. companies. These equities either\nwill make money or will not be based on the success of the business, but they do not require a formal\nobligation for repayment in the future.",

Good or bad for whom, one might ask? Well, for the entire\ncountry.\nThe presence of a trade deficit, or an increase in the trade deficit in a previous month or quarter, is\ncommonly reported as a sign of distress. Similarly, a decrease in a trade deficit, or the presence of or\nincrease in a trade surplus, is commonly viewed as a sign of strength in an economy.\nUnfortunately, these perceptions and beliefs are somewhat misguided. In general, it is simply not true\nthat a trade deficit is a sign of a weak economy and a trade surplus is a sign of a strong economy. Merely\nknowing that a country has a trade deficit, or that a trade deficit is rising, is not enough information to say\nanything about the current or future prospects for a country—and yet that is precisely how the statistics\nare often reported.\nThe truth about trade deficits is that sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad, but most times,\nthey are benign (i.e., they just don’t matter).

There are other situations in which trade deficits could\nbe indicative of economic problems. In most situations, however, trade deficits are not large enough to\nwarrant a positive or negative interpretation. In this case, they should be viewed without interest. These\nsame points apply to trade surpluses as well.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explain, clearly and intuitively, the circumstances in which trade\nimbalances should be interpreted as good and the circumstances in which they are bad. The section will\nshow situations in which trade deficits can indeed lead to long-term harm for an economy. However, it\nwill also show cases in which trade deficits significantly improve a country’s long-term economic\nprospects. We will highlight cases in which trade surpluses are appropriate and a sign of strength for a\ncountry, and we will show other cases in which trade surpluses may correspond to current demise or even\nan eventual collapse of an economy.\n\nMost important, one should realize after reading this chapter that merely knowing that a country has a\ntrade deficit or surplus is not enough information to say anything substantive about the strength of a\ncountry or its economic prospects.",

          "content": "One of the main reasons trade deficits are considered deleterious is because of a common argument that\ntrade deficits result in job losses. The rationale behind this argument is simple and convincing. There are\ntwo parts to the story that begin with the definition of a trade deficit.\nFirst, a trade deficit arises whenever imports exceed exports. One simple reason for an imbalance of this\nkind is that imports are too large or at least larger than they would be under balanced trade. The most\ncommon reason offered in developed countries for why imports are too large is that low import prices\narise because less-developed countries have exceedingly low wages paid to workers, lax health and safety\nstandards, or more lenient environmental policies, all of which contribute to a veritable flood of imports.\nThe effect of excessive imports is said to be the purchase of cheaper foreign goods by domestic consumers\nrather than purchasing the slightly more expensive domestic varieties. As demand for domestic firms’\nproducts falls, these firms are forced to downsize, resulting in the layoff of domestic workers. Thus it is\nsaid that trade deficits cause the loss of domestic jobs.\nThe second story argues that the reason imports exceed exports is because exports are too low; they are\nsmaller than they should be. The most common reason given for low exports, especially in the developed\ncountries, is the relatively high barriers to trade in developing countries. Although many countries\nparticipate in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the average applied tariffs still remain considerably\nhigher in developing countries.\nThe effect of insufficient exports is that products that could be produced and sold abroad are not\nproduced and sold abroad because of the barriers to trade. If the barriers were only removed, then exports\nwould expand and jobs would be created in the country.\nThus since both of these stories can operate simultaneously, most observers are convinced that trade\ndeficits indeed will cause job losses. Turn the deficit around, perhaps so much so as to induce a trade\nsurplus, and this logic suggests that more jobs will be created.\nThis argument is very convincing because there is an element of truth to it. Changes in import and export\npatterns will certainly have competitive impacts on some industries and could produce temporary job\nlosses. However, this doesn’t mean that a country with a trade deficit generates fewer overall jobs than a\n\ncountry with a trade surplus. Nor does it mean that increases in a country’s trade deficit will necessarily\nlead to economy-wide job losses.\nOne reason job losses may not occur has to do with the deceptive nature of the previous job loss stories.\nThe stories are convincing as far as they go, but unfortunately, they don’t go far enough. In other words,\nthe job loss stories have some validity, but they are incomplete; they don’t tell the full story, and as a\nresult they tend to mislead.\nThe rest of the story (as Paul Harvey would have said) is to recognize that when trade deficits arise on the\ncurrent account, there is an equal and opposite trade surplus on the financial account of the balance of\npayments. A financial account surplus means that foreigners are purchasing domestic assets. Some of\nthese purchases consist of equities such as stocks and real estate, while other asset purchases involve the\nlending of money as when foreigners purchase a government bond. In any case, that money flows back\ninto the deficit country and ultimately is spent by someone. That someone could be the previous holder of\nthe real estate or it could be the domestic government. When it is spent, it creates demands for goods and\nservices that in turn create jobs in those industries.\nNow consider for a moment the following thought experiment. Suppose we could instantly change the\nbehavior of the foreign lenders generating the financial account surplus (and the related trade deficit).\nSuppose they decide at once not to lend the money to the government or not to purchase real estate but\ninstead decide to purchase domestic goods. The increase in goods purchases by foreigners would imply\nthat export demand and hence exports will rise. Indeed, they will rise sufficiently to eliminate the trade\ndeficit. And because of the increase in exports, jobs will be created in the export industries. However, at\nthe same time export jobs are created, other jobs in the economy are being lost. That’s because now less\nmoney is there to purchase the real estate or to lend to the government. Thus the elimination of the trade\ndeficit doesn’t create jobs in the aggregate, but it will change which sectors have more and less demand for\nits products. In other words, changes in the trade deficit will ultimately affect only where the jobs are in\nthe economy (i.e., in which industries), not how many jobs there are.\nThe one exception to this, and one of the main reasons the job loss stories remain so convincing, is when\nthere are rapid changes in the trade deficit or surplus. Rapid changes, like the thought experiment above,\nwould require adjustments of workers between industries. During that adjustment process, some workers\nwill be temporarily unemployed. If that adjustment involves an increase in the trade deficit or a decrease\n\nin the trade surplus, the temporary jobs effect will be very noticeable in the tradable products industries.\nHowever, if the adjustment involves a decrease in the deficit or an increase in the surplus, then the job\nlosses will more likely occur in the nontradable products sectors and it will be difficult to connect those\njob losses to the changes in the trade balance.\nTo provide some validation of this point—that is, that changes in the trade balances do not have effects on\nthe aggregate number of jobs in an economy—consider Figure 3.1 \"U.S. Trade Deficits and\nUnemployment, 1980–2009\", showing two U.S. macroeconomic variables plotted over the past twenty\nyears: the current account balance and the national unemployment rate. Now if the jobs stories suggesting\nthat trade deficits cause job losses were true, we might expect to see an inverse relationship between the\ntrade balance and the unemployment rate. Alternatively, if an increase in a country’s trade deficit causes\njob losses in the economy, we might expect an increase in the unemployment rate to occur as well.\nSimilarly, a decrease in the trade deficit should create jobs and lead to a decrease in the unemployment\nrate.\nInter\nFigure 3.1 U.S. Trade Deficits and Unemployment, 1980–2009\nesting\nly,\nwhat\nFigur\ne 3.1\n\"U.S.\nTrade\nDefici\nts and\nUne\nmplo\nyment, 1980–2009\"shows is that during the periods when the U.S. trade deficit is rising (i.e., the trade\nbalance is falling), the unemployment rate is falling; whereas when the trade deficit is falling, the\nunemployment rate is rising. This is precisely the opposite effect one would expect if the job-loss stories of\ntrade deficits were true.\n\nOf course this evidence does not prove that trade deficits will reduce unemployment in every country in all\ncircumstances. However, the evidence does suggest that it is inappropriate to jump to the popular",

          "content": "In this section, a series of simple scenarios (or stories) are presented to demonstrate how the well-being of\na country may be affected when it runs a trade imbalance. The scenarios compare national output with\ndomestic spending over two periods of time under alternative assumptions about the country’s trade\nimbalance and its economic growth rate between the two periods. After each aggregate scenario is\npresented, we also provide an analogous situation from the point of view of an individual. Finally we\npresent an evaluation of each scenario and indicate countries that may be displaying similar trade\npatterns.\nTwo periods are used as a simple way to introduce the dynamic characteristics of trade imbalances. The\namount of time between the two periods can be varied to provide alternative interpretations. Thus the two\nperiods could be labeled as today andtomorrow, this year and next year, or this generation and next\ngeneration.\nWe assume that all trade imbalances correspond to debt obligations or IOUs (i.e., I owe you). In other\nwords, the financial account imbalances that offset the trade imbalances will be interpreted as\ninternational borrowing and lending rather than, say, foreign direct investment flows or real estate\npurchases.\nAfterward, we will comment on how the interpretations of these scenarios may change with the\nalternative type of asset flow.\nNational welfare is best measured by the amount of goods and services that are “consumed” by\nhouseholds. What we care about, ultimately, is the standard of living obtainable by the average citizen,\nwhich is affected not by how much the nation produces but by how much it consumes.\nAlthough gross domestic product (GDP)is often used as a proxy for national welfare, it is an inadequate\nindicator for many reasons, especially when a country runs trade imbalances. To quickly see why,\nconsider the extreme situation in which a country runs the largest trade surplus possible. This would arise\nif a country exports all of its GDP and imports nothing. The country’s trade surplus would then equal its\n\nGDP, but the citizens in the country would have no food, clothing, or anything else to consume. The\nstandard of living would be nonexistent.\nTo avoid this problem we use domestic spending (DS), or the sum of domestic consumption, investment,\nand government spending, as a proxy for national welfare. More formally, let\nDS = C + I + G,\nwhere C, I, and G are defined as in the national income accounts. Recall from Chapter 2 \"National Income\nand the Balance of Payments Accounts\" that C, I, and G each can be segmented into spending on\ndomestically produced goods and services and spending on imported goods and services. Thus domestic\nspending includes imported goods in the measure of national welfare. This is appropriate since imported\ngoods are consumed by domestic citizens and add to their well-being and standard of living.\nOne problem with using domestic spending as a proxy for average living standards is the inclusion of\ninvestment (note that this problem would also arise using GDP as a proxy). Investment spending\nmeasures the value of goods and services used as inputs into the productive process. As such, these items\ndo not directly raise the well-being of citizens, at least not in the present period. To clarify this point,\nconsider an isolated, self-sufficient corn farmer. Each year the farmer harvests corn, using part of it to\nsustain the family during the year, while allocating some of the kernels to use as seed corn for the\nfollowing year. Clearly, the more kernels the farmer saves for next year’s crop, the less corn the family will\nhave to consume this year. As with the farmer, the same goes for the nation: the more that is invested\ntoday, the lower will be today’s standard of living, ceteris paribus. Thus we must use domestic spending\ncautiously as a measure of national welfare and take note of changes in investment spending if it occurs.\nThe analysis below will focus on the interpretation of differences between national income (GDP) and\ndomestic spending under different scenarios concerning the trade imbalance. The relationship between\nthem can be shown by rewriting the national income identity.\nThe national income identity is written as\nGDP = C + I + G + EX − IM.\nSubstituting the term for domestic spending yields\nGDP = DS + EX − IM,\nand rearranging it gives\nEX − IM = GDP − DS.\n\nThe last expression implies that when a country has a current account (or trade) surplus, GDP must\nexceed domestic spending by the equivalent amount. Similarly, when a country has a trade deficit,\ndomestic spending exceeds GDP.\nNote that to be completely accurate, we should use growth national product (GNP) rather than GDP in the\nanalysis. This is because we are interpreting EX − IM as the current account balance that includes income\npayments and receipts. With income flows included on the trade side, the measure of national output we\nget is GNP not GDP. Because conceptually both are measures of national output, we will use GNP in\neverthing that follows in this section.\nCase 1: No Trade Imbalances; No GNP Growth between Periods\nCase one, what we will call the base case, is used to demonstrate how GNP compares with domestic\nspending in the simplest\nFigure 3.2 Case 1\nscenario. Here we assume that the\ncountry does not run a trade\ndeficit or surplus in either of the\ntwo periods and that no GNP\ngrowth occurs between\nperiods. No trade imbalance\nimplies that no net\ninternational borrowing or\nlending occurs on the\nfinancial account. The case\nmimics how things would look if\nthe country were in autarky and\ndid not trade with the rest of the\nworld.\nNote from Figure 3.2 \"Case\n1\" that domestic spending is exactly equal to GNP in both periods. Since domestic spending is used to\nmeasure national welfare, we see that the average standard of living remains unchanged between the two\n\nperiods. Overall, nothing very interesting happens in this case, but it will be useful for comparison\npurposes.\nThe Individual Analogy\nConsider an individual named Rajiv. For an individual, GNP is analogous to Rajiv’s annual income since\nhis income represents the value of goods and services produced with his labor services. Domestic\nspending is analogous to the value of the goods and services purchased by Rajiv during the year. It\ncorresponds to Rajiv’s consumption of goods and services that serves as a proxy for his welfare level.\nTrade for an individual occurs whenever a transaction occurs with someone outside his household.\nLet’s assume for simplicity that Rajiv earns $30,000 per year. The assumption of no GNP growth in the\nbase case implies that he continues to earn $30,000 in the second period and thus experiences no income\ngrowth. The assumption of no trade imbalances implies that Rajiv engages in no borrowing or lending\noutside of his household. That implies that he spends all of his income on consumption goods and thus\npurchases $30,000 worth of goods and services. This level of consumption remains the same in both\nperiods, implying that his standard of living is unchanged.\nAnother way of interpreting balanced trade for an individual is to imagine that he exports $30,000 worth\nof labor services and afterward imports $30,000 worth of consumption goods and services. Since exports\nequal imports, trade is balanced.\nCase 2: Current Account Deficit Period 1; No GDP Growth between Periods\nIn this case, we assume that the country runs a current account (or trade) deficit in the first period. We’ll\nalso assume that the resultant financial account surplus corresponds to borrowing from the rest of the\nworld, rather than asset purchases. These borrowed funds are assumed to be repaid in their entirety in the\nsecond period. In other words, we’ll assume that loans are taken out in the first period and that the\nprincipal and interest are repaid completely in the second period. We also assume that there is no GNP\ngrowth between periods.\nAs shown in Figure 3.3 \"Case 2\", the trade deficit in the first period implies that domestic spending, DS,\n1\nexceeds GNP. The difference between DS and GNPrepresents the current account deficit as well as the\n1 1 1\nvalue of the outstanding principal on the foreign loans. The extra consumption the country can enjoy is\npossible because it borrows funds from abroad and uses them to purchase extra imports. The result is the\n\npotential for a higher standard of living in the country in the period in which it runs a current account\ndeficit if the extra funds are not directed into domestic investment.\nIn the second period, the borrowed\nFigure 3.3 Case 2\nfunds must be repaid with interest.\nThe repayment reduces domestic\nspending below the level of GNP by\nthe amount of the principal and\ninterest repayment as shown by the\nlight-colored areas in the\ndiagram. [1] Since GNP does not\nchange between the two\nperiods, DS will lie below GNP. What\n2 1\nthis means is that the average\nstandard of living can fall during the\nperiod in which the loan repayment is\nbeing made.\nThis outcome highlights perhaps the\nmost important concern about trade deficits. The fear is that large and persistent trade deficits may\nrequire a significant fall in living standards when the loans finally come due. If the periods are stretched\nbetween two generations, then there is an intergenerational concern. A country running large trade\ndeficits may raise living standards for the current generation, only to reduce them for the next generation.\nIt is then as if the parents’ consumption binge is being subsidized by their children.\nThe Individual Analogy\nIn case two, our individual, Rajiv, would again have a $30,000 income in two successive periods. In the\nfirst period, suppose Rajiv borrows money, perhaps by running up charges on his credit card. Suppose\nthese charges amount to $5,000 and that the interest rate is a generous 10 percent. Assuming Rajiv does\nnot save money in the first period, his consumption level in the first period would be the sum of his\nincome and his borrowed funds. Thus he would enjoy $35,000 worth of goods and services reflecting a\nstandard of living higher than his actual income.\n\nIn the second period, Rajiv must pay back the $5,000 in loans plus the interest charges, which, at a 10\npercent interest rate, would amount to $500. Thus $5,500 of Rajiv’s $30,000 income would go toward\ndebt repayment, leaving him with only $24,500 to spend on consumption.\nIn this case, extra consumption, or a higher living standard in period one, is achieved by sacrificing a\nlower living standard in the future.\nNote that in the first period Rajiv imports more goods and services in consumption than he exports in\nterms of labor services. Hence, this corresponds to a trade deficit. In the second period, Rajiv imports\nfewer goods and services in consumption than the labor services he exports; hence, this corresponds to a\ntrade surplus.\nEvaluation\nCase two reflects legitimate concerns about countries that run large or persistent trade deficits. The case\nhighlights the fact that trade deficits, which arise from international borrowing, may require a reduced\naverage standard of living for the country in the future when the loans must be repaid.\nAn example of this situation would be Mexico during the 1970s and 1980s. Mexico ran sizeable current\naccount deficits in the 1970s as it borrowed liberally in international markets.\nIn the early 1980s, higher interest rates reduced its ability to fulfill its obligations to repay principal and\ninterest on its outstanding loans. Their effective default precipitated the third world debt crisis of the\n1980s. During the 1980s, as arrangements were made for an orderly, though incomplete, repayment of\nMexico’s loans, the country ran sizeable current account surpluses. As in case two here, Mexico’s current\naccount deficits in the 1970s allowed it to raise its average living standards, above what would have been\npossible otherwise, while its current account surpluses in the 1980s forced a substantial reduction in\nliving standards.\nIt is worth emphasizing that current account deficits are not detrimental in the periods in which the\ndeficits are occurring. In fact, current account deficits correspond to higher consumption, investment, and\ngovernment spending levels than would be possible under balanced trade. Instead, current account\ndeficits pose a problem only when the debt repayment occurs, which is when the country is running\ncurrent account surpluses. Trade deficits raise national welfare in the periods in which they occur, while\ntrade surpluses reduce welfare in the periods in which they occur.\n\nIn other words, in terms of the national welfare effects, the problem here isn’t large or persistent trade\ndeficits but rather the large and persistent trade surpluses that might arise in the future as a result.\nIt is also worth noting that trade deficits in this case need not be a problem in the long run if they are not\ntoo large. Just as an individual may make a choice to substitute future consumption for present\nconsumption, so might a nation. For example, an individual may reasonably decide while young to take\nexotic vacations, engage in daredevilish activities, or maybe purchase a fast car, even if it means taking\nout sizeable loans. Better to enjoy life while healthy, he may reason, even if it means that he will have to\nforgo similar vacations or activities when he is older. Similarly, a nation, through an aggregation of similar\nindividual decisions, may “choose” to consume above its income today even though it requires reduced\nconsumption tomorrow. As long as the future reduced consumption “costs” are borne by the individuals\nwho choose to overconsume today, deficits for a nation need not be a problem. However, if the decision to\noverconsume is made through excessive government spending, then the burden of reduced consumption\ncould fall on the future generation of taxpayers, in which case there would be an intergenerational welfare\ntransfer.\nCase 3: Current Account Deficit Period 1; Positive GDP Growth between Periods\nIn the third case, we assume, as in case two, that the country runs a trade deficit in the first period, that\nthe trade deficit corresponds to borrowing from the rest of the world, and that in period two all the loans\nare repaid with interest. What differs here is that we will assume GNP growth occurs between the first and\nsecond periods. As we’ll see, growth can\nFigure 3.4 Case 3\nsignificantly affect the long-term\neffects of trade deficits.\nIn Figure 3.4 \"Case 3\", note that the first\nperiod domestic spending (DS) lies above\n1\nGNP in the first period (GNP). This arises\n1\nbecause a trade deficit implies that the\ncountry is borrowing from the rest of the\nworld, allowing it to spend (and\nconsume) more than it produces.\n\nIn the second period, we assume that GNP has grown to GNP as shown in the graph. The principal and\n2\ninterest from first period loans are repaid, which lowers domestic spending to DS. Note that since\n2\ndomestic spending is less than GNP, the country must be running a trade surplus. Also note that the\n2\ntrade surplus implies that consumption and the average standard of living are reduced below the level\nthat is obtainable with balanced trade in that period. In a sense, the trade deficit has a similar long-term\ndetrimental effect as in case two.\nHowever, it is possible that the first period trade deficit, in this case, may actually be generating a long-\nterm benefit. Suppose for a moment that this country’s balanced trade outcome over two periods would\nlook like the base case. In that case, balanced trade prevails but no GDP growth occurs, leaving the\ncountry with the same standard of living in both periods. Such a country may be able to achieve an\noutcome like case three if it borrows money from the rest of the world in period one—thus running a\ncurrent account deficit—and uses those funds to purchase investment goods, which may in turn stimulate\nGNP growth. If GNP rises sufficiently, the country will achieve a level of domestic spending that exceeds\nthe level that would have been obtained in the base case.\nIndeed, it is even possible for a country’s standard of living to be increased in the long term entirely\nbecause it runs a trade deficit. In case three, imagine that all the borrowed funds in period one are used\nfor investment. This means that even though domestic spending rises, the average standard of living\nwould remain unchanged relative to the base case because investment goods generate no immediate\nconsumption pleasures. In period two, the higher level of domestic spending may be used for increased\nconsumption that would cause an increase in the country’s average living standards. Thus the country is\nbetter off in both the short term and long term with the unbalanced trade scenario compared to the\nbalanced trade case.\nThe Individual Analogy\nThe third case is analogous to our individual Rajiv with, say, a $30,000 income in period one. The trade\ndeficit in the first period means that he borrows money using his credit card to purchase an additional,\nsay, $5,000 worth of “imported” consumption goods. Thus in period one the person’s consumption and\nstandard of living are higher than reflected by his income.\nIn the second period, the GNP rises, corresponding to an increase in Rajiv’s income. Let say that his\nincome rises to $40,000 in the second period. We’ll also assume that all credit card loans must be repaid\n\nalong with 10 percent interest charges in the second period. Consumption spending for Rajiv is now below\nhis income. Subtracting the $5,000 principal repayment and the $500 interest payment from his $40,000\nincome yields consumption of $34,500.\nThe investment story above is similar to the case in which an individual takes out $5,000 in student loans\nin period one and earns an advanced degree that allows him to acquire a better-paying job. Assuming the\neducational investment does not add to his consumption pleasures (a seemingly reasonable assumption\nfor many students), his welfare is unaffected by the additional spending that occurs in period one.\nHowever, his welfare is increased in period two since he is able to consume an additional $4,500 worth of\ngoods and services even after paying back the student loans with interest.\nEvaluation\nThe lesson of case three is that trade deficits, even if large or persistent, will not cause long-term harm to a\nnation’s average standard of living if the country grows rapidly enough. Rapid economic growth is often a\ncure-all for problems associated with trade deficits.\nIn some cases, it is possible for growth to be induced by investment spending made possible by borrowing\nmoney in international markets. A trade deficit that arises in this circumstance could represent economic\nsalvation for a country rather than a sign of economic weakness.\nConsider a less-developed country. Countries are classified as less developed because their average\nincomes are very low. Indeed, although many less-developed countries, or LDCs, have a small, wealthy\nupper class, most of the population lives in relative poverty. Individuals who are poor rarely save very\nmuch of their incomes, therefore, LDCs generally have relatively small pools of funds at home that can be\nused to finance domestic investment. If investment is necessary to fuel industrialization and economic\ngrowth, as is often the case especially in early stages of development, an LDC might be forced to a slow or\nnonexistent growth path if it restricts itself to balanced trade and limits its international borrowing.\nOn the other hand, if an LDC borrows money in international financial markets, it will run a trade deficit\nby default. If these borrowed funds are used for productive investment, which in turn stimulates sufficient\nGDP growth, then the country may be able to raise average living standards even after repaying the\n\nprincipal and interest on international loans. Thus trade deficits can be a good thing for less-developed\ncountries.\nThe same lesson can be applied to the economies in transition in the former Soviet bloc. These countries\nsuffered from a lack of infrastructure and a dilapidated industrial base after the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion. One obvious way to spur economic growth in the transition is to replace the capital stock with new\ninvestment: build new factories, install modern equipment, improve the roads, improve\ntelecommunications, and so on. However, with income falling rapidly after the collapse, there were few\ninternal sources to fund this replacement investment. It was also not obvious which sectors were the best\nto invest in. Nevertheless, one potential option was for these countries to borrow funds on international\nfinancial markets. Trade deficits that would occur under this scenario could be justified as an appropriate\nway to stimulate rapid economic growth.\nOf course, just because trade deficits can induce economic growth and generate long-term benefits for a\ncountry doesn’t mean that a trade deficit will spur long-term economic growth. Sometimes investments\nare made in inappropriate industries. Sometimes external shocks cause once profitable industries to\ncollapse. Sometimes borrowed international funds are squandered by government officials and used to\npurchase large estates and big cars. For many reasons good intentions, and good theory, do not always\nproduce good results. Thus a country that runs large and persistent trade deficits, hoping to produce the\nfavorable outcome shown in case three, might find itself with the unfavorable outcome shown in case two.\nFinally, a country running trade deficits could find itself with the favorable outcome even if it doesn’t use\nborrowed international funds to raise domestic investment. The United States, for example, has had\nrather large trade deficits since 1982. By the late 1980s, the United States achieved the status of the\nlargest debtor nation in the world. During the same period, domestic investment remained relatively low\nespecially in comparison to other developed nations in the world. One may quickly conclude that since\ninvestment was not noticeably increased during the period, the United States may be heading for the\ndetrimental outcome. However, the United States maintained steady GNP growth during the 1980s and\n1990s, except during the recession year in 1992. As long as growth proceeds rapidly enough, for whatever\nreason, even a country with persistent deficits can wind up with the beneficial outcome.\nCase 4: Current Account Surplus Period 1; No GDP Growth between Periods\n\nIn this case, we assume that the country runs a trade surplus in the first period and that no GDP growth\noccurs between periods. A surplus implies that exports exceed imports of goods and services and that the\ncountry has a financial account deficit. We will assume that the financial account deficit corresponds\nentirely to loans made to the rest of the world. We can also refer to these loans as savings, since the loans\nimply that someone in the country is forgoing current consumption. In the future, these savings will be\nredeemed along with the interest collected in the interim. We shall assume that all of these loans are\nrepaid to the country with interest in the second period.\nIn Figure 3.5 \"Case 4\", we see that in the first period, when the trade surplus is run, domestic spending\n(DS) is less than national income or GDP. This occurs because the country is lending rather than\n1\nconsuming some of the money available from production. The excess of exports over imports represents\ngoods that could have been used for domestic consumption, investment, and government spending but\nare instead being consumed by foreigners. This means that a current account surplus reduces a country’s\npotential for consumption and investment below what is achievable in balanced trade. If the trade surplus\nsubstitutes for domestic consumption and government spending, then the trade surplus will reduce the\ncountry’s average standard of living. If the trade surplus substitutes for domestic investment, average\nliving standards would not be affected, but the potential for future growth can be reduced. In this sense,\ntrade surpluses can be viewed as a sign of weakness for an economy, especially in the short run during the\nperiods when surpluses are run. Surpluses can reduce living standards and the potential for future\ngrowth.\nFigure 3.5 Case 4 Nevertheless, this does not mean that\ncountries should not run trade surpluses\nor that trade surpluses are necessarily\ndetrimental over a longer period. As\nshown in the diagram, when period two\narrives the country redeems its past\nloans with interest. This will force the\ncountry to run a trade deficit, and\ndomestic spending (DS) will exceed\n2\nGDP. The trade deficit implies imports\n\nexceed exports, and these additional imports can be used to raise domestic consumption, investment, and\ngovernment spending. If the deficit leads to greater consumption and government spending, then the\ncountry’s average standard of living will rise above what is achievable in balanced trade. If the deficit leads\nto greater investment, then the country’s potential for GDP growth in the third period (not shown) is\nenhanced.\nBriefly, this case describes the situation in which a country forgoes first period consumption and\ninvestment so that in period two it can enjoy even greater consumption and investment.\nThe Individual Analogy\nConsider our individual, Rajiv, who has an annual income of $30,000 over two periods. This corresponds\nto the constant GDP in the above example. Rajiv would run a trade surplus in period one if he lends\nmoney to others. One way to achieve this is simply to put money into a savings account in the local bank.\nSuppose Rajiv deposits $5,000 into a savings account. That money is then used by the bank to make loans\nto other individuals and businesses. Thus in essence Rajiv is making loans to them with the bank acting as\nan intermediary. The $5,000 also represents money that Rajiv does not use to buy goods and services.\nThus in period one Rajiv exports $30,000 of labor services, but imports only $25,000 of consumption\ngoods. The excess is loaned to others so that they may be consumed instead in the first period. It is clear\nthat Rajiv’s standard of living at $25,000 is lower in the first period than the $30,000 he could have\nachieved had he not deposited money into savings.\nIn the second period, we imagine that Rajiv again earns $30,000 and withdraws all the money plus\ninterest from the savings account. Suppose he had earned 10 percent interest between the periods. In this\ncase, his withdrawal would amount to $5,500. This means that in period two Rajiv can consume $35,500\nworth of goods and services. This outcome also implies that Rajiv’s domestic spending capability exceeds\nhis income and so he must be running a trade deficit. In this case, Rajiv’s imports of goods and services at\n$35,500 exceed his exports of $30,000 worth of labor services; thus he has a trade deficit.\nIs this outcome good or bad for Rajiv? Most would consider this a good outcome. One might argue that\nRajiv has prudently saved some of his income for a later time when he may have a greater need. The story\nmay seem even more prudent if Rajiv suffered a significant drop in income in the second period to, say,\n$20,000. In this case, the savings would allow Rajiv to maintain his consumption at nearly the same level\nin both periods despite the shock to his income stream. This corresponds to the words of wisdom that one\n\nshould save for a rainy day. Savings can certainly allow an individual to smooth his consumption stream\nover time.\nAlternatively, one might consider the two periods of the story to be middle age and retirement. In this\ncase, it would make sense to save money out of one’s income in middle age so that one can draw on those\nsavings and their accumulated earnings during retirement when one’s income has fallen to zero.\nOn the other hand, excessive saving in the first period might make Rajiv seem miserly. Few people would\nadvise that one save so much as to put oneself into poverty or to reduce one’s living standard below some\nreasonable norm. Excessive prudence can seem inappropriate as well.\nEvaluation\nThe prime example of a country that mimics the first period of case four is Japan during the 1980s and\n1990s. Japan ran sizeable trade surpluses during those two decades. As this story suggests, the flip side of\nthe trade surplus is a financial account deficit that implied a considerable increase in the amount of loans\nthat Japan made to the rest of the world. Although Japan’s trade surplus has often been touted as a sign of\nstrength, an important thing to keep in mind is that Japan’s trade surpluses implied lower consumption\nand government purchases, and thus a lower standard of living than would have been possible with\nbalanced trade. Although trade surpluses can also result in lower investment, this effect was not apparent\nfor Japan. During those two decades of investment, spending as a percentage of GDP always exceeded 25\npercent, higher than most other developed countries.\nThese surpluses may turn out to be especially advantageous for Japan as it progresses in the twenty-first\ncentury. First of all, it is clear that Japan’s surpluses did not usher in an era of continual and rapid GDP\ngrowth. By the early 1990s, Japan’s economy had become stagnant and finally began to contract by 1998.\nHowever, rather than allowing a decline in GDP to cause a reduction in living standards, Japan could use\nits sizeable external savings surplus to maintain consumption at the level achieved previously. Of course,\nthis would require that Japan increase its domestic consumption and begin to run a trade deficit, two\nthings that did not occur even by 2009.\nIn another respect, Japan’s trade surpluses may be advantageous over the longer run. Japan, along with\nmost other developed nations, will experience a dramatic demographic shift over the next three decades.\nIts retired population will continue to grow as a percentage of the total population of the baby boomers\nreach retirement and people continue to live longer. The size of the Japan’s working population will\n\nconsequently decline as a percentage of the population. This implies an increasing burden on Japan’s pay-\nas-you-go social retirement system as a smaller number of workers will be available per retiree to fund\nretiree benefits. If at that time Japan draws down its accumulated foreign savings and runs trade deficits,\nit will be able to boost the average consumption level of its population while reducing the need to raise tax\nburdens to fund its social programs. Of course, this outcome may never be realized if Japan’s economy\ndoes not rebound strongly from its recent stagnant condition.\nOverall, regardless of the outcome, Japan’s economy today, faced with a potentially severe recession, is\ncertainly in a stronger position by virtue of its accumulated foreign savings than it would be if it had run\ntrade deficits during the past two decades.",

          "content": "equity rather than debt.\nThe analysis of trade imbalances is further complicated by the fact that not all financial flows are debt\nobligations or IOUs (i.e., I owe you). In the previous stories, we assumed that all financial account\ntransactions corresponded to international lending or borrowing. In actuality, many international asset\ntransactions involve sales or purchases of productive assets. For example, if a foreigner purchases shares\nof Microsoft stock in the U.S. market, the transaction would be recorded as a credit entry on the financial\naccount and would add to a financial account surplus. However, in this case we could not claim that\nsomeone in the United States borrowed money from the rest of the world because there is no obligation to\nrepay principal and interest in the future. Instead the foreign purchaser of the U.S. asset has purchased an\nownership claim in a U.S. corporation that entitles him to the future stream of dividends plus capital gains\nif he sells the stock later at a higher price. If the company is profitable in the future, then the investors will\nearn a positive return. However, if the company suffers economic losses in the future, then the dividends\nmay be discontinued and the stock’s price may fall. Alternatively, the U.S. dollar could experience a\nsignificant depreciation. The end result could be losses for the foreign investor and a negative rate of\nreturn. In either case the foreign investor is not “entitled” to a return of his original investment or any\nadditional return beyond. This same type of relationship arises for international real estate transactions\nand for foreign direct investment, which occurs when a foreign firm substantially owns and operates a\ncompany in another country.\nTo the extent that financial account flows correspond to asset purchases without repayment obligations,\nthe stories above change somewhat. For example, suppose a country runs a trade deficit in period one and\nsuppose further that the resulting financial account surplus corresponds to foreign purchases of U.S. real\nestate and businesses. In the first period, a country’s standard of living could be raised above what is\npossible with balanced trade—not by borrowing money but by selling ownership claims on productive\nassets. In the second period, the country’s standard of living need not be reduced since there is no\nrepayment obligation.\n\nThis case is analogous to an individual who sells his watch at a pawnshop. In that period he is able to buy\nmore than his income because he has divested some of his previously accumulated wealth. In the\nfollowing period, he can once again make purchases equal to his income and thus need not suffer a\nreduction in his living standards.\nThe implication here is that nondebt asset flows may be less problematic than international loans because\nthey do not require a reduction in living standards in the future. Of course, in this case, there is an\nadditional concern that the country that sells off its assets may also be losing control of its productive\nassets and thus its citizens will not be the ones to earn positive returns on these domestic activities. This\nconcern should be tempered for a few reasons. First, foreign-owned firms remain subject to the laws of\nthe domestic country. Countries can prevent exorbitant profit taking by applying profit taxes. What’s\nmore, the foreign owners do not enjoy voting privileges and thus have less say over laws that might affect\nthem. Second, foreign-owned firms generate employment opportunities for domestic citizens, and that\nserves to benefit the country. Finally, owners of firms, whether foreign or domestic, are generally\nmotivated by similar desires—namely, to make the business successful— and successful businesses\ngenerally benefit the owners, the employees, and the consumers of the product.\nAs an example, consider the purchase in the 1980s of Rockefeller Center in New York City by a group of\nJapanese investors. Rockefeller Center is a centrally located building in New York City whose owners lease\noffice space to businesses that wish to locate their offices there. Any owner of the building must compete\nwith other businesses leasing office space throughout the city and thus must provide as high a quality and\nas low a price as possible. If the owners manage the property well and provide quality services, then they\nwill have a lot of tenants and they will make a profit. If they provide poor services, then businesses will\nmove out and the owners will lose money. Thus it really shouldn’t matter to the tenants whether the\nowners are American or Japanese, only whether they are good managers of the office space. Similarly, the\nowners, regardless of nationality, will hire workers to maintain the facilities. These workers will benefit if\nthe management is good and will suffer if it is poor, regardless of the owners’ nationality. Finally, if the\nowners of the building are successful, then they deserve to earn a profit or return on their investment. If\nthey provide poor services at high prices, then they will deserve to make a loss. Indeed, it shouldn’t matter\nto anyone whether the owners are American or Japanese nationals.",

          "content": "Review of Trade Imbalance Interpretations\nA quick reading of business and financial newspapers and magazines often reveals a number of\nmisunderstandings about economic relationships. One of the most notable is the widespread conviction\nthat trade deficits are a troubling economic condition that indicates weakness in an economy, while trade\nsurpluses are a sign of strength for an economy. Although these beliefs are well founded in some\ncircumstances, they are not valid as a general principle. A careful look at the implications of trade\nimbalances reveals that trade deficits can, at times, be an indicator of rising economic stature, while trade\nsurpluses can be associated with economic disaster. In many other cases, perhaps most, trade imbalances\nare simply benign—that is, they do not represent a serious threat or imply a notable benefit.\nThere are several reasons why misunderstandings about trade imbalances persist. The first problem\nrelates to the terminology. A deficit, regardless of the context, sounds bad. To say that a business’s books\nare in deficit, that a government’s budget is in deficit, or that a country’s trade balance is in deficit, simply\nsounds bad. A surplus, in contrast, sounds pretty good. For a business, clearly we’d prefer a surplus, to be\nin the black, to make a profit. Likewise, a budget surplus or a trade surplus must be good as well.\nLastly, balance seems either neutral or possibly the ideal condition worth striving for. From an\naccountant’s perspective, balance is often the goal. Debits must equal credits, and the books must balance.\nSurely, this terminology must contribute to the confusion, at least in a small way, but it is not accurate in\ndescribing trade imbalances in general.\nA second reason for misunderstandings, especially with regard to deficits, may be a sense of injustice or\ninequity because foreigners are unwilling to buy as many of our goods as we buy of theirs. Fairness would\nseem to require reciprocity in international exchanges and therefore balanced trade. This\nmisunderstanding could be easily corrected if only observers were aware that a country’s balance of\npayments, which includes trade in goods, services, and assets, is always in balance. There are no unequal\nexchanges even when a country runs a trade deficit.\nA third reason for the misunderstanding is that trade deficits are indeed bad for some countries in some\nsituations while surpluses are sometimes associated with good economic outcomes. One needs only to\n\nnote the many international debt crises experienced by countries after they had run persistent and very\nlarge trade deficits. One could also look at the very high growth rates of Japan in the 1980s and China in\nthe last few decades for examples of countries with large trade surpluses that have seemingly fared very\nwell.\nHowever, despite these examples, one should not conclude that any country that has a trade deficit or\nwhose trade deficit is rising is necessarily in a potentially dangerous situation; nor should we think that\njust because a country has a trade surplus that it is necessarily economically healthy. To see why, we must\nrecognize that trade imbalances represent more than just an imbalance in goods and services trade.\nAny imbalance in goods and services trade implies an equal and opposite imbalance in asset trade. When\na country runs a trade deficit (more exhaustively labeled a current account deficit), it is also running a\nfinancial account surplus; similarly, a trade surplus corresponds to a financial account deficit. Imbalances\non the financial account mean that a country is a net seller of international assets (if a financial account\nsurplus) or a net buyer of international assets (if a financial account deficit).\nOne way to distinguish among good, bad, or benign trade imbalances is to recognize the circumstances in\nwhich it is good, bad, or benign to be a net international borrower or lender, a net purchaser, or seller of\nownership shares in businesses and properties.\nThe International Investment Position\nAn evaluation of a country’s trade imbalance should begin by identifying the country’s net international\nasset or investment position. The investment position is like a balance sheet in that it shows the total\nholdings of foreign assets by domestic residents and the total holdings of domestic assets by foreign\nresidents at a point in time. In the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) financial statistics, these are\nlisted as domestic assets (foreign assets held by domestic residents) and domestic liabilities (domestic\nassets owned by foreign residents). In contrast, the financial account balance is more like an income\nstatement that shows the changes in asset holdings during the past year. In other words, the international\nasset position of a country consists of stock variables while the financial account balance consists of flow\nvariables.\nA country’s net international investment balance may either be in a debtor position, a creditor position, or\nin balance. If in a creditor position, then the value of foreign assets (debt and equity) held by domestic\nresidents exceeds the value of domestic assets held by foreigners. Alternatively, we could say that\n\ndomestic assets exceed domestic liabilities. If the reverse is true, so that domestic liabilities to foreigners\nexceed domestic assets, then the country would be called a debtor nation.\nAsset holdings may consist of either debt obligations or equity claims. Debt consists of IOUs in which two\nparties sign a contract agreeing to an initial transfer of money from the lender to the borrower followed by\na repayment according to an agreed schedule. The debt contract establishes an obligation for the borrower\nto repay principal and interest in the future. Equity claims represent ownership shares in potentially\nproductive assets. Equity holdings do not establish obligations between parties, at least not in the form of\nguaranteed repayments. Once ownership in an asset is transferred from seller to buyer, all advantages and\ndisadvantages of the asset are transferred as well.\nDebt and equity obligations always pose several risks. The first risk with debt obligations is the risk of\npossible default (either total or partial). To the lender, default risk means that the IOU will not be repaid\nat all, that it will be repaid only in part, or that it is repaid over a much longer period than originally\ncontracted. To the borrower, the risk of default is that future borrowing will likely become unavailable. In\ncontrast, the advantage of default to the borrower is that not all the borrowed money is repaid.\nThe second risk posed by debt is that the real value of the repayments may be different than expected.\nThis can arise because of unexpected inflation or unexpected currency value changes. Consider inflation\nfirst. If inflation is higher than expected, then the real value of debt repayment (if the nominal interest\nrate is fixed) will be lower than originally expected. This will be an advantage to the borrower (debtor),\nwho repays less in real terms, and a disadvantage to the lender (creditor), who receives less in real terms.\nIf inflation turns out to be less than expected, then the advantages are reversed.\nNext, consider currency fluctuations. Suppose a domestic resident, who receives income in the domestic\ncurrency, borrows foreign currency in the international market. If the domestic currency depreciates, then\nthe value of the repayments in domestic currency terms will rise even though the foreign currency\nrepayment value remains the same. Thus currency depreciations can be harmful to borrowers of foreign\ncurrency. A similar problem can arise for a lender. Suppose a domestic resident purchases foreign\ncurrency and then lends it to a foreign resident (note in this case the domestic resident is saving money\nabroad). Afterward, if the domestic currency appreciates, then foreign savings, once cashed in, will\npurchase fewer domestic goods and the lender will lose.\n\nSimilarly, various risks arise with equity purchases internationally because the asset’s rate of return may\nturn out to be less than expected. This can happen for a number of different reasons. First, if the equity\npurchases are direct investment in a business, then the return on that investment will depend on how well\nthe business performs. If the market is vibrant and management is good, then the investment will be\nprofitable. Otherwise, the rate of return on the investment could be negative; the foreign investor could\nlose money. In this case, all the risk is borne by the investor, however. The same holds for stock\npurchases. Returns on stocks may be positive or negative, but it is the purchaser who bears full\nresponsibility for the return on the investment. As with debt, equity purchases can suffer from exchange\nrate risk as well. When foreign equities are purchased, their rate of return in terms of domestic currency\nwill depend on the currency value. If the foreign currency in which assets are denominated falls\nsubstantially in value, then the value of those assets falls along with it.\nFour Trade Imbalance Scenarios\nThere are four possible situations that a country might face. It may be\n1. a debtor nation with a trade deficit,\n2. a debtor nation with a trade surplus,\n3. a creditor nation with a trade deficit,\n4. a creditor nation with a trade surplus.\nFigure 3.6 \"International Asset Positions\" depicts a range of possible international investment positions.\nOn the far left of the image, a country would be a net debtor nation, while on the far right, it would be a\nnet creditor nation. A trade deficit or surplus run in a particular year will cause a change in the nation’s\nasset position assuming there are no capital gains or losses on net foreign investments. A trade deficit\nwould generally cause a leftward movement in the nation’s investment position implying either a\nreduction in its net creditor position or an increase in its net debtor position. A trade surplus would cause\na rightward shift in a country’s investment position implying either an increase in its net creditor position\nor a decrease in its net debtor position.\nAn exception to this rule occurs whenever there are changes in the market value of foreign assets and\nwhen\nFigure 3.6 International Asset Positions\nthe\ninvestm\n\nent position is calculated using current market values rather than original cost. For example, suppose a\ncountry has balanced trade in a particular year and is a net creditor nation. If the investment position is\nevaluated using original cost, then since the current account is balanced, there would be no change in the\ninvestment position. However, if the investment position is evaluated at current market values, then the\nposition can change even with balanced trade. In this case, changes in the investment position arise due to\ncapital gains or losses. Real estate or property valuations may change, portfolio investments in stock\nmarkets may rise or fall, and currency value changes may also affect the values of national assets and\nliabilities.\nThe pros and cons of a national trade imbalance will depend on which of the four situations describes the\ncurrent condition of the country. We’ll consider each case in turn next.\nCase 1: Net Debtor Nation Running a Current Account Deficit\nThis is perhaps the most common situation in the world, or at least this type of case gets the most\nattention. The main reason is that large trade deficits run persistently by countries, which are also large\ndebtor nations, can eventually be unsustainable. Examples of international debt crises are widespread.\nThey include the third world debt crisis of the early 1980s, the Mexican crisis in 1994, and the Asian crisis\nin 1997.\nHowever, not all trade deficits nor all debtor countries face eventual default or severe economic\nadjustment. Indeed, for some countries, a net debtor position with current account deficits may be an\nideal economic situation. To distinguish the good cases from the bad requires us to think about situations\nin which debt is good or bad.\nAs mentioned earlier, a current account deficit means that a country is able to spend more on goods and\nservices than it produces during the year. The additional spending can result in increases in consumption,\ninvestment, and/or government spending. The country accomplishes this as a net debtor country by\nborrowing from the rest of the world (incurring debt), or by selling some of its productive assets\n(equities).\nLet’s consider a few scenarios.\nFirst, suppose the current account deficit is financed by borrowing money from the rest of the world (i.e.,\nincurring debt). Suppose the additional spending over income is on consumption and government goods\nand services. In this case, the advantage of the deficit is that the country is able to consume more private\n\nand public goods while it is running the deficit. This would enhance the nation’s average standard of living\nduring the period the deficit is being run. The disadvantage is that the loans that finance the increase in\nthe standard of living must be repaid in the future. During the repayment period, the country would run a\ncurrent account surplus, resulting in national spending below national income. This might require a\nreduction in the country’s average standard of living in the future.\nThis scenario is less worrisome if the choices are being made by private citizens. In this case, individuals\nare freely choosing to trade off future consumption for current consumption. However, if the additional\nspending is primarily on government goods and services, then it will be the nation’s taxpayers who will be\nforced to repay government debt in the future by reducing their average living standards. In other words,\nthe future taxpayers’ well-being will be reduced to pay for the extra benefits accruing to today’s taxpayers.\nPossible reductions in future living standards can be mitigated or eliminated if the economy grows\nsufficiently fast. If national income is high enough in the future, then average living standards could still\nrise even after subtracting repayment of principal and interest. Thus trade deficits are less worrisome\nwhen both current and future economic growth are more rapid.\nOne way to stimulate economic growth is by increasing spending on domestic investment. If the borrowed\nfunds that result when a country runs a current account deficit are used for investment rather than\nconsumption or if the government spending is on infrastructure, education, or other types of human and\nphysical capital, then the prospects for economic growth are enhanced.\nIndeed, for many less-developed countries and countries in transition from a socialist to capitalist market,\ncurrent account deficits represent potential salvation rather than a curse. Most poor countries suffer from\nlow national savings rates (due to low income) and inadequate tax collection systems. One obvious way to\nfinance investment in these countries is by borrowing from developed countries that have much higher\nnational savings rates. As long as the investments prove to be effective, much more rapid economic\ngrowth may be possible.\nThus trade deficits for transitional and less-developed economies are not necessarily worrisome and may\neven be a sign of strength if they are accompanied by rising domestic investment and/or rising\ngovernment expenditures on infrastructure.\nThe main problem with trade deficits arises when they result in a very large international debt position.\n(Arguably, one could claim that international debt greater than 50 percent of GDP is very large.) In this\n\ncircumstance, it can lead to a crisis in the form of a default on international obligations. However, the\ninternational debt position figures include both debt and equities, and only the debt can be defaulted on.\nEquities, or ownership shares, may yield positive or negative returns but do not represent the same type\nof contractual obligations. A country would never be forced to repay foreign security holders for its losses\nsimply because its value on the market dropped. Thus a proper evaluation of the potential for default\nshould only look at the net international “debt” position after excluding the net position on equities.\nDefault becomes more likely the larger the external debt relative to the countries’ ability to repay. Ability\nto repay can be measured in several ways. First, one can look at net debt relative to GDP. Since it\nmeasures annual national income, GDP represents the size of the pool from which repayment of principal\nand interest is drawn—the larger the pool, the greater the ability of the country to repay. Alternatively, the\nlower the country’s net debt to GDP ratio, the greater the country’s ability to repay.\nA second method to evaluate ability to repay is to consider net debt as a percentage of exports of goods\nand services. This is especially relevant when international debt is denominated in foreign currencies. In\nthis case, the primary method to acquire foreign currencies to make repayment of debt is through the\nexport of goods and services. (The alternative method is to sell domestic assets.) Thus the potential for\ndefault may rise if the country’s ratio of net external debt to exports is larger.\nNotice, though, that the variable to look at to evaluate the risk of default is the net debt position, not the\ntrade deficit. The trade deficit merely reveals the change in the net debt position during the past year and\ndoes not record total outstanding obligations. In addition, a trade deficit can be run even while the net\n“debt” position falls. This could occur if the trade deficit is financed primarily with net equity sales rather\nthan net debt obligations. Thus the trade deficit, by itself, does not reveal a complete picture regarding the\npotential for default.\nNext, we should consider what problems are associated with default. Interestingly, it is not really default\nitself that is immediately problematic but the actions taken to avoid default. If default on international\ndebt does occur, international relationships with creditor countries would generally suffer. Foreign banks\nthat are not repaid on past loans will be reluctant to provide loans in the future. For a less-developed\ncountry that needs foreign loans to finance productive investment, these funds may be cut off for a long\nperiod and thus negatively affect the country’s prospects for economic growth. On the positive side,\ndefault is a benefit for the defaulting country in the short-run since it means that borrowed funds are not\n\nrepaid. Thus the country enjoys the benefits of greater spending during the previous periods when trade\ndeficits are run but does not have to suffer the consequences of debt repayment. With regard to the\ncountry’s international debt position, default would cause an immediate discrete reduction in the\ncountry’s debt position.\nThe real problem arises when economic shocks suddenly raise external obligations on principal and\ninterest, making a debt that was once sustainable suddenly unsustainable. In these cases, it is the effort\nmade to avoid default that is the true source of the problem.\nInability to repay foreign debt arises either if the value of payments suddenly increases or if the income\nused to finance those payments suddenly falls. Currency depreciations are a common way in which the\nvalue of repayments can suddenly rise. If foreign debt is denominated in foreign currency, then domestic\ncurrency depreciation implies an appreciation in the value of external debt. If the currency depreciation is\nlarge enough, a country may become suddenly unable to make interest and principal repayments. Note,\nhowever, that if external debt were denominated in domestic currency, then the depreciation would have\nno effect on the value of interest and principal repayments. This implies that countries with large external\ndebts are in greater danger of default if (1) their currency value is highly volatile and (2) the external debt\nis largely denominated in foreign currency.\nA second way in which foreign interest obligations can suddenly rise is if the obligations have variable\ninterest rates and if the interest rates suddenly rise. This was one of the problems faced by third world\ncountries during the debt crisis in the early 1980s. Loans received from the U.S. and European banks\ncarried variable interest rates to reduce the risk to the banks from unexpected inflation. When restrictive\nmonetary policy in the United States pushed up U.S. interest rates, interest obligations by foreign\ncountries also suddenly rose. Thus international debt with variable interest rates potentially raises the\nlikelihood of default.\nDefault can also occur if a country’s ability to repay suddenly falls. This can occur if the country enters\ninto a recession. Recessions imply falling GDP, which reduces the pool of funds available for repayment. If\nthe recession is induced by a reduction in exports, perhaps because of recessions in major trading partner\ncountries, then the ability to finance foreign interest and principal repayments is reduced. Thus a\nrecession in the midst of a large international debt position can risk potential default on international\nobligations.\n\nBut what are the problems associated with a sudden increase in debt repayment if default on the debt\ndoes not occur? The problem, really, is that the country might suddenly have to begin running current\naccount surpluses to maintain repayments of its international obligations. Remember that trade deficits\nmean that the country can spend more than its income. By itself, that’s a good thing. Current account\nsurpluses, though, mean that the country must spend less than its income. That’s the bad thing, especially\nif it occurs in the face of an economic recession.\nIndeed, this is one of the problems the U.S. economy is facing in the midst of the current recession. As the\nU.S. GDP began to fall in the fall of 2008, the U.S. trade deficit also fell. For the “trade deficits are bad”\nfolks, this would seem to be a good thing. However, it really indicated that not only was U.S. production\nfalling but, because its trade deficit was also falling, its consumption was falling even faster. In terms of\nstandard of living, the drop in the U.S. trade deficit implied a worsening of the economic conditions of its\ncitizens.\nHowever, since this problem arises only when a net debtor country runs a current account surplus, we’ll\ntake up this case in the next section. Note well though that the problems associated with a trade deficit\nrun by a net debtor country are generally not visible during the period in which the trade deficit is run. It\nis more likely that a large international debt will pose problems in the future if or when substantial\nrepayment begins.\nIn summary, the problem of trade deficits run by a net debtor country is more worrisome\n1. the larger the net debtor position,\n2. the larger the net debt (rather than equity) position,\n3. the larger the CA deficit (greater than 5 percent of GDP is large according to some, although large deficit\nwith small net debtor position is less worrisome),\n4. the more net debt is government obligations or government backed,\n5. the larger the government deficit,\n6. if a high percentage of debt is denominated in foreign currency and if the exchange rate has or will\ndepreciate substantially,\n7. if rising net debt precedes slower GDP growth,\n8. if rising net debt correlates with falling investment,\n\n9. if deficits correspond to “excessive” increase in (C + G) per capita (especially if G is not capital\ninvestment),\n10. if interest rate on external debt is variable,\n11. if a large recession is imminent.\nThe situation is benign or beneficial if the reverse occurs.\nCase 2: Net Debtor Nation Running a Current Account Surplus\nThis case generally corresponds to a country in the process of repaying past debt. Alternatively, foreigners\nmay be divesting themselves of domestic equity assets (i.e., selling previously purchased equities, like\nstocks and real estate, back to domestic residents). In either case, the trade surplus will reduce the\ncountry’s net debtor position and will require that domestic spending is less than national income. This\ncase is especially problematic if it arises because currency depreciation has forced a sudden change in the\ncountry’s required repayments on international debt. This is the outcome when a series of trade deficits\nproves to be unsustainable. What unsustainability means is that the deficits can no longer be continued.\nOnce external financing is no longer available, the country would not have the option to roll over past\nobligations. In this case, in the absence of default, the country’s net repayment on current debt would rise\nand push the financial account into deficit and hence the trade account into surplus.\nWhen this turnaround occurs rapidly, the country suddenly changes from a state in which it spends more\non consumption, investment, and government than its income to a state in which it spends less on these\nitems than its income. Even if GDP stayed the same, the country would suffer severe reductions in its\nstandard of living and reductions in its investment spending. The rapid reduction in domestic demands is\ngenerally sufficient to plunge the economy into a recession as well. This reduction in GDP further\nexacerbates the problem.\nThis problematic outcome is made worse nationally when most of the debt repayment obligations are by\nthe domestic government or if the external obligations are government-backed. A government that must\nsuddenly make larger than expected repayments of debt must finance it either by raising taxes or by\nreducing government benefits. The burden of the repayment is then borne by the general population\nbecause it must all come from taxpayers. Exactly who suffers more or less will depend on the nature of the\nbudget adjustments, although it often seems that poorer segments of the population bear the brunt of the\nadjustment costs.\n\nIf the sudden increase in debt repayment were primarily by private firms, then the burdens would fall on\nthe associates of those firms rather than the general population. If this occurs on a small scale, we can\nview this as normal adjustments in a free market system: some firms always go bust, forcing dislocations\nof labor and capital. The general population in this case would not bear the burden of adjustment unless\nthey are affiliated with the affected firms.\nHowever, even if the debt repayment burden is private and even if the government had not previously\nguaranteed that debt, the government may feel compelled to intervene with assistance if many private\nfirms are negatively affected. This will perhaps be even more likely if the affected private debt is held by\nmajor national banks. Default by enough banks can threaten the integrity of the banking system.\nGovernment intervention to save the banks would mean that the general population would essentially\nbear the burdens of private mistakes.\nThis kind of rapid reversal is precisely what happened to Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and South Korea\nin the aftermath of the Asian currency crisis in 1997. Afterward, these countries recorded substantial\ncurrent account surpluses. These surpluses should not be viewed as a sign of strong vibrant economies;\nrather, they reflect countries that are in the midst of recessions, struggling to repay their past obligations,\nand that are now suffering a reduction in average living standards as a consequence.\nThe most severe consequences of a current account surplus as described above arise when the change\nfrom trade deficit to surplus is abrupt. If, on the other hand, the transition is smooth and gradual, then\nthe economy may not suffer noticeably at all. For example, consider a country that has financed a period\nof extra spending on infrastructure and private investment by running trade deficits and has become a net\ninternational debtor nation. However, once the investments begin to take off, fueling rapid economic\ngrowth, the country begins to repay more past debt than the new debt that it incurs each period. In this\ncase, the country could make a smooth transition from a trade deficit to a trade surplus. As long as GDP\ngrowth continued sufficiently fast, the nation might not even need to suffer reductions in its average living\nstandards even though it is spending less than its income during the repayment period.\nIn summary, the situation of a net debtor nation running current account surpluses is more worrisome if\n1. surpluses follow default,\n2. GDP growth rate is low or negative,\n3. the investment rate is low or falling,\n\n4. real C + G per capita is falling,\n5. surplus corresponds to rising net debt and larger equity sales.\nThe situation is benign or beneficial if the reverse occurs.\nCase 3: Net Creditor Nation Running a Current Account Surplus\nA net creditor country with trade surpluses is channeling savings to the rest of the world either through\nlending or through the purchase of foreign productive assets. The situation is generally viewed as prudent\nbut may have some unpleasant consequences. Recall that a country with a trade surplus is spending less\non consumption, investment, and government combined than its national income. The excess is being\nsaved abroad. Net creditor status means that the country has more total savings abroad than foreigners\nhave in their country.\nThe first problem may arise if the surplus corresponds to the substitution of foreign investment for\ndomestic investment. In an era of relatively free capital mobility, countries may decide that the rate of\nreturn is higher and the risk is lower on foreign investments compared to domestic investments. If\ndomestic investment falls as a result, future growth prospects for the country are reduced as well. This\nsituation has been a problem in Russia and other transition economies. As these economies increased\ntheir private ownership of assets, a small number of people became extremely wealthy. In a well-\nfunctioning economy with good future business prospects, wealth is often invested internally helping to\nfuel domestic growth. However, in many transition economies, wealth holders decided that it was too\nrisky to invest domestically because uncertainty about future growth potential was very low. So instead,\nthey saved their money abroad, essentially financing investment in much healthier and less risky\neconomies.\nChina is another creditor country running a trade surplus today. It is, however, in a different situation\nthan Russia or the transition economies in the 1990s. China’s internal investment rate is very high and its\ngrowth rate has been phenomenal over the past twenty years or more. The fact that it has a trade surplus\nmeans that as a nation it is saving even more than necessary to finance its already high investment levels.\nThe excess it is lending abroad, thereby raising its international creditor position. (SeeChapter 1\n\"Introductory Finance Issues: Current Patterns, Past History, and International Institutions\" for more\ndetails.) If it was to redirect that saving domestically, it may not be able to fuel additional growth since\ntheir investment spending is already so high. Their trade surplus also means that its average standard of\n\nliving is well below what is possible because it is saving the surplus abroad rather than spending it on\nconsumption or government goods at home.\nA second problem arises even if domestic investment remains high. With domestic investment kept high,\nthe cost of the large surpluses must be felt as a reduction in consumption and government spending. In\nthis case, a large trade surplus leads to a reduction in average living standards for the country. This is a\npoint worth emphasizing. Countries that run trade surpluses suffer a reduction in living standards, not an\nincrease, relative to the case of balanced trade.\nAnother potential problem with being a net creditor country is the risk associated with international\nlending and asset purchases. First of all, foreign direct investments may not pay off as hoped or expected.\nPortfolio investments in foreign stock markets can suddenly be reduced in value if the foreign stock\nmarket crashes. On international loans, foreign nations may default on all or part of the outstanding\nloans, may defer payments, or may be forced to reschedule payments. This is a more likely event if the\noutstanding loans are to foreign countries with national external debts that may prove unsustainable. If\nthe foreign country suffers rapid currency depreciation and if the foreign loans are denominated in\ndomestic currency, then the foreign country may be forced to default. Defaults may also occur if the\nforeign debtor countries suffer severe recessions. The creditor nation in these cases is the one that must\nsuffer the losses.\nIt was this situation that was especially serious for the United States at the onset of the third world debt\ncrisis in the early 1980s. At that time, a number of large U.S. banks had a considerable proportion of their\nasset portfolios as loans to third world countries. Had these countries defaulted en masse, it would have\nthreatened the solvency of these banks and could have led to a serious banking crisis in the U.S. economy.\nAlternatively, suppose the surplus country has made external loans in the foreign countries’ currency. If\nthe foreign currency depreciates, even if only gradually, then the value of the foreign assets falls in terms\nof the domestic currency. The realized rates of return on these assets could then become negative, falling\nfar short of returns on comparable domestic assets.\nThis is the dilemma that China faces today. The Chinese government has accumulated almost $1 trillion of\nU.S. Treasury bonds as a result of its persistent current account surpluses over the past decade. All of this\ndebt is denominated in U.S. dollars, making it subject to exchange rate risk. If the Chinese relent to U.S.\npressure to allow their fixed currency value appreciate to the U.S. dollar, then the value of these U.S.\n\nassets falls in value and reduces their future returns. The Chinese are also worried about the potential for\nfuture U.S. inflation due to the expansionary monetary policy used during the current economic crisis. If\ninflation does arise in the future, the value of the trillion dollars of foreign debt would also be reduced.\nThis situation is epitomized with a popular parable that says, “If you owe me a thousand dollars,\nthen you have a problem, but if you owe me a million dollars, then I have a problem.” Even though the\nUnited States is the debtor and the Chinese the creditor, the Chinese now have a problem because they\nmay have lent too much to the United States.\nIn summary, the situation of a net creditor nation running current account surpluses is worrisome if the\n1. net credit position is very large,\n2. current account surplus is very large,\n3. GDP growth rate is low,\n4. investment rate is low or falling,\n5. C + G per capita is low or falling,\n6. surplus involves lending denominated in a foreign currency that may afterward depreciate,\n7. domestic currency has appreciated substantially,\n8. foreign asset values have fallen substantially.\nThe situation is benign or beneficial if the reverse occurs.\nCase 4: Net Creditor Nation Running a Current Account Deficit\nIn general, a deficit run by a country that is a net creditor is least likely to be problematic. Essentially, this\ndescribes a country that is drawing down previously accumulated savings. The deficit also implies that the\ncountry is spending more than its income. This situation is especially good if it allows the country to\nmaintain living standards during a recession. This case would also be good if a country with a rapidly\naging population is drawing down previous savings to maintain average living standards.\nThe current account deficit can cause problems if as in case one, the deficit corresponds to falling\ninvestment and increases in consumption and government expenditures. If these changes occur while the\neconomy continues to grow, then it may indicate potential problems for future economic growth.\nHowever, if the same changes occur while the economy is in a recession, then the effect would be to\nmaintain average living standards by drawing down external savings. If this occurs only during the\nrecession, then the long-term effect on growth would be mitigated.\n\nThis case can be a problem if the net creditor position is extremely large. A large amount of foreign\nsavings can always potentially drop in value given currency fluctuations as described above in case three.\nHowever, the current account deficit only serves to reduce this potential problem since it reduces the\ncountry’s net creditor position.\nIn summary, the situation of a net creditor nation running current account deficits is worrisome if\n1. the net creditor status is smaller and the deficit is larger (although this is generally less worrisome than if\nthe country were a net debtor),\n2. investment is falling (although a temporary drop in investment is likely in a recession),\n3. C + G per capita is rising rapidly.\nThe situation is benign or beneficial if the reverse occurs.",

          "content": "The foreign exchange market (Forex) is not a market like the New York Stock Exchange, where daily\ntrades of stock are conducted in a central location. Instead, the Forex refers to the activities of major\ninternational banks that engage in currency trading. These banks act as intermediaries between the true\nbuyers and sellers of currencies (i.e., governments, businesses, and individuals). These banks will hold\nforeign currency deposits and stand ready to exchange these for domestic currency upon demand. The\nexchange rate (ER) will be determined independently by each bank but will essentially be determined by\nsupply and demand in the market. In other words, the bank sets the exchange rate at each moment to\nequalize its supply of foreign currency with the market demand. Each bank makes money by collecting a\ntransactions fee for its “exchange services.”\nIt is useful to categorize two distinct groups of participants in the Forex, those whose transactions are\nrecorded on the current account (importers and exporters) and those whose transactions are recorded on\nthe financial account (investors).\nImporters and Exporters\nAnyone who imports or exports goods and services will need to exchange currencies to make the\ntransactions. This includes tourists who travel abroad; their transactions would appear as services in the\ncurrent account. These businesses and individuals will engage in currency trades daily; however, these\ntransactions are small in comparison to those made by investors.\nInternational Investors, Banks, Arbitrageurs, and Others\nMost of the daily currencies transactions are made by investors. These investors, be they investment\ncompanies, insurance companies, banks, or others, are making currency transactions to realize a greater\nreturn on their investments or holdings. Many of these companies are responsible for managing the\nsavings of others. Pension plans and mutual funds buy and sell billions of dollars worth of assets daily.\nBanks, in the temporary possession of the deposits of others, do the same. Insurance companies manage\nlarge portfolios that act as their capital to be used to pay off claims on accidents, casualties, and deaths.\nMore and more of these companies look internationally to make the most of their investments.\n\nIt is estimated by the Bank of International Settlements that over $3 trillion (or $3,000 billion) worth of\ncurrency is traded every day. Only about $60 to $100 billion of trade in goods and services takes place\ndaily worldwide. This suggests that many of the currency exchanges are done by international investors\nrather than importers and exporters.\nInvestment Objectives\nInvestors generally have three broad concerns when an investment is made. They care about how much\nmoney the investment will earn over time, they care about how risky the investment is, and they care\nabout how liquid, or convertible, the asset is.\n1. Rate of return (RoR). The percentage change in the value of an asset over some period.\nInvestors purchase assets as a way of saving for the future. Anytime an asset is purchased, the purchaser\nis forgoing current consumption for future consumption. To make such a transaction worthwhile the\ninvestors hope (sometimes expect) to have more money for future consumption than the amount they give\nup in the present. Thus investors would like to have as high a rate of return on their investments as\npossible.\nExample 1: Suppose a Picasso painting is purchased in 1996 for $500,000. One year later, the painting is\nresold for $600,000. The rate of return is calculated as:\n[(600,000 – 500,000))/ 500,000] x 100 = (100,000/500,000) x 100 = 0.20 x 100 = 20%\nExample 2: $1,000 is placed in a savings account for one year at an annual interest rate of 10 percent.\nThe interest earned after one year is $1,000 × 0.10 = $100. Thus the value of the account after one year is\n$1,100. The rate of return is:\n(1100 – 1000 / 1000) x 100 = (100/1000) x 100 = 0.10 x 100 = 10%\nThis means that the rate of return on a domestic interest-bearing account is merely the interest rate.\n2. Risk. The second primary concern of investors is the riskiness of the assets. Generally, the greater the\nexpected rate of return, the greater the risk. Invest in an oil wildcat endeavor and you might get a 1,000\npercent return on your investment—that is, if you strike oil. The chances of doing so are likely to be very\nlow, however. Thus a key concern of investors is how to manage the trade-off between risk and return.\n3. Liquidity. Liquidity essentially means the speed with which assets can be converted to cash. Insurance\ncompanies need to have assets that are fairly liquid in the event that they need to pay out a large number\n\nof claims. Banks also need to be able to make payouts to their depositors, who may request their money\nback at any time.",

          "content": "Anyone who has ever traveled to another country has probably had to deal with an exchange rate between\ntwo currencies. (I say “probably” because a person who travels from, say, Italy to Spain continues to use\neuros.) In a sense, exchange rates are very simple. However, despite their simplicity they never fail to\ngenerate confusion. To overcome that confusion this chapter begins by offering straightforward\ndefinitions and several rules of thumb that can help with these problems.\nThe exchange rate (ER) represents the number of units of one currency that exchanges for a unit of\nanother. There are two ways to express an exchange rate between two currencies (e.g., between the U.S.\ndollar [$] and the British pound [£]). One can either write $/£ or £/$. These are reciprocals of each other.\nThus if E is the $/£ exchange rate and V is the £/$ exchange rate, then E = 1/V.\nFor example, on January 6, 2010, the following exchange rates prevailed:\nE = 1.59, which implies V = 0.63,\n$/£ £/$\nand\nV = 92.7, which implies E = 0.0108.\n¥/$ $/¥\nCurrency Value\nIt is important to note that the value of a currency is always given in terms of another currency. Thus the\nvalue of a U.S. dollar in terms of British pounds is the £/$ exchange rate. The value of the Japanese yen in\nterms of dollar is the $/¥ exchange rate.\nNote that we always express the value of all items in terms of something else. Thus the value of a quart of\nmilk is given in dollars, not in quarts of milk. The value of car is also given in dollar terms, not in terms of\ncars. Similarly, the value of a dollar is given in terms of something else, usually another currency. Hence,\nthe rupee/dollar exchange rate gives us the value of the dollar in terms of rupees.\nThis definition is especially useful to remember when one is dealing with unfamiliar currencies. Thus the\nvalue of the euro (€) in terms of British pounds is given as the £/€ exchange rate.\nSimilarly, the peso/euro exchange rate refers to the value of the euro in terms of pesos.\nCurrency appreciation means that a currency appreciates with respect to another when its value rises in\nterms of the other. The dollar appreciates with respect to the yen if the ¥/$ exchange rate rises.\n\nCurrency depreciation, on the other hand, means that a currency depreciates with respect to another\nwhen its value falls in terms of the other. The dollar depreciates with respect to the yen if the ¥/$\nexchange rate falls.\nNote that if the ¥/$ rate rises, then its reciprocal, the $/¥ rate, falls. Since the $/¥ rate represents the\nvalue of the yen in terms of dollars, this means that when the dollar appreciates with respect to the yen,\nthe yen must depreciate with respect to the dollar.\nThe rate of appreciation (or depreciation) is the percentage change in the value of a currency over some\nperiod.\nExample 1: U.S. dollar (US$) to the Canadian dollar (C$)\nOn January 6, 2010, EC US = 1.03.\n$/ $\nOn January 6, 2009, EC US = 1.19.\n$/ $\nUse the percentage change formula, (new value − old value)/old value:\n(1.03-1.19)/1.19 = -0.16 / 1.19 = -0.134\nMultiply by 100 to write as a percentage to get\n−0.134 × 100 = −13.4%.\nSince we have calculated the change in the value of the U.S. dollar in terms of Canadian dollar, and since\nthe percentage change is negative, this means that the dollar has depreciated by 13.4 percent with respect\nto the C$ during the previous year.\nExample 2: U.S. dollar ($) to the Pakistani rupee (R)\nOn January 6, 2010, E = 84.7.\nR/$\nOn January 6, 2010, E = 79.1.\nR/$\nUse the percentage change formula, (new value − old value)/old value:\n(84.7 – 79.1) / 79.1 = +5.6 / 79.1 = +0.071\nMultiply by 100 to write as a percentage to get\n+0.071 × 100 = +7.1%.\nSince we have calculated the change in the value of the U.S. dollar, in terms of rupees, and since the\npercentage change is positive, this means that the dollar has appreciated by 7.1 percent with respect to the\nPakistani rupee during the past year.\n\nOther Exchange Rate Terms\nArbitrage generally means buying a product when its price is low and then reselling it after its price rises\nin order to make a profit. Currency arbitrage means buying a currency in one market (e.g., New York) at a\nlow price and reselling, moments later, in another market (e.g., London) at a higher price.\nThe spot exchange rate refers to the exchange rate that prevails on the spot, that is, for trades to take place\nimmediately. (Technically, it is for trades that occur within two days.)\nThe forward exchange rate refers to the rate that appears on a contract to exchange currencies either 30,\n60, 90, or 180 days in the future.\nFor example, a corporation might sign a contract with a bank to buy euros for U.S. dollars sixty days from\nnow at a predetermined ER. The predetermined rate is called the sixty-day forward rate. Forward\ncontracts can be used to reduce exchange rate risk.\nFor example, suppose an importer of BMWs is expecting a shipment in sixty days. Suppose that upon\narrival the importer must pay €1,000,000 and the current spot ER is 1.20 $/€.\nThus if the payment were made today it would cost $1,200,000. Suppose further that the importer is\nfearful of a U.S. dollar depreciation. He doesn’t currently have the $1,200,000 but expects to earn more\nthan enough in sales over the next two months. If the U.S. dollar falls in value to, say, 1.30 $/€ within\nsixty days, how much would it cost the importer in dollars to purchase the BMW shipment?\nThe shipment would still cost €1,000,000. To find out how much this is in dollars, multiply €1,000,000\nby 1.30 $/€ to get $1,300,000.\nNote that this is $100,000 more for the cars simply because the U.S. dollar value changed.\nOne way the importer could protect himself against this potential loss is to purchase a forward contract to\nbuy euros for U.S. dollars in sixty days. The ER on the forward contract will likely be different from the\ncurrent spot ER. In part, its value will reflect market expectations about the degree to which currency\nvalues will change in the next two months. Suppose the current sixty-day forward ER is 1.25 $/€,\nreflecting the expectation that the U.S. dollar value will fall. If the importer purchases a sixty-day contract\nto buy €1,000,000, it will cost him $1,250,000 (i.e., $1,000,000 × 1.25 $/€). Although this is higher than\nwhat it would cost if the exchange were made today, the importer does not have the cash available to make\nthe trade today, and the forward contract would protect the importer from an even greater U.S. dollar\ndepreciation.\n\nWhen the forward ER is such that a forward trade costs more than a spot trade today costs, there is said to\nbe a forward premium. If the reverse were true, such that the forward trade were cheaper than a spot\ntrade, then there is a forward discount.\nA currency trader is hedging if he or she enters into a forward contract to protect oneself from a downside\nloss. However, by hedging the trader also forfeits the potential for an upside gain. Suppose in the story\nabove that the spot ER falls rather than rises. Suppose the ER fell to 1.10 $/€. In this case, had the\nimporter waited, the €1,000,000 would only have cost $1,100,000 (i.e., $1,000,000 × 1.10 $/€). Thus\nhedging protects against loss but at the same time eliminates potential unexpected gain.",

          "content": "Suppose that an investor holding U.S. dollars must decide between two investments of equal risk and\nliquidity. Suppose one potential investment is a one-yearcertificate of deposit (CD) issued by a U.S. bank\nwhile a second potential investment is a one-year CD issued by a British bank. For simplicity we’ll assume\nthat interest is calculated on both CDs using a simple interest rather than with a compounding formula. A\nCD is a type of deposit that provides a higher rate of interest to the depositor in return for a promise to\nkeep the money deposited for a fixed amount of time. The time period could be six months, one year, two\nyears, or any other period decided by the bank. If the depositor wants to withdraw the money earlier, she\nmust pay a penalty.\nSince we imagine that an investor wants to obtain the highest rate of return (RoR) possible, given\nacceptable risk and liquidity characteristics, that investor will choose the investment with the highest rate\nof return. If the investor acted naively, she might simply compare interest rates between the two\ninvestments and choose the one that is higher. However, this would not necessarily be the best choice. To\nsee why, we need to walk through the calculation of rates of return on these two investments.\nFirst, we need to collect some data, which we will do in general terms rather than use specific values.\nExamples with actual values are presented in a later section.\nLet E = the spot ER.E e = the expected ER one year from now.i = the one-year interest rate on a CD\n$/£ $/£ $\nin the United States (in decimal form).i = the one-year interest rate on a CD in Britain (in decimal form).\n£\nU.S. Rate of Return\nThe rate of return on the U.S. CD is simply the interest rate on that deposit. More formally,\nRoR = i .\n$ $\nThis is because the interest rate describes the percentage increase in the value of the deposit over the\ncourse of the year. It is also simple because there is no need to convert currencies.\nBritish Rate of Return\nThe rate of return on the British CD is more difficult to determine. If a U.S. investor, with dollars, wants to\ninvest in the British CD, she must first exchange dollars for pounds on the spot market and then use the\nBritish pound (£) to purchase the British CD. After one year, she must convert pounds back to dollars at\n\nthe exchange rate that prevails then. The rate of return on that investment is the percentage change in\ndollar value during the year. To calculate this we can follow the procedure below.\nSuppose the investor has P dollars to invest (P for principal).\nStep 1: Convert the dollars to pounds.\nP/ E\n$/£\nis the number of pounds the investor will have at the beginning of the year.\nStep 2: Purchase the British CD and earn interest in pounds during the year.\n(P/ E )(1+i )\n$/£ £\nis the number of pounds the investor will have at the end of the year. The first term in parentheses returns\nthe principal. The second term is the interest payment.\nStep 3: Convert the principal plus interest back into dollars in one year.\n(P/E ) (1+i ) Ee\n$/£ £ $/£\nis the number of dollars the investor can expect to have at the end of the year.\nThe rate of return in dollar terms from this British investment can be found by calculating the expected\npercentage change in the value of the investor’s dollar assets over the year, as shown below:\nRoR = P/ E (1+i ) Ee −P\n£ $/£ £ $/£\nP\nAfter factoring out the P, this reduces to\nRoR = Ee (1+i )−1\n£ $/£ £\nE\n$/£\nThus the rate of return on the foreign investment is more complicated because the set of transactions is\nmore complicated. For the U.S. investment, the depositor simply deposits the dollars and earns dollar\ninterest at the rate given by the interest rate. However, for the foreign deposit, the investor must first\nconvert currency, then deposit the money abroad earning interest in foreign currency units, and finally\nreconvert the currency back to dollars. The rate of return depends not only on the foreign interest rate but\nalso on the spot exchange rate and the expected exchange rate one year in the future.\nNote that according to the formula, the rate of return on the foreign deposit is positively related to\nchanges in the foreign interest rate and the expected foreign currency value and negatively related to the\nspot foreign currency value.",

          "content": "The rate of return works out to be negative, which means that instead of making money on the foreign\ndeposit, this investor actually loses $317. Had he deposited the $10,000 in a U.S. account, he would have\nhad a guaranteed return of 1.90 percent, earning him $190 instead.\nBy depositing in a foreign account, the depositor subjected himself to exchange rate risk. The dollar\nunexpectedly appreciated during the year, resulting in a loss. Had the dollar remain fixed in value during\nthat same time, the foreign return would have been 2.25 percent, which is larger than that obtained in the\nUnited States.\nThus fluctuating exchange rates make it more difficult for investors to know the best place to invest. One\ncannot merely look at what the interest rate is across countries but must also speculate about the\nexchange rate change. Make the wrong guess about the exchange rate movement and one could lose a\nsubstantial amount of money.\nThere are some ways to hedge against exchange rate risk. For example, with short-term deposits, an\ninvestor can purchase a forward contract or enter a futures market. In these cases, the investor would\narrange to sell Danish krone in the future when the deposit is expected to be converted back to dollars.\nSince the future exchange rate is predetermined on such a contract, the rate of return is guaranteed as\nwell. Thus the risk of floating exchange rates can be reduced. However, for long-term investment such as\nforeign direct investment, these types of arrangements are more difficult and costly to implement.\nVolatility and the Choice of Exchange Rate System\nOn the face of it, floating exchange rates would appear to be riskier than fixed rates since they are free to\nchange regularly. For this reason, countries may choose fixed exchange rates to reduce volatility and thus\nto encourage international trade and investment.\n\nThe problem with this perception is that it has not worked out this way in practice. A 2004 International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) study [1] notes that on average, during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the volatility of\nfixed exchange rates was approximately the same as that of floating rates. There are two reasons this can\noccur. First, a currency fixed to another reserve currency will continue to float against other currencies.\nThus when China pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar, it continued to float with the dollar vis-à-vis the\neuro. Second, it is common for fixed currencies to be devalued or revalued periodically, sometimes\ndramatically. When this happens, the effects of volatility are concentrated in a very short time frame and\ncan have much larger economic impacts.\nThe second thing noted by this study is that volatility had only a small effect on bilateral international\ntrade flows, suggesting that the choice of exchange rate system on trade flows may be insignificant.\nHowever, the study does not consider the effects of volatility on international investment decisions. Other\nstudies do show a negative relationship between exchange rate volatility and foreign direct investment.\nBut if these results were true and fixed exchange rates are just as volatile as floating rates, then there is no\nobvious exchange system “winner” in terms of the effects on volatility. Nevertheless, volatility of exchange\nrate systems remains something to worry about and consider in the choice of exchange rate systems.",

          "content": "Interest rate parity (IRP) is a theory used to explain the value and movements of exchange rates. It is also\nknown as the asset approach to exchange rate determination. The interest rate parity theory assumes that\nthe actions of international investors—motivated by cross-country differences in rates of return on\ncomparable assets—induce changes in the spot exchange rate. In another vein, IRP suggests that\ntransactions on a country’s financial account affect the value of the exchange rate on the foreign exchange\n(Forex) market. This contrasts with the purchasing power parity theory, which assumes that the actions of\nimporters and exporters, whose transactions are recorded on the current account, induce changes in the\nexchange rate.\nInterest Rate Parity Condition\nInterest rate parity refers to a condition of equality between the rates of return on comparable assets\nbetween two countries. The term is somewhat of a misnomer on the basis of how it is being described\nhere, as it should really be called rate of return parity. The term developed in an era when the world was\nin a system of fixed exchange rates. Under those circumstances, and as will be demonstrated in a later\nchapter, rate of return parity did mean the equalization of interest rates. However, when exchange rates\ncan fluctuate, interest rate parity becomes rate of return parity, but the name was never changed.\nIn terms of the rates of return formulas developed in Chapter 4 \"Foreign Exchange Markets and Rates of\nReturn\", interest rate parity holds when the rate of return on dollar deposits is just equal to the expected\nrate of return on British deposits, that is, when RoR = RoR .\n$ £\nPlugging in the above formula yields\ni = i + (1+i ) Ee −E\n$ £ £ $/£ $/£\nE\n$/£\nThis condition is often simplified in many textbooks by dropping the final term in which the British\ninterest rate is multiplied by the exchange rate change. The logic is that the final term is usually very small\nespecially when interest rates are low. The approximate version of the IRP condition then is\n\ni −i = Ee −E\n$ £ $/£ $/£\nE\n$/£\nOne should be careful, however. The approximate version would not be a good approximation when\ninterest rates in a country are high. For example, back in 1997, short-term interest rates were 60 percent\nper year in Russia and 75 percent per year in Turkey. With these interest rates, the approximate formula\nwould not give an accurate representation of rates of return.\nInterest Rate Parity Theory\nInvestor behavior in asset markets that results in interest parity can also explain why the exchange rate\nmay rise and fall in response to market changes. In other words, interest parity can be used to develop a\nmodel of exchange rate determination. This is known as the asset approach, or the interest rate parity\nmodel.\nThe first step is to reinterpret the rate of return calculations described previously in more general\n(aggregate) terms. Thus instead of using the interest rate on a one-year certificate of deposit (CD), we will\ninterpret the interest rates in the two countries as the average interest rates that currently prevail.\nSimilarly, we will imagine that the expected exchange rate is the average expectation across many\ndifferent individual investors. The rates of return then are the average expected rates of return on a wide\nvariety of assets between two countries.\nFigure 5.1 The Forex for British Pounds\nNext, we imagine that investors trade currencies\nin the foreign exchange (Forex) market. Each\nday, some investors come to a market ready to\nsupply a currency in exchange for another, while\nothers come to demand currency in exchange for\nanother.\nConsider the market for British pounds (£) in\nNew York depicted in Figure 5.1 \"The Forex for\nBritish Pounds\". We measure the supply and\ndemand of pounds along the horizontal axis and\nthe price of pounds (i.e., the exchange rate E )\n$/£\non the vertical axis. Let S represent the supply\n£\n\nof pounds in exchange for dollars at all different exchange rates that might prevail. The supply is generally\nby British investors who demand dollars to purchase dollar denominated assets. However, supply of\npounds might also come from U.S. investors who decide to convert previously acquired pound currency.\nLet D the demand for pounds in exchange for dollars at all different exchange rates that might prevail.\n£\nThe demand is generally by U.S. investors who supply dollars to purchase pound-denominated assets. Of\ncourse, demand may also come from British investors who decide to convert previously purchased dollars.\nRecall that\nRoR = i + (1+i£) Ee −E ,\n£ £ $/£ $/£\nE\n$/£\nwhich implies that as E rises, RoR falls. This means that British investors would seek to supply more\n$/£ £\npounds at higher pound values but U.S. investors would demand fewer pounds at higher pound values.\nThis explains why the supply curve slopes upward and the demand curve slopes downward.\nThe intersection of supply and demand specifies the equilibrium exchange rate (E) and the quantity of\n1\npounds (Q) traded in the market. When the Forex is at equilibrium, it must be that interest rate parity is\n1\nsatisfied. This is true because the violation of interest rate parity will cause investors to shift funds from\none country to another, thereby causing a change in the exchange rate. This process is described in more\ndetail in Chapter 5 \"Interest Rate Parity\", Section 5.2 \"Comparative Statics in the IRP Theory\".",

          "content": "investment decisions and affect the exchange rate value.\nComparative statics refers to an exercise in a model that assesses how changes in an exogenous variable\nwill affect the values of the endogenous variables. The endogenous variables are those whose values are\ndetermined in the equilibrium. In the IRP model, the endogenous variables are the exchange rate value\nand—of lesser importance—the quantity of currencies exchanged on the Forex market. The exogenous\nvariables are those whose values are given beforehand and are known by the model’s decision makers. In\nthe IRP model, the exogenous variables are those that influence the positions of the rate of return curves,\nincluding the U.S. interest rate, the British interest rate, and the expected future exchange rate. Another\nway to describe this is that the endogenous variable values are determined within the model, while the\nexogenous variable values are determined outside of the model.\nComparative statics exercises enable one to answer a question like “What would happen to the exchange\nrate if there were an increase in U.S. interest rates?” When assessing a question like this, economists will\ninvariably invoke the ceteris paribus assumption. Ceteris paribus means that we assume all other\nexogenous variables are maintained at their original values when we change the variable of interest. Thus\nif we assess what would happen to the exchange rate (an endogenous variable) if there were an increase in\nthe U.S. interest rate (an exogenous variable) while invoking ceteris paribus, then ceteris paribus means\nkeeping the original values for the other exogenous variables (in this case, the British interest rate and the\nexpected future exchange rate) fixed.\nIt is useful to think of a comparative statics exercise as a controlled economic experiment. In the sciences,\none can test propositions by controlling the environment of a physical system in such a way that one can\nisolate the particular cause-and-effect relationship. Thus, to test whether a ball and a feather will fall at\nthe same rate in a frictionless vacuum, experimenters could create a vacuum environment and measure\nthe rate of descent of the ball versus the feather. In economic systems, such experiments are virtually\nimpossible because one can never eliminate all the “frictions.”\nHowever, by creating mathematical economic systems (i.e., an economic model), it becomes possible to\nconduct similar types of “experiments.” A comparative statics exercise allows one to isolate how a change\n\nin one exogenous variable affects the value of the equilibrium variable while controlling for changes in\nother variables that might also affect the outcome.\nThe Effect of Changes in U.S. Interest Rates on the Spot Exchange Rate\nSuppose that the Forex is initially in equilibrium\nFigure 5.2 Effects of a U.S. Interest Rate Increase\nsuch that S = D at the exchange rate E.

The graph is called the rate of return diagram since it depicts rates of\nreturn for assets in two separate countries as functions of the exchange rate. The equilibrium condition\ndepicted in the diagram represents the interest rate parity condition. In effect, the diagram identifies the\nequilibrium exchange rate that must prevail to satisfy the interest rate parity condition.\nRecall the rate of return formulas for deposits in two separate countries. Consider an investor, holding\nU.S. dollars, comparing the purchase of a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) at a U.S. bank with a one-\nyear CD issued by a British bank. The rate of return on the U.S. deposit works out simply to be the U.S.\ninterest rate shown below:\nRoR = i .\n$ $\nThe rate of return on the British asset, however, is a more complicated formula that depends on the\nBritish interest rate (i ), the spot exchange rate (E ), and the expected exchange rate (E e).

Assuming ceteris paribus, as we always do in these exercises, the\n$/£\nexpected exchange rate remains fixed.

          ],
          "content": "Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a theory of exchange rate determination and a way to compare the\naverage costs of goods and services between countries. The theory assumes that the actions of importers\nand exporters (motivated by cross-country price differences) induce changes in the spot exchange rate. In\nanother vein, PPP suggests that transactions on a country’s current account affect the value of the\nexchange rate on the foreign exchange (Forex) market. This is in contrast with the interest rate parity\ntheory, which assumes that the actions of investors (whose transactions are recorded on the capital\naccount) induce changes in the exchange rate.\nPPP theory is based on an extension and variation of the “law of one price” as applied to the aggregate\neconomy. To explain the theory it is best to first review the idea behind the law of one price.\nThe Law of One Price (LoOP)\nThe law of one price says that identical goods should sell for the same price in two separate markets when\nthere are no transportation costs and no differential taxes applied in the two markets. Consider the\nfollowing information about movie video tapes sold in the U.S. and Mexican markets.\nPrice of videos in U.S. market (Pv )\n$\n$20\nPrice of videos in Mexican market (Pv )\np\nP150\nSpot exchange rate (\nEp/$)\n10 P/$\nThe dollar price of videos sold in Mexico can be calculated by dividing the video price in pesos by the spot\nexchange rate as show:\nTo see why the peso price is divided by the exchange rate rather than multiplied, notice the conversion of\nunits shown in the brackets. If the law of one price held, then the dollar price in Mexico should match the\n\nprice in the United States. Since the dollar price of the video is less than the dollar price in the United\nStates, the law of one price does not hold in this circumstance.\nThe next question to ask is what might happen as a result of the discrepancy in prices. Well, as long as\nthere are no costs incurred to transport the goods, there is a profit-making opportunity through trade. For\nexample, U.S. travelers in Mexico who recognize that identical video titles are selling there for 25 percent\nless might buy videos in Mexico and bring them back to the United States to sell. This is an example of\n“goods arbitrage.” An arbitrage opportunity arises whenever one can buy something at a low price in one\nlocation, resell it at a higher price, and thus make a profit.\nUsing basic supply and demand theory, the increase in demand for videos in Mexico would push up the\nprice of videos. The increase in supply of videos on the U.S. market would force the price down in the\nUnited States. In the end, the price of videos in Mexico may rise to, say, p180 while the price of videos in\nthe United States may fall to $18. At these new prices the law of one price holds since\nThe idea in the law of one price is that identical goods selling in an integrated market in which there are\nno transportation costs, no differential taxes or subsidies, and no tariffs or other trade barriers should sell\nat identical prices. If different prices prevailed, then there would be profit-making opportunities by\nbuying the good in the low price market and reselling it in the high price market. If entrepreneurs took\nadvantage of this arbitrage opportunity, then the prices would converge to equality.\nOf course, for many reasons the law of one price does not hold even between markets within a country.\nThe price of beer, gasoline, and stereos will likely be different in New York City and in Los Angeles. The\nprice of these items will also be different in other countries when converted at current exchange rates. The\nsimple reason for the discrepancies is that there are costs to transport goods between locations, there are\ndifferent taxes applied in different states and different countries, nontradable input prices may vary, and\npeople do not have perfect information about the prices of goods in all markets at all times. Thus to refer\nto this as an economic “law” does seem to exaggerate its validity.\nFrom LoOP to PPP\n\nThe purchasing power parity theory is really just the law of one price applied in the aggregate but with a\nslight twist added. If it makes sense from the law of one price that identical goods should sell for identical\nprices in different markets, then the law ought to hold for all identical goods sold in both markets.\nFirst, let’s define the variable CB to represent the cost of a basket of goods in the United States\n$\ndenominated in dollars. For simplicity we could imagine using the same basket of goods used in the\nconstruction of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI ). The consumer price index (CPI) uses a market\n$\nbasket of goods that are purchased by an average household during a specified period. The basket is\ndetermined by surveying the quantity of different items purchased by many different households. One can\nthen determine, on average, how many units of bread, milk, cheese, rent, electricity, and so on are\npurchased by the typical household. You might imagine it’s as if all products are purchased in a grocery\nstore with items being placed in a basket before the purchase is made. CB then represents the dollar cost\n$\nof purchasing all the items in the market basket. We will similarly define CB to be the cost of a market\np\nbasket of goods in Mexico denominated in pesos.\nNow if the law of one price holds for each individual item in the market basket, then it should hold for the\nmarket baskets as well. In other words,\nRewriting the right-hand side equation allows us to put the relationship in the form commonly used to\ndescribe absolute purchasing power parity, which is\nIf this condition holds between two countries, then we would say PPP is satisfied. The condition says that\nthe PPP exchange rate (pesos per dollar) will equal the ratio of the costs of the two market baskets of\ngoods denominated in local currency units. Note that the reciprocal relationship is also\nvalid.\nBecause the cost of a market basket of goods is used in the construction of the country’s consumer price\nindex, PPP is often written as a relationship between the exchange rate and the country’s price indices.\nHowever, it is not possible merely to substitute the price index directly for the cost of the market basket\n\nused above. To see why, we will review the construction of the CPI in Chapter 6 \"Purchasing Power\nParity\", Section 6.2 \"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and PPP\".",

          "content": "The consumer price index (CPI) is an index that measures the average level of prices of goods and services\nin an economy relative to a base year. To track only what happens to prices, the quantities of goods\npurchased is assumed to remain fixed from year to year. This is accomplished by determining—with\nsurvey methods—the average quantities of all goods and services purchased by a typical household during\nsome period. The quantities of all of these goods together are referred to as the average market basket. For\nexample, the survey might find that the average household in one month purchases 10 gallons of gas, 15\ncans of beer, 3.2 gallons of milk, 2.6 pounds of butter, and so on. The basket of goods would also contain\nitems like health and auto insurance, housing services, utility services, and many other items. We can\ndescribe the market basket easily as a collection or set of quantities (Q, Q , Q ,…, Qn). Here Qmay be the\n1 2 3 1\nquantity of gasoline, Q the quantity of beer, and so on. The set has ndifferent quantity entries, implying\n2\nthat there are n different items in the market basket.\nThe cost of the market basket is found by surveying the average prices for each of the nproducts in the\nmarket in question. This survey would yield a collection or set of prices (P, P , P ,…, Pn). The cost of the\n1 2 3\nmarket basket is then found by summing the product of the price and quantity for each item. That\nis, CB = PQ + P Q + P Q +…+ PnQn, or\n1 1 2 2 3 3\nThe first year in which the index is constructed is called the base year. Suppose 1982 is the base year for\nthe United States. Let CBYY represent the cost of the market basket evaluated at the prices that prevail in\nthe year (YY) (e.g., CB is the cost of a market basket evaluated in 2009 prices). The CPI is derived\n09\naccording to the following formula:\nwhere CPIYY is the CPI in the year (YY). The term is multiplied by 100 by convention, probably because it\nreduces the need to use digits after a decimal point. Notice that the CPI in the base year is equal to 100—\n\nthat is, CPI = 100—because CB /CB = 1. This is true for all indices—they are by convention set to 100\n82 82 82\nin the base year.\nThe CPI in a different year (either earlier or later) represents the ratio of the cost of the market basket in\nthat year relative to the cost of the same basket in the base year. If in 1982 the cost of the market basket\nrises, then the CPI will rise above 100. If the cost of the market basket falls, then the CPI would fall below\n100.\nIf the CPI rises, it does not mean that the prices of all the goods in the market basket have risen. Some\nprices may rise more or less. Some prices may even fall. The CPI measures the average price change of\ngoods and services in the basket.\nThe inflation rate for an economy is the percentage change in the CPI during a year. Thus if CPI on\n08\nJanuary 1, 2008, and CPI on January 1, 2009, are the price indices, then the inflation rate during 2008\n09\nis given by\nPPP Using the CPI\nThe purchasing power parity relationship can be written using the CPI with some small adjustments.\nFirst, consider the following ratio of 2009 consumer price indices between Mexico and the United States:\nGiven that the base year is 2008, the ratio is written in terms of the market basket costs on the right-hand\nside and then rewritten into another form. The far right-hand side expression now reflects the purchasing\npower parity exchange rates in 2009 divided by the PPP exchange rate in 2008, the base year. In other\nwords,\nSo, in general, if you want to use the consumer price indices for two countries to derive the PPP exchange\nrate for 2009, you must apply the following formula, derived by rewriting the above as\n\nWhere represents the PPP exchange rate that prevails in the base year between the two\ncountries. Note that in order for this formula to work correctly, the CPIs in both countries must share the\nsame base year. If they did not, a more complex formula would need to be derived.",

          ],
          "content": "The purchasing power parity (PPP) relationship becomes a theory of exchange rate determination by\nintroducing assumptions about the behavior of importers and exporters in response to changes in the\nrelative costs of national market baskets. Recall the story of the law of one price, when the price of a good\ndiffered between two countries’ markets and there was an incentive for profit-seeking individuals to buy\nthe good in the low price market and resell it in the high price market. Similarly, if a market basket\ncontaining many different goods and services costs more in one market than another, we should likewise\nexpect profit-seeking individuals to buy the relatively cheaper goods in the low-cost market and resell\nthem in the higher-priced market. If the law of one price leads to the equalization of the prices of a good\nbetween two markets, then it seems reasonable to conclude that PPP, describing the equality of market\nbaskets across countries, should also hold.\nHowever, adjustment within the PPP theory occurs with a twist compared to adjustment in the law of one\nprice story. In the law of one price story, goods arbitrage in a particular product was expected to affect the\nprices of the goods in the two markets. The twist that’s included in the PPP theory is that arbitrage,\noccurring across a range of goods and services in the market basket, will affect the exchange rate rather\nthan the market prices.\nPPP Equilibrium Story\nTo see why the PPP relationship represents an equilibrium, we need to tell an equilibrium story. An\nequilibrium story in an economic model is an explanation of how the behavior of individuals will cause the\nequilibrium condition to be satisfied. The equilibrium condition is the PPP equation written as\nThe endogenous variable in the PPP theory is the exchange rate. Thus we need to explain why the\nexchange rate will change if it is not in equilibrium. In general there are always two versions of an\nequilibrium story, one in which the endogenous variable (E here) is too high and one in which it is too\np/$\nlow.\n\nPPP equilibrium story 1. Let’s consider the case in which the exchange rate is too low to be in\nequilibrium. This means that\nwhere E is the exchange rate that prevails on the spot market. Since it is less than the ratio of the market\np/$\nbasket costs in Mexico and the United States, it is also less than the PPP exchange rate. The right side of\nthe expression is rewritten to show that the cost of a market basket in the United States evaluated in pesos\n(i.e., CB E ) is less than the cost of the market basket in Mexico also evaluated in pesos. Thus it is\n$ p/$\ncheaper to buy the basket in the United States, or in other words, it is more profitable to sell items in the\nmarket basket in Mexico.\nThe PPP theory now suggests that the cheaper basket in the United States will lead to an increase in\ndemand for goods in the U.S. market basket by Mexico. As a consequence, it will increase the demand for\nU.S. dollars on the\nFigure 6.1 Forex Adjustment When E Is Low\nforeign exchange p/$\n(Forex) market.\nDollars are needed\nbecause purchases of U.S.\ngoods require U.S.\ndollars. Alternatively, U.S.\nexporters will realize that\ngoods sold in the\nUnited States can be sold\nat a higher price in\nMexico. If these goods are\nsold in pesos, the U.S.\nexporters will want to\nconvert the proceeds back\nto dollars. Thus there is an increase in U.S. dollar demand (by Mexican importers) and an increase in peso\nsupply (by U.S. exporters) on the Forex. This effect is represented by a rightward shift in the U.S. dollar\n\ndemand curve in Figure 6.1 \"Forex Adjustment When \". At the same time, U.S. consumers will reduce\ntheir demand for the pricier Mexican goods. This will reduce the supply of dollars (in exchange for pesos)\non the Forex, which is represented by a leftward shift in the U.S. dollar supply curve in the Forex market.\nBoth the shift in demand and supply will cause an increase in the value of the dollar and thus the\nexchange rate (E ) will rise. As long as the U.S. market basket remains cheaper, excess demand for the\np/$\ndollar will persist and the exchange rate will continue to rise. The pressure for change ceases once the\nexchange rate rises enough to equalize the cost of market baskets between the two countries and PPP\nholds.\nPPP equilibrium story 2. Now let’s consider the other equilibrium story (i.e., the case in which the\nexchange rate is too high to be in equilibrium). This implies that\nThe left-side expression says that the spot exchange rate is greater than the ratio of the costs of market\nbaskets between Mexico and the\nFigure 6.2 Forex Adjustment When E Is High\np/$\nUnited States. In other words, the\nexchange rate is above the PPP\nexchange rate. The right-side\nexpression says that the cost of a\nU.S. market basket, converted to\npesos at the current exchange rate,\nis greater than the cost of a Mexican\nmarket basket in pesos. Thus, on\naverage, U.S. goods are relatively\nmore expensive while Mexican\ngoods are relatively cheaper.\nThe price discrepancies should lead\nconsumers in the United States or\nimporting firms to purchase less expensive goods in Mexico. To do so, they will raise the supply of dollars\nin the Forex in exchange for pesos. Thus the supply curve of dollars will shift to the right as shown\n\nin Figure 6.2 \"Forex Adjustment When \". At the same time, Mexican consumers would refrain from\npurchasing the more expensive U.S. goods. This would lead to a reduction in demand for dollars in\nexchange for pesos on the Forex. Hence, the demand curve for dollars shifts to the left. Due to the demand\ndecrease and the supply increase, the exchange rate (E ) falls. This means that the dollar depreciates and\np/$\nthe peso appreciates.\nExtra demand for pesos will continue as long as goods and services remain cheaper in Mexico. However,\nas the peso appreciates (the dollar depreciates), the cost of Mexican goods rises relative to U.S. goods. The\nprocess ceases once the PPP exchange rate is reached and market baskets cost the same in both markets.\nAdjustment to Price Level Changes under PPP\nIn the PPP theory, exchange rate changes are induced by changes in relative price levels between two\ncountries. This is true because the quantities of the goods are always presumed to remain fixed in the\nmarket baskets. Therefore, the only way that the cost of the basket can change is if the goods’ prices\nchange. Since price level changes represent inflation rates, this means that differential inflation rates will\ninduce exchange rate changes according to the theory.\nIf we imagine that a country begins with PPP, then the inequality given in equilibrium story 1,\ncan arise if the price level rises in Mexico (peso inflation), if the price level falls in the\nUnited States (dollar deflation), or if Mexican inflation is more rapid than U.S. inflation. According to the\ntheory, the behavior of importers and exporters would now induce a dollar appreciation and a peso\ndepreciation. In summary, an increase in Mexican prices relative to the change in U.S. prices (i.e., more\nrapid inflation in Mexico than in the United States) will cause the dollar to appreciate and the peso to\ndepreciate according to the purchasing power parity theory.\nSimilarly, if a country begins with PPP, then the inequality given in equilibrium story 2,\ncan arise if the price level rises in the United States (dollar inflation), the price level falls in Mexico (peso\ndeflation), or if U.S. inflation is more rapid than Mexican inflation. In this case, the inequality would\naffect the behavior of importers and exporters and induce a dollar depreciation and peso appreciation. In\nsummary, more rapid inflation in the United States would cause the dollar to depreciate while the peso\nwould appreciate.",

          ],
          "content": "Problems with the PPP Theory\nThe main problem with the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory is that the PPP condition is rarely\nsatisfied within a country. There are quite a few reasons that can explain this and so, given the logic of the\ntheory, which makes sense, economists have been reluctant to discard the theory on the basis of lack of\nsupporting evidence. Below we consider some of the reasons PPP may not hold.\nTransportation costs and trade restrictions. Since the PPP theory is derived from the law of one price, the\nsame assumptions are needed for both theories. The law of one price assumes that there are no\ntransportation costs and no differential taxes applied between the two markets. These mean that there can\nbe no tariffs on imports or other types of restrictions on trade. Since transport costs and trade restrictions\ndo exist in the real world, this would tend to drive prices for similar goods apart. Transport costs should\nmake a good cheaper in the exporting market and more expensive in the importing market. Similarly, an\nimport tariff would drive a wedge between the prices of an identical good in two trading countries’\nmarkets, raising it in the import market relative to the export market price. Thus the greater\ntransportation costs and trade restrictions are between countries, the less likely for the costs of market\nbaskets to be equalized.\nCosts of nontradable inputs. Many items that are homogeneous nevertheless sell for different prices\nbecause they require a nontradable input in the production process. As an example, consider why the\nprice of a McDonald’s Big Mac hamburger sold in downtown New York City is higher than the price of the\nsame product in the New York suburbs. Because the rent for restaurant space is much higher in the city\ncenter, the restaurant will pass along its higher costs in the form of higher prices. Substitute products in\nthe city center (other fast food restaurants) will face the same high rental costs and thus will charge higher\nprices as well. Because it would be impractical (i.e., costly) to produce the burgers at a cheaper suburban\nlocation and then transport them for sale in the city, competition would not drive the prices together in\nthe two locations.\n\nPerfect information. The law of one price assumes that individuals have good, even perfect, information\nabout the prices of goods in other markets. Only with this knowledge will profit seekers begin to export\ngoods to the high price market and import goods from the low-priced market. Consider a case in which\nthere is imperfect information. Perhaps some price deviations are known to traders but other deviations\nare not known, or maybe only a small group of traders know about a price discrepancy and that group is\nunable to achieve the scale of trade needed to equalize the prices for that product. (Perhaps they face\ncapital constraints and can’t borrow enough money to finance the scale of trade needed to equalize\nprices.) In either case, traders without information about price differences will not respond to the profit\nopportunities and thus prices will not be equalized. Thus the law of one price may not hold for some\nproducts, which would imply that PPP would not hold either.\nOther market participants. Notice that in the PPP equilibrium stories, it is the behavior of profit-seeking\nimporters and exporters that forces the exchange rate to adjust to the PPP level. These activities would be\nrecorded on the current account of a country’s balance of payments. Thus it is reasonable to say that the\nPPP theory is based on current account transactions. This contrasts with the interest rate parity theory in\nwhich the behavior of investors seeking the highest rates of return on investments motivates adjustments\nin the exchange rate. Since investors are trading assets, these transactions would appear on a country’s\ncapital account of its balance of payments. Thus the interest rate parity theory is based on capital account\ntransactions.\nIt is estimated that there are approximately $1–2 trillion dollars worth of currency exchanged every day\non international foreign exchange (Forex) markets. That’s one-eighth of U.S. GDP, which is the value of\nproduction in the United States in an entire year. In addition, the $1–2 trillion estimate is made by\ncounting only one side of each currency trade. Thus that’s an enormous amount of trade. If one considers\nthe total amount of world trade each year and then divides by 365, one can get the average amount of\ngoods and services traded daily. This number is less than $100 billion dollars. This means that the\namount of daily currency transactions is more than ten times the amount of daily trade. This fact would\nseem to suggest that the primary effect on the daily exchange rate must be caused by the actions of\ninvestors rather than importers and exporters. Thus the participation of other traders in the Forex\nmarket, who are motivated by other concerns, may lead the exchange rate to a value that is not consistent\nwith PPP.\n\nRelative PPP\nThere is an alternative version of the PPP theory called the “relative PPP theory.” In essence this is a\ndynamic version of the absolute PPP theory. Since absolute PPP suggests that the exchange rate may\nrespond to inflation, we can imagine that the exchange rate would change in a systematic way given that a\ncontinual change in the price level (inflation) is occurring.\nIn the relative PPP theory, exchange rate changes over time are assumed to be dependent on inflation rate\ndifferentials between countries according to the following formula:\nHere the percentage change in the dollar value between the first period and the second period is given on\nthe left side. The right side gives the differences in the inflation rates between Mexico and the United\nStates that were evaluated over the same time period. The implication of relative PPP is that if the\nMexican inflation rate exceeds the U.S. inflation rate, then the dollar will appreciate by that differential\nover the same period. The logic of this theory is the same as in absolute PPP. Importers and exporters\nrespond to variations in the relative costs of market baskets so as to maintain the law of one price, at least\non average. If prices continue to rise faster in Mexico than in the United States, for example, price\ndifferences between the two countries would grow and the only way to keep up with PPP is for the dollar\nto appreciate continually versus the peso.",

          "content": "In general, the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory works miserably when applied to real-world data. In\nother words, it is rare for the PPP relationship to hold true between any two countries at any particular\npoint in time. In most scientific disciplines, the failure of a theory to be supported by the data means the\ntheory is refuted and should be thrown out or tossed away. However, economists have been reluctant to\ndo that with the PPP theory. In part this is because the logic of the theory seems particularly sound. In\npart it’s because there are so many “frictions” in the real world, such as tariffs, nontariff barriers,\ntransportation costs, measurement problems, and so on that it would actually be surprising for the theory\nto work when applied directly to the data. (It is much like expecting an object to follow Newton’s laws of\nmotion while sitting on the ground.)\nIn addition, economists have conceived of an alternative way to interpret or apply the PPP theory to\novercome the empirical testing problem. The trick is to think of PPP as a “long-run” theory of exchange\nrate determination rather than a short-run theory. Under such an interpretation, it is no longer necessary\nfor PPP to hold at any point in time. Instead, the PPP exchange rate is thought to represent a target\ntoward which the spot exchange rate is slowly drawn.\nThis long-run interpretation requires an assumption that importers and exporters cannot respond quickly\nto deviations in the cost of market baskets between countries. Instead of immediate responses to price\ndifferences between countries by engaging in arbitrage—buying at the low price and selling high—traders\nrespond slowly to these price signals. Some reasons for the delay include imperfect information (traders\nare not aware of the price differences), long-term contracts (traders must wait till current contractual\narrangements expire), and/or marketing costs (entry to new markets requires research and setup costs).\nIn addition, we recognize that the exchange rate is not solely determined by trader behavior. Investors,\nwho respond to different incentives, might cause persistent deviations from the PPP exchange rate even if\ntraders continue to respond to the price differences.\nWhen there is a delayed response, PPP no longer needs to hold at a particular point in time. However, the\ntheory does imagine that traders eventually will adjust to the price differences (buying low and selling\nhigh), causing an eventual adjustment of the spot exchange rate toward the PPP rate. However, as\n\nadjustment occurs, it is quite possible that the PPP exchange rate also continues to change. In this case,\nthe spot exchange rate is adjusting toward a moving target.\nHow long will this adjustment take? In other words, how long is the long run? The term itself is generally\nused by economists to represent some “unspecified” long period of time; it might be several months,\nyears, or even decades. Also, since the target, the PPP exchange rate, is constantly changing, it is quite\npossible that it is never reached. The adjustment process may never allow the exchange rate to catch up to\nthe target even though it is constantly chasing it.\nPerhaps the best way to see what the long-run PPP theory suggests is to considerFigure 6.3 \"Hypothetical\nLong-Term Trend\". The figure presents constructed data (i.e., made up) between two countries, A and B.\nThe dotted black line shows the ratio of the costs of market baskets between the two countries over a long\nperiod, a century between 1904 and 2004. It displays a steady increase, indicating that prices have risen\nfaster in country A relative to country B. The solid blue line shows a plot of the exchange rate between the\ntwo countries during the same period. If PPP were to hold at every point in time, then the exchange rate\nplot would lie directly on top of the market basket ratio plot. The fact that it does not means PPP did not\nhold all the time. In fact, PPP held only at times when the exchange rate plot crosses the market basket\nratio plot; on the diagram this happened only twice during the century—not a very good record.\nNonetheless, despite performing poorly with respect to moment-by-moment PPP, the figure displays an\nobvious regularity. The trend of the exchange rate between the countries is almost precisely the trend in\nthe market basket ratio; both move upward at about the same “average” rate. Sometimes the exchange\nrate is below the market basket ratio, even for a long period of time, but at other times, the exchange rate\nrises up above the market basket ratio.\nThe\nFigure 6.4 U.S./UK Long-Term Trends\nide\na\nher\ne is\nthat\nlen\ngth\n\ny exchange rate deviations from the market basket ratio (i.e., the PPP exchange rate) mean long periods of\ntime in which the cost of goods is cheaper in one country than in another. Eventually, traders will respond\nto these price discrepancies and begin to import more from the less expensive country. This will lead to\nthe increase in demand for that country’s currency and cause the exchange rate to move back toward the\nmarket basket ratio. However, in the long-run version of the theory, this will take time, sometimes a\nconsiderable amount of time, even years or more.\nTo see how this relationship works in one real-world example, consider Figure 6.4 \"U.S./UK Long-Term\nTrends\". It plots the exchange rate (E ) between the U.S. dollar and the British pound between 1913 and\n$/£\n2004 together with an adjusted ratio of the countries’ consumer price indices (CPIs) during the same\nperiod. [1] The adjusted ratio represents an estimate of the ratio of the costs of market baskets between the\ntwo countries.\nIn the diagram, the dotted black line represents the estimated ratio of market basket costs and the solid\nblue line is the exchange rate (E ). Note how closely the exchange rate tracks the trend in the market\n$/£\nbasket ratio. This remains true even though the exchange rate remained fixed during some lengthy\nperiods of time, as in the 1950s and 1960s. While this depiction is just two countries over a long period, it\nis suggestive that the long-run version of PPP may have some validity.\nMore sophisticated empirical tests of the long-run version of PPP have shown mixed results, as some\nstudies support the hypothesis while others tend to reject it. Regardless, there is much more support for\nthis version of the theory than for the much more simplistic short-run version.",

          ],
          "content": "interpreted.\nIt is quite common to hear people claim that a country’s exchange rate is overvalued or undervalued. The\nfirst question one should ask when someone claims the exchange rate is overvalued is “overvalued with\nrespect to what?” There are two common reference exchange rates often considered. The person may\nmean the exchange rate is overvalued with respect to purchasing power parity (PPP), or he may mean the\nexchange rate is overvalued relative to the rate presumed Needed to balance the current account (CA).\nThe mere use of these terms suggests immediately that there is some “proper” value for the exchange rate.\nHowever, one should refrain from accepting this implication. As was previously discussed, PPP is unlikely\nto hold, even over very long periods, for a variety of very good reasons. Also, there is no reason to think\nthat current account balance represents some equilibrium or goal for an economy: countries can run trade\ndeficits or surpluses for an extended period and suffer no ill effects. Thus overvaluation or undervaluation\nof an exchange rate, for either reason (PPP or current account balance) should be thought of simply as\nsomething that happens. Of more interest is what it means when it happens.\nOver- and Undervaluation with Respect to PPP\nFirst let’s consider over- and undervaluation with respect to PPP. The PPP exchange rate is defined as the\nrate that equalizes the cost of a market basket of goods between two countries. The PPP exchange rate\nbetween the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar would be written as\nwhich represents the PPP value of the U.S. dollar in terms of pesos.\nIf the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the Mexican peso, then the spot exchange rate exceeds the\nPPP exchange rate:\nThis will also mean the exchange rate exceeds the ratio of market basket costs:\n\ntherefore, the following will hold:\nThe left side (LS) of this expression represents the cost of a U.S. market basket converted to pesos at the\ncurrent spot exchange rate. The right side (RS) is the cost of the basket in Mexico also evaluated in pesos.\nSince LS > RS, goods and services cost more on average in the United States than in Mexico at the current\nexchange rate. Thus for the U.S. dollar to be overvalued with respect to the peso means that goods and\nservices are relatively more expensive in the United States than in Mexico. Of course, it also implies that\ngoods and services are relatively cheaper in Mexico.\nA simple guide to judge whether a currency is overvalued is to consider it from the perspective of a tourist.\nWhen the U.S. dollar is overvalued, a U.S. tourist traveling to Mexico will find that many products seem\ncheaper than in the United States, after converting at the spot exchange rate. Thus an overvalued currency\nwill buy more in other countries.\nAn undervalued currency works in the opposite direction. When the U.S. dollar is undervalued, the cost of\na basket of goods in the United States is lower than the cost in Mexico when evaluated at the current\nexchange rate. To a U.S. tourist, Mexican goods and services would seem more expensive on average.\nThus an undervalued currency will buy less in other countries.\nFinally, if the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the Mexican peso, it follows that the peso is\nundervalued with respect to the dollar. In this case, since the U.S. tourists would find Mexican goods\ncomparatively cheap, Mexican tourists would find U.S. goods to be comparatively expensive. If the U.S.\ndollar were undervalued, then the peso would be overvalued.\nIs overvaluation or undervaluation good or bad? That depends on what a person is trying to achieve. For\nexample, if the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the peso, then a U.S. tourist traveling to Mexico\nwill be very happy. In fact, the more overvalued the dollar is, the better. However, for an exporter of U.S.\ngoods to Mexico, its price in peso terms will be higher the more overvalued is the dollar. Thus an\novervalued dollar will likely reduce sales and profits for these U.S. firms.\nOver- and Undervaluation with Respect to Current Account Balance\nThe second way over- and undervaluation is sometimes applied is in comparison to an exchange rate\npresumed necessary to induce trade balance, or balance on the current account. If one imagines that a\n\ntrade deficit, for example, arises primarily because a country imports too much or exports too little (rather\nthan being driven by financial decisions tending to cause a financial account surplus), then one may also\nlook for ways to either reduce imports or raise exports. A change in the exchange rate offers one viable\nmethod to affect trade flows.\nSuppose the United States has a trade deficit (which it indeed has had for more than thirty years prior to\n2010). If the U.S. dollar value were to fall—a dollar depreciation—then foreign goods would all become\nrelatively more expensive to U.S. residents, tending to reduce U.S. imports. At the same time, a dollar\ndepreciation would also cause U.S. goods to become relatively cheaper to foreign residents tending to\nraise U.S. exports.\nSometimes economists make numerical estimations as to how much the dollar value would have to fall to\nbring trade into balance. These estimations are enormously difficult to make for several reasons and\nshould be interpreted and used with great caution, if at all. The primary reason is that many different\nfactors on both the trade side and the financial side influence a country’s trade imbalance besides just the\nexchange rate. The exchange rate that balances trade would depend on the values taken by all the other\nfactors that also influence the trade balance. Different values for all the other variables would mean a\ndifferent exchange rate needed to balance trade. Thus there isn’t one exchange rate value that will balance\ntrade. Instead, there is a different exchange rate value that will balance trade in each and every alternative\ncircumstance. Indeed, even the current exchange rate—whatever that is—can balance trade if other factors\nchange appropriately.\nDespite these cautions, many observers will still contend that a country’s currency needs to depreciate by\nsome percentage to eliminate a trade deficit, or needs to appreciate to eliminate a trade surplus. When it\nis believed a depreciation of the currency is needed to balance trade, they will say the currency is\novervalued. When it is believed an appreciation of the currency is needed to balance trade, they will say\nthe currency is undervalued. However, in a floating exchange rate system, it is hard to argue that the\nexchange rate is at the “wrong” value since—with competition in the market—it will always be at the rate\nthat equalizes supply and demand. In other words, the “proper” value for the exchange rate can be said to\nbe not the one that will satisfy PPP or not the one that will generate trade balance but rather whatever rate\ncurrently prevails. Under this notion, a currency can never be over- or undervalued in a floating exchange\nrate system. Instead, the spot exchange rate is always at the “proper” value.\n\nIn a fixed exchange rate system, a government can sometimes intervene to maintain an exchange rate that\nis very different from what would arise if allowed to float. In these cases, large trade surpluses can arise\nbecause the government maintains an artificially low value for its currency. Calls for a revaluation\n(appreciation) of the currency, to promote a reduction in a trade surplus, are somewhat more appropriate\nin these cases since the market does not determine the exchange rate. Similarly, large deficits could be\nreduced with a devaluation (depreciation) of the currency.",

          "content": "method for making cross-country comparisons.\nProbably the most important application of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is in making\ncross-country comparisons of income, wages, or gross domestic product (GDP). Suppose that we would\nlike to compare per capita GDP between two countries—say, the United States and China. In 2004, GDP\nin the United States was approximately $12 trillion; in China GDP was about ¥16 trillion. With a\npopulation in the United States of 290 million people, per capita U.S. GDP works out to $41,400 per\nperson. China’s population was approximately 1.3 billion people in 2004, so its GDP per capita works out\nto 11,500 yuan (¥) per person. However, we can’t compare these two per capita figures since they are in\ndifferent units—dollars and yuan. Thus we need to convert units, either turn dollars into yuan or yuan into\ndollars.\nThe simplest approach to make this conversion is to use the spot exchange rate that prevailed in 2004,\nwhich was 8.28 yuan per dollar. Converting yuan to dollars yields a per capita GDP for China of $1,390.\nNote that at $41,400 per person, U.S. per capita GDP was almost thirty times higher than China’s.\nHowever, there is a problem using this method. One thing that is quickly recognized by Americans when\nthey travel in and around China is that many goods and services seem considerably cheaper than they are\nin the United States. From a Chinese traveler’s perspective, many U.S. goods would seem considerably\nmore expensive. The implication is that although U.S. GDP per person is thirty times higher, that income\nmay not purchase thirty times more goods and services in the U.S. because the prices of U.S. goods and\nservices are so much higher when converted at the current exchange rate. Since presumably we are\ncomparing per capita GDPs to compare how “well-off” people are in one country relative to another, these\nper capita figures will not accurately reflect these differences.\nA solution is found in the purchasing power parity theory (PPP). When prices for similar goods differ as\ndescribed in the previous paragraph, we would say the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the yuan\nand with respect to PPP. At the same time, we would say the yuan is undervalued vis-à-vis the dollar. One\nway to reach comparable (or equalized) values of goods and services between the countries is to apply the\n\nPPP exchange rate in the conversion. The PPP exchange rate is that exchange rate that would equalize the\nvalue of comparable market baskets of goods and services between two countries.\nFor example, the estimated PPP exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and yuan in 2004 was 1.85 ¥/$. If\nthis exchange rate had prevailed between the countries, the prices of U.S. goods would seem, on average,\nto be approximately equal to the prices that prevailed in China. Now, if we use this exchange rate to make\nthe conversion to dollars of GDP per capita in China, then we will get a number that reflects the\npurchasing power of Chinese income in terms of the prices that prevail in the United States—that is, in\nterms of prices that are equalized between the countries.\nThus if we take China’s GDP per capita of ¥11,500 and convert to dollars with the PPP exchange rate, we\nget $6,250 per person. The units derived in this expression would typically be called “international\ndollars.” What this means is that ¥11,500 will buy a bundle of goods and services in China that would cost\n$6,250 if purchased in the United States at U.S. prices. In other words, ¥11,500 is equal to $6,250 when\nthe prices of goods and services are equalized between countries.\nThe PPP method of conversion is a much more accurate way of making cross-country comparisons of\nvalues between countries. In this example, although China’s per capita GDP was still considerably lower\nthan in the United States ($6,250 vs. $41,400), it is nonetheless four and a half times higher than using\nthe spot exchange rate ($6,250 vs. $1,390). The higher value takes account of the differences in prices\nbetween the countries and thus better reflects the differences in purchasing power of per capita GDP.\nThe PPP conversion method has become the standard method used by the World Bank and others in\nmaking cross-country comparisons of GDP, GDP per capita, and average incomes and wages. For most\ncomparisons concerning the size of economies or standards of living, using PPP is a more accurate\nmethod and can fundamentally change our perception of how countries compare. To see how,\nconsider Table 6.1 \"GDP Rankings (in Billions of Dollars), 2008\", constructed from World Bank data. It\nshows a ranking of the top ten countries in total GDP converting to dollars using both the current\nexchange rate method and the PPP method.\nTable 6.1 GDP Rankings (in Billions of Dollars), 2008\nUsing Current Exchange Rate Using PPP Exchange Rate\nRank Country ($) Country ($)\n1 United States 14,204 United States 14,204\n\nUsing Current Exchange Rate Using PPP Exchange Rate\nRank Country ($) Country ($)\n2 Japan 4,909 China 7,903\n3 China 4,326 Japan 4,355\n4 Germany 3,653 India 3,338\n5 France 2,853 Germany 2,925\nUnited\n6 Kingdom 2,646 Russia 2,288\nUnited\n7 Italy 2,293 Kingdom 2,176\n8 Brazil 1,613 France 2,112\n9 Russia 1,608 Brazil 1,977\n10 Spain 1,604 Italy 1,841\n11 Canada 1,400 Mexico 1,542\n12 India 1,217 Spain 1,456\nThe United States remains at the top of the list using both methods. However, several countries rise up in\nthe rankings. China rises from the third largest economy using current exchange rates to the second\nlargest using PPP. This means that in terms of the physical goods and services produced by the\neconomies, China really does produce more than Japan. PPP conversion gives a better representation of\nthe relative sizes of these countries.\nSimilarly, India rises from twelfth rank to fourth. Russia also moves up into sixth place from ninth. At the\nsame time, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Brazil, and Spain all move down in the\nrankings. Canada moves out of the top twelve, being replaced by Mexico, which rises up to eleventh.\nFor those countries whose GDP rises in value when converting by PPP (i.e., China, India, and Russia),\ntheir currencies are undervalued with respect to the U.S. dollar. So using the current exchange rate\nmethod underestimates the true size of their economies. For the other countries, their currencies are\n\novervalued to the dollar, so converting their GDPs at current exchange rates gives an overestimate of the\ntrue size of their economies.",

          "content": "equilibrium interest rate in an economy.\nThis chapter describes how the supply of money and the demand for money combine to affect the\nequilibrium interest rate in an economy. The model is called the money market model.\nA country’s money supply is mostly the amount of coin and currency in circulation and the total value of\nall checking accounts in banks. These two types of assets are the most liquid (i.e., most easily used to buy\ngoods and services). The amount of money available to spend in an economy is mostly determined by the\ncountry’s central bank. The bank can control the total amount of money in circulation by using several\nlevers (or tools), the most important of which is the sale or purchase of U.S. government Treasury bonds.\nCentral bank sales or purchases of Treasury bonds are called “open market operations.”\nMoney demand refers to the demand by households, businesses, and the government, for highly liquid\nassets such as currency and checking account deposits. Money demand is affected by the desire to buy\nthings soon, but it is also affected by the opportunity cost of holding money. The opportunity cost is the\ninterest earnings one gives up on other assets to hold money.\nIf interest rates rise, households and businesses will likely allocate more of their asset holdings into\ninterest-bearing accounts (these are usually not classified as money) and will hold less in the form of\nmoney. Since interest-bearing deposits are the primary source of funds used to lend in the financial\nsector, changes in total money demand affect the supply of loanable funds and in turn affect the interest\nrates on loans.\nMoney supply and money demand will equalize only at one average interest rate. Also, at this interest\nrate, the supply of loanable funds financial institutions wish to lend equalizes the amount that borrowers\nwish to borrow. Thus the equilibrium interest rate in the economy is the rate that equalizes money supply\nand money demand.\nUsing the money market model, several important relationships between key economic variables are\nshown:\n• When the money supply rises (falls), the equilibrium interest rate falls (rises).\n• When the price level increases (decreases), the equilibrium interest rate rises (falls).\n\n• When real GDP rises (falls), the equilibrium interest rate rises (falls).\nConnections\nThe money market model connects with the foreign exchange (Forex) market because the interest rate in\nthe economy, which is determined in the money market, determines the rate of return on domestic assets.\nIn the Forex market, interest rates are given exogenously, which means they are determined through\nsome process not specified in the model. However, that process of interest rate determination is described\nin the money market. Economists will sometimes say that once the money market model and Forex model\nare combined, interest rates have been “endogenized.” In other words, interest rates are now conceived as\nbeing determined by more fundamental factors (gross domestic product [GDP] and money supply) that\nare not given as exogenous.\nThe money market model also connects with the goods market model in that GDP, which is determined in\nthe goods market, influences money demand and hence the interest rate in the money market model.",

          "content": "money market model.\n2. Learn how to interpret the equilibrium interest rate in a world in which there are many different\ninterest rates applied and different types of loans and deposits.\nThere are several sources of confusion that can affect complete understanding of this basic model.\nThe first source of confusion concerns the use of the term “money.” In casual conversation, money is\nsometimes used more narrowly and sometimes more broadly than the formal definition. For example,\nsomeone might say, “I want to be a doctor so I will make a lot of money.” In this case, the person is really\nreferring to income, not money, per se. Since income is typically paid using money, the everyday\nsubstitution of the term money for income does make sense, but it can lead to confusion in interpreting\nthe forthcoming model. In general, people use the term money whenever they want to refer to a country’s\ncoin and currency and anything these items are used for in payment. However, our formal definition\nof money also includes items that are not coin and currency. Checking account deposits are an example of\na type of money included in the formal definition but not more casually thought of as money. Thus pay\nattention to the definition and description below and be sure to recognize that one’s common conception\nof money may or may not overlap precisely with the formal definition.\nA second source of confusion involves our usage of the term interest rate. The model that will be\ndeveloped will derive an equilibrium interest rate for the economy. However, everyone knows that there\nare many interest rates in the economy, and each of these rates is different. There are different rates for\nyour checking and savings account, different rates on a car loan and mortgage, different rates on credit\ncards and government bonds. Thus it is typical to wonder what interest rate we are talking about when we\ndescribe the equilibrium interest rate.\nIt is important to note that financial institutions make money (here I really should say “make a profit”) by\nlending to one group at a higher rate than it borrows. In other words, financial institutions accept deposits\nfrom one group of people (savers) and lend it to another group of people (borrowers.) If they charge a\nhigher interest rate on their loans than they do on deposits, the bank will make a profit.\n\nThis implies that, in general, interest rates on deposits to financial institutions are lower than interest\nrates on their loans. When we talk about the equilibrium interest rate in the forthcoming model, it will\nmostly apply to the interest rates on deposits rather than loans. However, we also have a small problem in\ninterpretation since different deposits have different interest rates. Thus which interest rate are we really\ntalking about?\nThe best way to interpret the equilibrium interest rate in the model is as a kind of average interest rate on\ndeposits. At the end of this chapter, we will discuss economic changes that lead to an increase or decrease\nin the equilibrium interest rate. We should take these changes to mean several things. First, that average\ninterest rates on deposits will rise. Now, some of these rates may rise and a few may fall, but there will be\npressure for the average to increase. Second, since banks may be expected to maintain their rate of profit\n(if possible) when average deposit interest rates do increase, average interest rates on loans will also\nincrease. Again, some loan rates may rise and some fall, but the market pressure will tend to push them\nupward.\nThe implication is that when the equilibrium interest rate changes we should expect most interest rates to\nmove in the same direction. Thus the equilibrium interest rate really is referring to an average interest\nrate across the entire economy, for deposits and for loans.",

          ],
          "content": "The money supply in a country refers to a stock of assets that can be readily used to purchase goods and\nservices. An asset is anything that has value. Anything that has value could potentially be used in\nexchange for other goods, services, or assets. However, some assets are more easily exchangeable than\nother assets.\nExamples of assets include currency, checking account balances, stocks, bonds, whole life insurance\npolicies, real estate, and automobiles. Currency—dollar bills in the United States, pounds sterling in\nBritain, and pesos in Mexico—is an asset that is readily exchangeable for goods and services within its\nrespective countries. In contrast, real estate is an asset that is very difficult to use to buy goods. For\nexample, no grocery store would accept ownership of a few square feet of your house in exchange for your\nweekly groceries. The idea of this transaction is unimaginable. Yet these two extreme cases can help us\nunderstand the distinction we make between assets classified as money and those not considered money.\nMost textbook definitions ofmoney begin by defining several of money’s key features.\nMoney as a Unit of Account\nOne of the most important features of money is its application as a unit of account. In other words, we\nchoose to measure the value of goods, services, and assets in terms of currency or money. In ancient\nsocieties, shells, shovels, hoes, knives, cattle, and grain were used as money. In these cases, it would have\nbeen common to define the value of an item in terms of how many shells, or knives, or cows, and so on the\nitem exchanges for. The standard unit of account in a country is its currency: dollars in the United States,\nyen in Japan, and euros in the European Union.\nMoney as a Medium of Exchange\nThe key distinguishing feature of money, as compared with other nonmoney assets, is its role as a medium\nof exchange. Coin, and later currency, came into existence primarily to serve as a vehicle for the exchange\nof goods and services. Rather than hauling around items that you might hope to barter exchange for other\ngoods you need, it is easier and more efficient to carry coin and currency to purchase goods. However, in\norder for money to function in this role, it must have widespread acceptability. Anyone selling something\n\nyou want must be willing to accept the coin or currency you have. Their willingness to accept will in turn\ndepend on the expectation that they’ll be able to use that coin later to buy the goods they want.\nOther types of assets are often not acceptable as a medium of exchange. For example, if I own a $1,000\nU.S. savings bond, I am unlikely to be able to use the bond to purchase items in a store. Bonds can be\ntraded at a bank or a bond market, where exchanges of this sort are common, but not anywhere else. Thus\nbonds do not function as a medium of exchange.\nLiquidity is a term used to describe the distinction made here between bonds and currency. An asset is\nsaid to be liquid if it is readily exchangeable for goods and services. An asset is illiquid if it is not easily\nexchangeable. Thus coin and currency are very liquid assets, while bonds are more illiquid. Real estate is\nan example of a very illiquid asset since it could take a considerable amount of time to convert the\nownership share of a home into a spendable form.\nMoney as a Store of Value\nPerhaps the least important characteristic of money is an ability to serve as a store of value. This is less\nimportant because it does not distinguish money from other assets. All assets serve as a store of value. As\nan example, if I want to save some income from each paycheck so that I can go on a vacation next year, I\nneed to hold that income in a form that will maintain its purchasing power. One simple way to hold it is by\ncashing my paycheck and putting currency into an envelope. That money accumulating in the envelope\nwill be easily used to purchase plane tickets and a hotel room when I take my vacation next year. In this\nway, holding currency will allow me to store value over time. On the other hand, I could cash each\npaycheck and deposit some of the money I want to save into my online stock trading account. With these\nfunds I can purchase stocks, another form of asset.

          "content": "supply.\nThe size of the money stock in a country is primarily controlled by its central bank. In the United States,\nthe central bank is the Federal Reserve Bank while the main group affecting the money supply is the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This committee meets approximately every six weeks and is\nthe body that determines monetary policy. There are twelve voting members, including the seven\nmembers of the Fed Board of Governors and five presidents drawn from the twelve Federal Reserve banks\non a rotating basis. The current Chairman of the Board of Governors is Ben Bernanke (as of January\n2010). Because Bernanke heads the group that controls the money supply of the largest economy in the\nworld, and because the FOMC’s actions can have immediate and dramatic effects on interest rates and\nhence the overall United States and international economic condition, he is perhaps the most\neconomically influential person in the world today. As you’ll read later, because of his importance,\nanything he says in public can have tremendous repercussions throughout the international marketplace.\nThe Fed has three main levers that can be applied to affect the money supply within the economy: (1)\nopen market operations, (2) reserve requirement changes, and (3) changes in the discount rate.\nThe Fed’s First Lever: Open Market Operations\nThe most common lever used by the Fed is open market operations. This refers to Fed purchases or sales\nof U.S. government Treasury bonds or bills. The “open market” refers to the secondary market for these\ntypes of bonds. (The market is called secondary because the government originally issued the bonds at\nsome time in the past.)\nWhen the Fed purchases bonds on the open market it will result in an increase in the money supply. If it\nsells bonds on the open market, it will result in a decrease in the money supply.\nHere’s why. A purchase of bonds means the Fed buys a U.S. government Treasury bond from one of its\nprimary dealers. This includes one of twenty-three financial institutions authorized to conduct trades with\nthe Fed. These dealers regularly trade government bonds on the secondary market and treat the Fed as\none of their regular customers. It is worth highlighting that bonds sold on the secondary open market are\nbonds issued by the government months or years before and will not mature for several months or years\n\nin the future. Thus when the Fed purchases a bond from a primary dealer in the future, when that bond\nmatures, the government would have to pay back the Fed, which is the new owner of that bond.\nWhen the open market operation (OMO) purchase is made, the Fed will credit that dealer’s reserve\ndeposits with the sale price of the bond (e.g., $1 million). The Fed will receive the IOU, or “I owe you” (i.e.,\nbond certificate), in exchange. The money used by the Fed to purchase this bond does not need to come\nfrom somewhere. The Fed doesn’t need gold, other deposits, or anything else to cover this payment.\nInstead, the payment is created out of thin air. An accounting notation is made to indicate that the bank\nselling the bond now has an extra $1 million in its reserve account.\nAt this point, there is still no change in the money supply. However, because of the increase in its reserves,\nthe dealer now has additional money to lend out somewhere else, perhaps to earn a greater rate of return.\nWhen the dealer does lend it, it will create a demand deposit account for the borrower and since a demand\ndeposit is a part of the M1 money supply, money has now been created.\nAs shown in all introductory macroeconomics textbooks, the initial loan, once spent by the borrower, is\nultimately deposited in checking accounts in other banks. These increases in deposits can in turn lead to\nfurther loans, subject to maintenance of the bank’s deposit reserve requirements. Each new loan made\ncreates additional demand deposits and hence leads to further increases in the M1 money supply. This is\ncalled the money multiplier process. Through this process, each $1 million bond purchase by the Fed can\nlead to an increase in the overall money supply many times that level.\nThe opposite effect will occur if the Fed sells a bond in an OMO. In this case, the Fed receives payment\nfrom a dealer (as in our previous example) in exchange for a previously issued government bond. (It is\nimportant to remember that the Fed does not issue government bonds; government bonds are issued by\nthe U.S. Treasury department. If the Fed were holding a mature government bond, the Treasury would be\nobligated to pay off the face value to the Fed, just as if it were a private business or bank.) The payment\nmade by the dealer comes from its reserve assets. These reserves support the dealer’s abilities to make\nloans and in turn to stimulate the money creation process. Now that its reserves are reduced, the dealer’s\nability to create demand deposits via loans is reduced and hence the money supply is also reduced\naccordingly.\nA more detailed description of open market operations can be found at New York Federal Reserve Bank’s\nWeb site athttp://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html.\n\nThe Fed’s Second Lever: Reserve Requirement Changes\nWhen the Fed lowers the reserve requirement on deposits, the money supply increases. When the Fed\nraises the reserve requirement on deposits, the money supply decreases.\nThe reserve requirement is a rule set by the Fed that must be satisfied by all depository institutions,\nincluding commercial banks, savings banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions. The rule requires that a\nfraction of the bank’s total transactions deposits (e.g., this would include checking accounts but not\ncertificates of deposit) be held as a reserve either in the form of coin and currency in its vault or as a\ndeposit (reserve) held at the Fed. The current reserve requirement in the United States (as of December\n2009) is 10 percent for deposits over $55.2 million. (For smaller banks—that is, those with lower total\ndeposits—the reserve requirement is lower.)\nAs discussed above, the reserve requirement affects the ability of the banking system to create additional\ndemand deposits through the money creation process. For example, with a reserve requirement of 10\npercent, Bank A, which receives a deposit of $100, will be allowed to lend out $90 of that deposit, holding\nback $10 as a reserve. The $90 loan will result in the creation of a $90 demand deposit in the name of the\nborrower, and since this is a part of the money supply M1, it rises accordingly. When the borrower spends\nthe $90, a check will be drawn on Bank A’s deposits and this $90 will be transferred to another checking\naccount, say, in Bank B. Since Bank B’s deposits have now risen by $90, it will be allowed to lend out $81\ntomorrow, holding back $9 (10 percent) as a reserve. This $81 will make its way to another bank, leading\nto another increase in deposits, allowing another increase in loans, and so on. The total amount of\ndemand deposits (DD) created through this process is given by the formula\nDD = $100 + (.9)$100 + (.9)(.9)$100 + (.9)(.9)(.9)$100 +….\nThis simplifies to\nDD = $100/(1 − 0.9) = $1,000\nor\nDD = $100/RR,\nwhere RR refers to the reserve requirement.\n\nThis example shows that if the reserve requirement is 10 percent, the Fed could increase the money\nsupply by $1,000 by purchasing a $100 Treasury bill (T-bill) in the open market. However, if the reserve\nrequirement were 5 percent, a $100 T-bill purchase would lead to a $2,000 increase in the money supply.\nHowever, the reserve requirement not only affects the Fed’s ability to create new money but also allows\nthe banking system to create more demand deposits (hence more money) out of the total deposits it now\nhas. Thus if the Fed were to lower the reserve requirement to 5 percent, the banking system would be able\nto increase the volume of its loans considerably and it would lead to a substantial increase in the money\nsupply.\nBecause small changes in the reserve requirement can have substantial effects on the money supply, the\nFed does not use reserve requirement changes as a primary lever to adjust the money supply.\nA more detailed description of open market operations can be found at New York Federal Reserve Bank\nWeb site athttp://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed45.html.\nThe Fed’s Third Lever: Discount Rate/Federal Funds Rate Changes\nWhen the Fed lowers its target federal funds rate and discount rate, it signals an expanded money supply\nand lower overall interest rates.\nWhen the Fed raises its target federal funds rate and discount rate, it signals a reduced money supply and\nhigher overall interest rates.\nIn news stories immediately after the FOMC meets, one is likely to read that the Fed raised (or lowered)\ninterest rates yesterday. For many who read this, it sounds as if the Fed “sets” the interest rates charged\nby banks. In actuality, the Fed only sets one interest rate, and that is the discount rate. The rate that is\nannounced every month is not the discount rate, but the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the\ninterest rate banks charge each other for short-term (usually overnight) loans. The Fed does not actually\nset the federal funds rate, but it does employ open market operations to target this rate at a desired level.\nThus what is announced at the end of each FOMC meeting is the target federal funds rate.\nThe main reason banks make overnight loans to each other each day is to maintain their reserve\nrequirements. Each day some banks may end up with excess reserves. Other banks may find themselves\nshort of reserves. Those banks with excess reserves would prefer to loan out as much as possible at some\nrate of interest rather than earning nothing. Those banks short of reserves are required by law to raise up\ntheir reserves to the required level. Thus banks lend money to each other each night.\n\nIf there is excess demand for money overnight relative to supply, the Fed keeps the discount window\nopen. The discount window refers to a policy by the Fed to lend money on a short-term basis (usually\novernight) to financial institutions. The interest rate charged on these loans is called the discount rate.\nBefore 2003, banks needed to demonstrate that they had exhausted all other options before coming to the\ndiscount window. After 2003, the Fed revised its policies and set a primary credit discount rate and a\nsecondary credit discount rate. Primary credit rates are set 100 basis points (1 percent) above the federal\nfunds rate and are available only to very sound, financially strong banks. Secondary credit rates are set\n150 basis points above the federal funds target rate and are available to banks not eligible for primary\ncredit. Although these loans are typically made overnight, they can be extended for longer periods and can\nbe used for any purpose.\nBefore the changes in discount window policy in 2003, very few banks sought loans through the discount\nwindow. Hence, it was not a very effective lever in monetary policy.\nHowever, the announcement of the federal funds target rate after each FOMC meeting does remain an\nimportant signal about the future course of Fed monetary policy. If the FOMC announces a lower target\nfederal funds rate, one should expect expanded money supply, perhaps achieved through open market\noperations. If the FOMC announces a higher target rate, one should prepare for a\nmore contractionary monetary policy to follow.\nA more detailed description of the discount window can be found on the New York Federal Reserve Bank\nWeb site athttp://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed18.html.

          ],
          "content": "The demand for money represents the desire of households and businesses to hold assets in a form that\ncan be easily exchanged for goods and services. Spendability (or liquidity) is the key aspect of money that\ndistinguishes it from other types of assets. For this reason, the demand for money is sometimes called the\ndemand for liquidity.\nThe demand for money is often broken into two distinct categories: the transactions demand and the\nspeculative demand.\nTransactions Demand for Money\nThe primary reason people hold money is because they expect to use it to buy something sometime soon.\nIn other words, people expect to make transactions for goods or services. How much money a person\nholds onto should probably depend on the value of the transactions that are anticipated. Thus a person on\nvacation might demand more money than on a typical day. Wealthier people might also demand more\nmoney because their average daily expenditures are higher than the average person’s.\nHowever, in this section we are interested not so much in an individual’s demand for money but rather in\nwhat determines the aggregate, economy-wide demand for money. Extrapolating from the individual to\nthe group, we could conclude that the total value of all transactions in the economy during a period would\ninfluence the aggregate transactions demand for money. Gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all\ngoods and services produced during the year, will influence the aggregate value of all transactions since all\nGDP produced will be purchased by someone during the year. GDP may underestimate the demand for\nmoney, though, since people will also need money to buy used goods, intermediate goods, and assets.\nNonetheless, changes in GDP are very likely to affect transactions demand.\nAnytime GDP rises, there will be a demand for more money to make the transactions necessary to buy the\nextra GDP. If GDP falls, then people demand less money for transactions.\nThe GDP that matters here is nominal GDP, meaning GDP measured in terms of the prices that currently\nprevail (GDP at current prices). Economists often break up GDP into a nominal component and a real\ncomponent, where real GDP corresponds to a quantity of goods and services produced after eliminating\n\nany price level changes that have occurred since the price level base year. To convert nominal to real GDP,\nsimply divide nominal GDP by the current U.S. price level (P ); thus\n$\nreal GDP = nominal GDP/P .\n$\nIf we use the variable Y to represent real U.S. GDP and rearrange the equation, we can get\n$\nnominal GDP = P Y .\n$ $\nBy rewriting in this way we can now indicate that since the transactions demand for money rises with an\nincrease in nominal GDP, it will also rise with either an increase in the general price level or an increase in\nreal GDP.\nThus if the amount of goods and services produced in the economy rises while the prices of all products\nremain the same, then total GDP will rise and people will demand more money to make the additional\ntransactions. On the other hand, if the average prices of goods and services produced in the economy rise,\nthen even if the economy produces no additional products, people will still demand more money to\npurchase the higher valued GDP, hence the demand for money to make transactions will rise.\nSpeculative Demand for Money\nThe second type of money demand arises by considering the opportunity cost of holding money. Recall\nthat holding money is just one of many ways to hold value or wealth. Alternative opportunities include\nholding wealth in the form of savings deposits, certificate of deposits, mutual funds, stock, or even real\nestate. For many of these alternative assets interest payments, or at least a positive rate of return, may be\nobtained. Most assets considered money, such as coin and currency and most checking account deposits,\ndo not pay any interest. If one does hold money in the form of a negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW)\naccount, a checking account with interest, the interest earned on that deposit will almost surely be less\nthan on a savings deposit at the same institution.\nThus to hold money implies giving up the opportunity of holding other assets that pay interest. The\ninterest one gives up is the opportunity cost of holding money.\nSince holding money is costly—that is, there is an opportunity cost—people’s demand for money should be\naffected by changes in its cost. Since the interest rate on each person’s next best opportunity may differ\nacross money holders, we can use the average interest rate (i ) in the economy as a proxy for the\n$\n\nopportunity cost. It is likely that as average interest rates rise, the opportunity cost of holding money for\nall money holders will also rise, and vice versa. And as the cost of holding money rises, people should\ndemand less money.\nThe intuition is straightforward, especially if we exaggerate the story. Suppose interest rates on time\ndeposits suddenly increased to 50 percent per year (from a very low base). Such a high interest rate would\nundoubtedly lead individuals and businesses to reduce the amount of cash they hold, preferring instead to\nshift it into the high-interest-yielding time deposits. The same relationship is quite likely to hold even for\nmuch smaller changes in interest rates. This implies that as interest rates rise (fall), the demand for\nmoney will fall (rise). The speculative demand for money, then, simply relates to component of the money\ndemand related to interest rate effects.",

          "content": "use them to define the equilibrium interest rate in an economy.\nDemand\nA money demand function displays the influence that some aggregate economic variables will have on the\naggregate demand for money. The above discussion indicates that money demand will depend positively\non the level of real gross domestic product (GDP) and the price level due to the demand for transactions.\nMoney demand will depend negatively on average interest rates due to speculative concerns. We can\ndepict these relationships by simply using the following functional representation:\nHere MD is the aggregate, economy-wide money demand, P\n$\nis the current U.S. price level, Y\n$\nis the\nUnited States’ real GDP, and i is the average U.S. interest rate. The f stands for “function.” The f is not a\n$\nvariable or parameter value; it simply means that some function exists that would map values for the\nright-side variables, contained within the brackets, into the left-side variable. The “+” symbol above the\nprice level and GDP levels means that there is a positive relationship between changes in that variable and\nchanges in money demand. For example, an increase (decrease) in P would cause an increase (decrease)\n$\nin MD. A “−” symbol above the interest rate indicates that changes in i\n$\nin one direction will cause money\ndemand to change in the opposite direction.\nFor historical reasons, the money demand function is often transformed into a real money demand\nfunction as follows. First, rewrite the function on the right side to get\nIn this version, the price level (P ) is brought outside the function f( ) and multiplied to a new function\n$\nlabeled L( ), called the “liquidity function.” Note that L( ) is different from f( ) since it contains\nonly Y\n$\nand i\n$\nas variables. Since P\n$\nis multiplied to L( ) it will maintain the positive relationship to MD and\nthus is perfectly consistent with the previous specification. Finally, by moving the price level variable to\nthe left side, we can write out the general form of the real money demand function as\n\nThis states that real money demand (MD/P\n$\n) is positively related to changes in real GDP (Y\n$\n) and the\naverage interest rate (i ) according to the liquidity function. We can also say that the liquidity function\n$\nrepresents the real demand for money in the economy—that is, the liquidity function is equivalent to real\nmoney demand.\nFinally, simply for intuition’s sake, any real variable represents the purchasing power of the variable in\nterms of prices that prevailed in the base year of the price index. Thus real money demand can be thought\nof as the purchasing power of money demanded in terms of base year prices.\nSupply\nMoney supply is much easier to describe because we imagine that the level of money balances available in\nan economy is simply set by the actions of the central bank. For this reason, it will not depend on other\naggregate variables such as the interest rate, and thus we need no function to describe it.\nWe will use the parameter M $S to represent the nominal U.S. money supply and assume that the Federal\nReserve Bank (or simply “the Fed”), using its three levers, can set this variable wherever it chooses. To\nrepresent real money supply, however, we will need to convert by dividing by the price level. Hence let\nrepresent the real money supply in terms of prices that prevailed in the base year.\nEquilibrium\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined at the level that will equalize real money supply with real\nmoney demand. We can\nFigure 7.1 The Money Market\ndepict the equilibrium by\ngraphing the money supply\nand demand functions on\nthe following diagram.\nThe functions are drawn\nin Figure 7.1 \"The Money\nMarket\" with real money,\nboth supply and demand,\n\nplotted along the horizontal axis and the interest rate plotted along the vertical axis.\nReal money supply, , is drawn as a vertical line at the level of money balances, measured best by M1.\nIt is vertical because changes in the interest rate will not affect the money supply in the economy.\nReal money demand—that is, the liquidity function L(i , Y )—is a downward sloping line in i reflecting the\n$ $ $\nspeculative demand for money. In other words, there is a negative relationship presumed to prevail\nbetween the interest rate and real money demand.\nWhere the two lines cross determines the equilibrium interest rate in the economy (i ) since this is the\n$\nonly interest rate that will equalize real money supply with real money demand.",

This excess demand for\nmoney will cause households and\nbusinesses to convert assets from\nless liquid accounts into checking\naccounts or cash in their pockets.\nA typical transaction would\n\ninvolve a person who withdraws money from a savings account to hold cash in his wallet.\nThe savings account balance is not considered a part of the M1 money supply; however, the currency the\nperson puts into his wallet is a part of the money supply. Millions of conversions such as this will be the\nbehavioral response to an interest rate that is below equilibrium. As a result, the financial sector will\nexperience a decrease in time deposit balances, which in turn will reduce their capacity to make loans. In\nother words, withdrawals from savings and other type of nonmoney accounts will reduce the total pool of\nfunds available to be loaned by the financial sector. With fewer funds to lend and the same demand for\nloans, banks will respond by raising interest rates. Higher interest rates will reduce the demand for loans\nhelping to equalize supply and demand for loans. Finally, as interest rates rise, money demand falls until\nit equalizes with the actual money supply. Through this mechanism average interest rates will rise,\nwhenever money demand exceeds money supply.\nInterest Rate Too High\nIf the actual interest rate is higher than the equilibrium rate, for some unspecified reason, then the\nopposite adjustment will occur. In this case, real money supply will exceed real money demand, meaning\nthat the amount of assets or wealth people and businesses are holding in a liquid, spendable form is\ngreater than the amount they would like to hold. The behavioral response would be to convert assets from\nmoney into interest-bearing nonmoney deposits. A typical transaction would be if a person deposits some\nof the cash in his wallet into his savings account. This transaction would reduce money holdings since\ncurrency in circulation is reduced, but will increase the amount of funds available to loan out by the\nbanks. The increase in loanable funds, in the face of constant demand for loans, will inspire banks to\nlower interest rates to stimulate the demand for loans. However, as interest rates fall, the demand for\nmoney will rise until it equalizes again with money supply. Through this mechanism average interest rates\nwill fall whenever money supply exceeds money demand.",

This can be accomplished with open market purchases of government bonds,\nwith a decrease in the reserve requirement, or with an announced decrease in the discount rate. In most\ngrowing economies the money supply is expanded regularly to keep up with the expansion of gross\ndomestic product (GDP). In this dynamic context, expansionary monetary policy can mean an increase in\nthe rate of growth of the money supply, rather than a mere increase in money. However, the money\nmarket model is a nondynamic (or static) model, so we cannot easily incorporate money supply growth\nrates. Nonetheless, we can project the results from this static model to the dynamic world without much\nloss of relevance. (In contrast, any decrease in the money supply or decrease in the growth rate of the\nmoney supply is referred to as contractionary monetary policy.)\nSuppose the money market is originally in equilibrium in Figure 7.3 \"Effects of a Money Supply\nIncrease\" at point A with real money supply MS′/P and interest rate i ′ when the money supply increases,\n$ $\nceteris paribus. The ceteris paribus assumption means we assume that all other exogenous variables in the\nmodel remain fixed at\nFigure 7.3 Effects of a Money Supply Increase\ntheir original levels. In\nthis exercise, it means\nthat real GDP (Y ) and the\n$\nprice level (P ) remain\n$\nfixed. An increase in the\nmoney supply (MS)\ncauses an increase in the\nreal money supply\n(MS/P ) since P remains\n$ $\nconstant. In the diagram,\nthis is shown as a\nrightward shift\n\nfrom MS′/P to MS″/P . At the original interest rate, real money supply has risen to level 2 along the\n$ $\nhorizontal axis while real money demand remains at level 1. This means that money supply exceeds\nmoney demand, and the actual interest rate is higher than the equilibrium rate. Adjustment to the lower\ninterest rate will follow the “interest rate too high” equilibrium story.\nThe final equilibrium will occur at point B on the diagram. The real money supply will have risen from\nlevel 1 to 2 while the equilibrium interest rate has fallen from i ′ to i ″. Thus expansionary monetary policy\n$ $\n(i.e., an increase in the money supply) will cause a decrease in average interest rates in an economy. In\ncontrast, contractionary monetary policy (a decrease in the money supply) will cause an increase in\naverage interest rates in an economy.\nNote this result represents the short-run effect of a money supply increase. The short run is the time\nbefore the money supply can affect the price level in the economy. In Chapter 7 \"Interest Rate\nDetermination\", Section 7.14 \"Money Supply and Long-Run Prices\", we consider the long-run effects of a\nmoney supply increase. In the long run, money supply changes can affect the price level in the economy.\nIn the previous exercise, since the price level remained fixed (i.e., subject to the ceteris paribus\nassumption) when the money supply was increased, this exercise provides the short-run result.",

          "content": "determination.\nThis chapter describes how the supply and demand for the national output of goods and services combine\nto determine the equilibrium level of national output for an economy. The model is called the goods and\nservices market model, or just the G&S market model.\nIn this model, we use gross national product (GNP) as the measure of national output rather than gross\ndomestic product (GDP). This adjustment is made because we wish to define the trade balance (EX − IM)\nas the current account (defined as the difference between exports and imports of goods, services incomes\npayments/receipts, and unilateral transfers). This adjustment is discussed in more detail in Section 8.6\n\"Export and Import Demand\".\nThe diagram used to display this model is commonly known as the Keynesian cross. The model assumes,\nfor simplicity, that the amount of national output produced by an economy is determined by the total\namount demanded. Thus if, for some reason, the demand for GNP were to rise, then the amount of GNP\nsupplied would rise up to satisfy it. If demand for the GNP falls—for whatever reason—then supply of\nGNP would also fall. Consequently, it is useful to think of this model as “demand driven.”\nThe model is developed by identifying the key determinants of GNP demand. The starting point is the\nnational income identity, which states that\nGNP = C + I + G + EX − IM,\nthat is, the gross national product is the sum of consumption expenditures (C), investment expenditures\n(I), government spending (G), and exports (EX) minus imports (IM).\nNote that the identity uses GNP rather than GDP if we define EX and IM to include income payments,\nincome receipts, and unilateral transfers as well as goods and services trade.\nWe rewrite this relationship as\nAD = CD + ID + GD + EXD − IMD,\nwhere AD refers to aggregate demand for the GNP and the right-side variables are now read as\nconsumption demand, investment demand, and so on. The model further assumes that consumption\ndemand is positively related to changes indisposable income (Yd). Furthermore, since disposable income\n\nis in turn negatively related to taxes and positively related to transfer payments, these additional variables\ncan also affect aggregate demand.\nThe model also assumes that demand on the current account (CAD = EXD − IMD) is negatively related to\nchanges in the domestic real currency value (i.e., the real exchange rate) and changes in disposable\nincome. Furthermore, since the domestic real currency value is negatively related to the domestic price\nlevel (inflation) and positively related to the foreign price level, these variables will also affect current\naccount demand.\nUsing the G&S market model, several important relationships between key economic variables are shown:\n• When government demand (G) or investment demand (I) for G&S rises (falls), equilibrium GNP rises\n(falls).\n• When disposable income rises (falls) due to a decrease (increase) in taxes or an increase (decrease) in\ntransfer payments, equilibrium GNP increases (decreases).\n• When the real exchange rate depreciates (appreciates), either due to a depreciation of the nominal\nexchange rate, an increase in the domestic price level, or a decrease in the foreign price level, equilibrium\nGNP rises (falls).\nConnections\nThe G&S market model connects with the money market because the value of GNP determined in the G&S\nmodel affects money demand. If equilibrium GNP rises in the G&S model, then money demand will rise,\ncausing an increase in the interest rate.\nThe G&S model also connects with the foreign exchange (Forex) market. The equilibrium exchange rate\ndetermined in the Forex affects the real exchange rate that in turn influences demand on the current\naccount.\nA thorough discussion of these interrelationships is given in Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\".\nOmissions\nThere is one important relationship omitted in this version of the G&S model, and that is the relationship\nbetween interest rates and investment. In most standard depictions of the Keynesian G&S model, it is\nassumed that increases (decreases) in interest rates will reduce (increase) demand for investment. In this\nversion of the model, to keep things simple, investment is assumed to be exogenous (determined in an\nexternal process) and unrelated to the level of interest rates.\n\nSome approaches further posit that interest rates affect consumption demand as well. This occurs because\nhousehold borrowing, to buy new cars or other consumer items, will tend to rise as interest rates fall.\nHowever, this relationship is also not included in this model.",

          "content": "Consumption demand represents the demand for goods and services by individuals and households in the\neconomy. This is the major category in the national income accounts for most countries, typically\ncomprising from 50 percent to 70 percent of the gross national product (GNP) for most countries.\nIn this model, the main determinant of consumption demand is disposable income. Disposable income is\nall the income households have at their disposal to spend. It is defined as national income (GNP) minus\ntaxes taken away by the government, plus transfer payments that the government pays out to people.\nMore formally, this is written as\nYd = Y − T + TR,\nwhere Yd refers to disposable income, Y is real GNP, T is taxes, and TR represents transfer payments.\nIn this relationship, disposable income is defined in the same way as in the circular flow diagram\npresented in Chapter 2 \"National Income and the Balance of Payments Accounts\", Section 2.7 \"The Twin-\nDeficit Identity\". Recall that taxes withdrawn from GNP are assumed to be all taxes collected by the\ngovernment from all sources. Thus income taxes, social insurance taxes, profit taxes, sales taxes, and\nproperty taxes are all assumed to be included in taxes (T). Also, transfer payments refer to all payments\nmade by the government that do not result in the provision of a good or service. All social insurance\npayments, welfare payments, and unemployment compensation, among other things, are included in\ntransfers (TR).\nIn the G&S model, demand for consumption G&S is assumed to be positively related to disposable\nincome. This means that when disposable income rises, demand for consumption G&S will also rise, and\nvice versa. This makes sense since households who have more money to spend will quite likely wish to buy\nmore G&S.\nWe can write consumption demand in a functional form as follows:\nThis expression says that consumption demand is a function CD that depends positively (+) on disposable\nincome (Yd). The second term simply substitutes the variables that define disposable income in place\n\nof Yd. It is a more complete way of writing the function. Note well that CD here denotes a function, not a\nvariable. The expression is the same as if we had written f(x), but instead we substitute a CD for the f\nand Yd for the x.\nIt is always important to keep track of which variables are exogenous and which are endogenous. In this\nmodel, real GNP (Y) is the key endogenous variable since it will be determined in the equilibrium. Taxes\n(T) and transfer payments (TR) are exogenous variables, determined outside the model. Since\nconsumption demand CD is dependent on the value of Y, which is endogenous, CD is also endogenous. By\nthe same logic, Yd is endogenous as well.\nLinear Consumption Function\nIt is common in most introductory textbooks to present the consumption function in linear form. For our\npurposes here, this is not absolutely necessary, but doing so will allow us to present a few important\npoints.\nIn linear form, the consumption function is written as\nHere C represents autonomous consumption and mpc refers to the marginal propensity to consume.\n0\nAutonomous consumption (C ) is the amount of consumption that would be demanded even if income\n0\nwere zero. (Autonomous simply means “independent” of income.) Graphically, it corresponds to the y-\nintercept of the linear function. Autonomous consumption will be positive since households will spend\nsome money (drawing on savings if necessary) to purchase consumption goods (like food) even if income\nwere zero.\nThe marginal propensity to consume (mpc) represents the additional (or marginal) demand for G&S given\nan additional dollar of disposable income. Graphically, it corresponds to the slope of the consumption\nfunction. This variable must be in the range of zero to one and is most likely to be between 0.5 and 0.8 for\nmost economies. If mpc were equal to one, then households would spend every additional dollar of\nincome. However, because most households put some of their income into savings (i.e., into the bank, or\npensions), not every extra dollar of income will lead to a dollar increase in consumption demand. That\nfraction of the dollar not used for consumption but put into savings is called the\nmarginal propensity to save (mps). Since each additional dollar must be spent or saved, the following\nrelationship must hold:\n\nmpc + mps = 1,\nthat is, the sum of the marginal propensity to consume and the marginal propensity to save must equal 1.",

Think of it as the office and factory space, machinery, computers,\ndesks, and so on that are used to operate a business. It is important to remember that investment demand\nhere does not refer to financial investment. Financial investment is a form of saving, typically by\nhouseholds that wish to maintain or increase their wealth by deferring consumption till a later time.\nIn this model, investment demand will be assumed to be exogenous. This means that its value is\ndetermined outside of the model and is not dependent on any variable within the model. This assumption\nis made primarily to simplify the analysis and to allow the focus to be on exchange rate changes later. The\nsimple equation for investment demand can be written as\nID = I ,\n0\nwhere the “0,” or naught, subscript on the right side indicates that the variable is exogenous or\nautonomous. In words, the equation says that investment demand is given exogenously as I .\n0\nAdmittedly, this is not a realistic assumption. In many other macro models, investment demand is\nassumed to depend on two other aggregate variables: GNP and interest rates. GNP may affect investment\ndemand since the total demand for business expansion is more likely the higher the total size of the\neconomy. The growth rate of GNP may also be an associated determinant since the faster GNP is growing,\nthe more likely companies will predict better business in the future, inspiring more investment.\nInterest rates can affect investment demand because many businesses must borrow money to finance\nexpansions. The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money; thus, the higher the interest rates are, the\nlower the investment demand should be, and vice versa.\nIf we included the GNP and interest rate effects into the model, the solution to the extended model later\nwould prove to be much more difficult. Thus we simplify things by assuming that investment is\nexogenous.

          "content": "variables.\nExport demand refers to the demand by foreign countries for G&S produced domestically. Ultimately,\nthese goods are exported to foreign residents. Import demand refers to demand by domestic residents for\nforeign-produced G&S. Imported G&S are not a part of domestic GNP. Recall from Chapter 2 \"National\nIncome and the Balance of Payments Accounts\", Section 2.3 \"U.S. National Income Statistics (2007–\n2008)\"that imports are subtracted from the national income identity because they are included as a part\nof consumption, investment, and government expenditures as well as in exports. Likewise in this model,\nconsumption, investment, government, and export demand are assumed to include demand for imported\ngoods. Thus imports must be subtracted to assure that only domestically produced G&S are included.\nWe will define current account demand as CAD = EXD − IMD. The key determinants of current account\ndemand in this model are assumed to be the domestic real currency value and disposable income.\nFirst, let’s define the real currency value, then show how it relates to the demand for exports and imports.\nThe real British pound value in terms of U.S. dollars (also called the real exchange rate between dollars\nand pounds), RE , is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods abroad relative to the cost of a\n$/£\nsimilar basket domestically. It captures differences in prices, converted at the spot exchange rate, between\nthe domestic country and the rest of the world. It is defined as\nwhere E is the spot exchange rate, CB is the cost of a market basket of goods in Britain, and CB is the\n$/£ £ $\ncost of a comparable basket of goods in the United States. The top expression, E CB , represents the\n$/£ £\ncost of a British market basket of goods converted to U.S. dollars. Thus if RE > 1, then a British basket\n$/£\nof goods costs more than a comparable U.S. basket of goods. If RE < 1, then a U.S. basket of goods costs\n$/£\nmore than a British basket. Also note that RE is a unit less number. If RE = 2, for example, it means\n$/£ $/£\nthat British goods cost twice as much as U.S. goods, on average, at the current spot exchange rate.\nNote that we could also have defined the reciprocal real exchange rate, RE . This real exchange rate is\n£/$\nthe real value of the pound in terms of U.S. dollars. Since the real exchange rate can be defined in two\n\nseparate ways between any two currencies, it can be confusing to say things like “the real exchange rate\nrises” since the listener may not know which real exchange rate the speaker has in mind. Thus it is always\npreferable to say the real dollar value rises, or the real pound value falls, since this eliminates any\npotential confusion. In this text, I will always adhere to the convention of writing the spot exchange rate\nand the real exchange rate with the U.S. dollar in the numerator. Thus references to the real exchange rate\nin this text will always refer to that form.\nSince the cost of a market basket of goods is used to create a country’s price index, changes in CB will\nmove together with changes in the country’s price level P. For this reason, it is common to rewrite the real\nexchange rate using price levels rather than costs of market baskets and to continue to interpret the\nexpression in the same way. For more information related to this, see Chapter 6 \"Purchasing Power\nParity\", Section 6.2 \"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and PPP\". We will follow that convention here and\nrewrite RE as\n$/£\nwhere P is the British price index and P is the U.S. price index. From this point forward, we’ll mean this\n£ $\nexpression whenever we discuss the real exchange rate.\nNext, we’ll discuss the connection to current account demand. To understand the relationship it is best to\nconsider a change in the real exchange rate. Suppose RE rises. This means that the real value of the\n$/£\npound rises and, simultaneously, the real U.S. dollar value falls. This also means that goods and services\nare becoming relatively more expensive, on average, in Britain compared to the United States.\nRelatively cheaper G&S in the United States will tend to encourage U.S. exports since the British would\nprefer to buy some cheaper products in the United States. Similarly, relatively more expensive British\nG&S will tend to discourage U.S. imports from Britain. Since U.S. exports will rise and imports will fall\nwith an increase in the real U.S. dollar value, current account demand, CAD = EXD − IMD, will rise.\nSimilarly, if the real U.S. dollar value falls, U.S. exports will fall and imports rise, causing a decrease\nin CAD. Hence, there is a positive relationship between this real exchange rate (i.e., the real value of the\npound) and U.S. current account demand.\nDisposable income can also affect the current account demand. In this case, the effect is through imports.\nAn increase in disposable income means that households have more money to spend. Some fraction of\n\nthis will be consumed, the marginal propensity to consume, and some fraction of that consumption will be\nfor imported goods. Thus an increase in disposable income should result in an increase in imports and a\nsubsequent reduction in current account demand. Thus changes in disposable income are negatively\nrelated to current account demand.\nWe can write current account demand in functional form as follows:\nThe expression indicates that current account demand is a function of RE and Yd. The “+” sign\n$/£\nabove RE indicates the positive relationship between the real exchange rate (as defined) and current\n$/£\naccount demand. The “−” sign above the disposable income term indicates a negative relationship with\ncurrent account demand.",

This would\nseem to make ambiguous the effect of a disposable income change on aggregate demand. However, by\nthinking carefully about the circular flow definitions, we can recall that consumption expenditures consist\nof the sum of expenditures on domestically produced goods and imported goods. This was the reason\nimports are subtracted away in the national income identity. This also means that the marginal propensity\nto spend on imported goods must be lower than the total marginal propensity to consume, again since\nimports are a fraction of total consumption spending. This implies that the negative effect on imports\nfrom a $1 increase in disposable income must be less than the positive impact on consumption demand.\nWe indicate the net positive effect on aggregate demand of changes in disposable income with the “+” sign\nabove Yd on the left-hand side. The positive impact of changes in the real exchange rate, investment\ndemand, and government demand is obvious and is also shown.\nWe can write the aggregate demand function in several different ways.

          "content": "The Keynesian cross diagram depicts the equilibrium level of national income in the G&S market model.\nWe begin with a plot of the aggregate demand function with respect to real GNP (Y) in . Real GNP (Y) is\nplotted along the horizontal axis, and aggregate demand is measured along the vertical axis. The aggregate\ndemand function is shown as the upward sloping line labeled AD(Y, …). The (…) is meant to indicate\nthat AD is a function of many other variables not listed. There are several important assumptions about\nthe form of the AD function that are needed to assure an equilibrium. We discuss each assumption in\nturn.\nFirst, the AD function is\nFigure 8.1 Aggregate Demand Function\npositively sloped with\nrespect to changes in Y,\nceteris paribus. Recall that\nceteris paribus means that\nall other variables affecting\naggregate demand are\nassumed to remain constant\nas GNP changes. The\npositive slope arises from\nthe rationale given\npreviously that an increase\nin disposable income should\nnaturally lead to an increase in consumption demand and a smaller decrease in CA demand, resulting in a\nnet increase in aggregate demand. Next, if GNP rises, ceteris paribus, it means that taxes and transfer\npayments remain fixed and disposable income must increase. Thus an increase in GNP leads to an\nincrease in AD.\nSecond, the AD function has a positive vertical intercept term. In other words, the AD function crosses the\nvertical axis at a level greater than zero. For reasons that are not too important, this feature is critical for\n\ngenerating the equilibrium later. The reason it arises is because autonomous consumption, investment,\nand government demand are all assumed to be independent of income and positive in value. These\nassumptions guarantee a positive vertical intercept.\nThird, the AD function has a slope that is less than one. This assumption means that for every $1 increase\nin GNP (Y), there is a less than $1 increase in aggregate demand. This arises because the marginal\npropensity to consume domestic GNP is less than one for two reasons. First, some of the additional\nincome will be spent on imported goods, and second, some of the additional income will be saved. Thus\nthe AD function will have a slope less than one.\nAlso plotted in the diagram is a line labeled AD = Y. This line is also sometimes called the forty-five-\ndegree line since it sits at a forty-five-degree angle to the horizontal axis. This line represents all the points\non the diagram where AD equals GNP. Since GNP can be thought of as aggregate supply, the forty-five-\ndegree line contains all the points where AD equals aggregate supply.\nBecause of the assumptions about the shape and position of the AD function, AD will cross the forty-five-\ndegree line, only once, from above. The intersection determines the equilibrium value of GNP, labeled Y′\nin the diagram.",

          "content": "its equilibrium value.\nAny equilibrium in economics has an associated behavioral story to explain the forces that will move the\nendogenous variable to the equilibrium value. In the G&S market model, the endogenous variable is Y,\nreal GNP. This is the variable that will change to achieve the equilibrium. Variables that do not change in\nthe adjustment to the equilibrium are the exogenous variables. In this model, the exogenous variables\nare I ,G , T, TR, E , P , and P . (If one uses a linear consumption demand function, theC and mpc are\n0 0 $/£ $ £ 0\nalso exogenous.) Changes in the exogenous variables are necessary to cause an adjustment to a new\nequilibrium. However, in telling an equilibrium story, it is typical to simply assume that the endogenous\nvariable is not at the equilibrium (for some unstated reason) and then to explain how and why the variable\nwill adjust to the equilibrium value.\nGNP Too High\nSuppose for some reason actual GNP, Y, is higher than the equilibrium GNP, Y′, as shown in Figure 8.2\n1\n\"G&S Market Adjustment to Equilibrium: GNP Too High\". In this case, aggregate demand is read from\nthe AD function as AD(Y) along the vertical axis. We project aggregate supply, Y, to the vertical axis using\n1 1\nthe forty-five-degree line so that we can\nFigure 8.2 G&S Market Adjustment to Equilibrium: GNP\ncompare supply with demand. This\nToo High\nhelps us to see that Y > AD(Y)—that is,\n1 1\naggregate supply is greater than\naggregate demand.\nWe now tell what can be called the\n“Inventory Story.” When total demand is\nless than supply, goods will begin to pile\nup on the shelves in stores. That’s\nbecause at current prices (and all other\nfixed exogenous parameters),\nhouseholds, businesses, and\n\ngovernment would prefer to buy less than what is available for sale. Thus inventories begin to rise.\nMerchants, faced with storerooms filling up, send orders for fewer goods to producers. Producers respond\nto fewer orders by producing less, and thus GNP begins to fall.\nAs GNP falls, disposable income also falls, which causes a drop in aggregate demand as well. In the\ndiagram, this is seen as a movement along the AD curve from Y to Y′. However, GNP falls at a faster rate,\n1\nalong the AD = Y line in the diagram. Eventually, the drop in aggregate supply catches up to the drop in\ndemand when the equilibrium is reached at Y′. At this point, aggregate demand equals aggregate supply\nand there is no longer an accumulation of inventories.\nIt is important to recognize a common perception or intuition that does not hold in the equilibrium\nadjustment process. Many students imagine a case of rising inventories and ask, “Won’t producers just\nlower their prices to get rid of the excess?” In real-world situations this will frequently happen; however,\nthat response violates the ceteris paribus assumption of this model. We assume here that the U.S. price\nlevel (P ) and consequently all prices in the economy remain fixed in the adjustment to the new\n$\nequilibrium. Later, with more elaborate versions of the model, some price flexibility is considered.\nGNP Too Low\nSuppose for some reason, actual Figure 8.3 G&S Market Adjustment to Equilibrium: GNP Too Low\nGNP, Y , is lower than the\n2\nequilibrium GNP, Y′, as shown\nin Figure 8.3 \"G&S Market\nAdjustment to Equilibrium:\nGNP Too Low\". In this case,\naggregate demand is read from\nthe AD function as AD(Y ) along\n2\nthe vertical axis. We project\naggregate supply (Y ) to the\n2\nvertical axis using the forty-five-\ndegree line. This shows that AD(Y) > Y—that is, aggregate demand is greater than aggregate supply.\n2 2\nWhen total demand exceeds supply, inventories of goods that had previously been accumulated will begin\nto deplete in stores. That’s because, at current prices (and all other fixed exogenous parameters),\n\nhouseholds, businesses, and government would prefer to buy more than is needed to keep stocks at a\nconstant level. Merchants, faced with depleted inventories and the possibility of running out of goods to\nsell, send orders to producers for greater quantities of goods. Producers respond to more orders by\nproducing more and thus GNP begins to rise.\nAs GNP rises, disposable income also rises, which causes an increase in aggregate demand as well. In the\ndiagram, this is seen as a movement along the AD curve fromY to Y′. However, GNP rises at a faster rate,\n2\nalong the AD = Y line in the diagram. Eventually, the increase in aggregate supply catches up to the\nincrease in demand when the equilibrium is reached at Y′. At this point, aggregate demand equals\naggregate supply and there is no further depletion of inventories.",

The AA-DD model\nrepresents a synthesis of the three previous market models: the foreign exchange (Forex) market, the\nmoney market, and the goods and services market. In a sense, there is really very little new information\npresented here. Instead, the chapter provides a graphical approach to integrate the results from the three\nmodels and to show their interconnectedness. However, because so much is going on simultaneously,\nworking with the AA-DD model can be quite challenging.\nThe AA-DD model is described with a diagram consisting of two curves (or lines): an\nAA curve representing asset market equilibriums derived from the money market and foreign exchange\nmarkets and a DD curve representing goods market (or demand) equilibriums. The intersection of the two\ncurves identifies a market equilibrium in which each of the three markets is simultaneously in\nequilibrium. Thus we refer to this equilibrium as a superequilibrium.\nResults\nThe main results of this section are descriptive and purely mechanical. The chapter describes the\nderivation of the AA and DD curves, explains how changes in exogenous variables will cause shifts in the\ncurves, and explains adjustment from one equilibrium to another.\na. The DD curve is the set of exchange rate and GNP combinations that maintain equilibrium in the\ngoods and services market, given fixed values for all other exogenous variables.\nb. The DD curve shifts rightward whenever government demand (G), investment demand (I), transfer\npayments (TR), or foreign prices (P ) increase or when taxes (T) or domestic prices (P ) decrease.\n£ $\nChanges in the opposite direction cause a leftward shift.\nc. The AA curve is the set of exchange rate and GNP combinations that maintain equilibrium in the asset\nmarkets, given fixed values for all other exogenous variables.\nd. The AA curve shifts upward whenever money supply (MS), foreign interest rates (i ), or the expected\n£\nexchange rate (E e) increase or when domestic prices (P ) decrease. Changes in the opposite direction\n$/£ $\ncause a downward shift.\n\ne. The intersection of the AA and DD curves depicts a superequilibrium in an economy since at that point\nthe goods and services market, the domestic money market, and the foreign exchange market are all in\nequilibrium simultaneously.\nf. Changes in any exogenous variable that is not plotted on the axes (anything but Y and E ) will cause a\n$/£\nshift of the AA or DD curves and move the economy out of equilibrium, temporarily. Adjustment to a new\nequilibrium follows the principle that adjustment in the asset markets occurs much more rapidly than\nadjustment in the goods and services market. Thus adjustment to the AA curve will always occur before\nadjustment to the DD curve.\nConnections\nThe AA-DD model will allow us to understand how changes in macroeconomic policy—both monetary and\nfiscal—can affect key aggregate economic variables when a country is open to international trade and\nfinancial flows while accounting for the interaction of the variables among themselves. Specifically, the\nmodel is used to identify potential effects of fiscal and monetary policy on exchange rates, trade balances,\nGDP levels, interest rates, and price levels both domestically and abroad. In subsequent chapters, analyses\nwill be done under both floating and fixed exchange rate regimes.\nexercises using the AA-DD model allow one to identify the effects of changes\nin exogenous variables on the level of GDP and the exchange rate, while assuring that the Forex,\nthe money market, and the G&S market all achieve simultaneous equilibrium.",

          "content": "The DD curve is derived by transferring information described in the goods and services (G&S) market\nmodel onto a new diagram to show the relationship between the exchange rate and equilibrium gross\nnational product (GNP). The original G&S market, depicted in the top part of , plots the aggregate\ndemand (AD) function with respect to changes in U.S. GNP (Y ). Aggregate demand is measured along the\n$\nvertical axis and aggregate supply (or the GNP) is measured on the horizontal axis. As discussed in , , the\nAD function is dependent upon several different exogenous variables, most notably the exchange rate\nbetween domestic and foreign currency (E ). However, AD is also affected by investment demand (I),\n$/£\ngovernment demand (G), government tax revenues (T), government transfer payments (TR), and the\nprice level in the domestic (P ) and foreign (P ) countries. The endogenous variable in the model is U.S.\n$ £\nGNP (Y ). (See for a quick reference.) In this exercise, since our focus is on the exchange rate, we label the\n$\nAD function in as AD(E , …), where the ellipsis (…) is meant to indicate there are other unspecified\n$/£\nvariables that also influence AD.\nTable 9.1 G&S Market\nExogenous Variables E , I, G, T, TR, P, P\n$/£ $ £\nEndogenous Variable Y\n$\nInitially, let’s assume the exchange rate is at a value in the market given by E $/*1. We need to remember that all the\nother variables that affect AD are also at some initial level. Written explicitly, we could write AD\nas AD(E $/£1, I1, G1, T1, TR1, P $1, P £1). The AD function with exchange rate E $/£1 intersects the forty-five-degree line at\npoint Gwhich determines the equilibrium level of GNP given by Y $1. These two values are transferred to the lower\ndiagram at point G determining one point on the DD curve (Y $1, E $/£1).\n\nFigure 9.1 Derivation of the DD Curve Next, suppose E $/£ rises from E $/£1 to E $/£2, ceteris\nparibus. This corresponds to a depreciation of the U.S.\ndollar with respect to the British pound. The ceteris\nparibus assumption means that investment,\ngovernment, taxes, and so on stay fixed at\nlevelsI1, G1, T1, and so on. Since a dollar depreciation\nmakes foreign G&S relatively more expensive and\ndomestic goods relatively cheaper, AD shifts up\nto AD(E $/£2, …). The equilibrium shifts to point H at a\nGNP level Y $2. These two values are transferred to the\nlower diagram at point H, determining a second point\non the DD curve (Y $2, E $/£2).\nThe line drawn through points G and H on the lower\ndiagram is called the DD curve. The DD curve plots an\nequilibrium GNP level for every possible exchange\nrate that may prevail, ceteris paribus. Stated\ndifferently, the DD curve is the combination of\nexchange rates and GNP levels that maintain\nequilibrium in the G&S market, ceteris paribus. We\ncan think of it as the set of aggregate demand\nequilibriums.\nA Note about Equilibriums\nAn equilibrium in an economic model typically\ncorresponds to a point toward which the endogenous variable values will converge based on some\nbehavioral assumption about the participants in the model. In this case, equilibrium is not represented by\na single point. Instead every point along the DD curve is an equilibrium value.\nIf the economy were at a point above the DD curve, say, at I in the lower diagram, the exchange rate would\nbe E $/£2 and the GNP level at Y $1. This corresponds to point I in the upper diagram where AD > Y, read off\nthe vertical axis. In the G&S model, whenever aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, producers\n\nrespond by increasing supply, causing GNP to rise. This continues until AD = Y at point H. For all points\nto the left of the DD curve, AD > Y, therefore the behavior of producers would cause a shift to the right\nfrom any point like I to a point like H on the DD curve.\nSimilarly, at a point such as J, to the right of the DD curve, the exchange rate is E $/£1and the GNP level is\nat Y $2. This corresponds to point J in the upper diagram above where aggregate demand is less than supply\n(AD < Y). In the G&S model, whenever\nFigure 9.2 A 3-D DD Curve\nsupply exceeds demand, producers respond\nby reducing supply, thus GNP falls. This\ncontinues until AD = Y at point G. For all\npoints to the right of the DD curve, AD < Y,\ntherefore the behavior of producers would\ncause a shift to the left from any point\nlike Jto a point like G on the DD curve.\nA useful analogy is to think of the DD curve\nas a river flowing through a valley. (See the\n3-D diagram in .) The hills rise up to the\nright and left along the upward-sloping DD\ncurve. Just as gravity will move a drop of water downhill onto the river valley, firm behavior will move\nGNP much in the same way: right or left to the lowest point along the DD curve.",

The exogenous variable assumed to change is\nthe exchange rate. The endogenous variable affected is the gross national product (GNP).

          "content": "This chapter uses the AA-DD model to describe the effects of fiscal and monetary policy under a system of\nfloating exchange rates. Fiscal and monetary policies are the primary tools governments use to guide the\nmacroeconomy. In introductory macroeconomics courses, students learn how fiscal and monetary policy\nlevers can be used to influence the level of gross national product (GNP), the inflation rate, the\nunemployment rate, and interest rates. In this chapter, that analysis is expanded to an open economy (i.e.,\none open to trade) and to the effects on exchange rates and current account balances.\nResults\nUsing the AA-DD model, several important relationships between key economic variables are shown:\n• Expansionary monetary policy (↑MS) causes an increase in GNP and a depreciation of the domestic\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system in the short run.\n• Contractionary monetary policy (↓MS) causes a decrease in GNP and an appreciation of the domestic\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system in the short run.\n• Expansionary fiscal policy (↑G, ↑TR, or ↓T) causes an increase in GNP and an appreciation of the domestic\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system.\n• Contractionary fiscal policy (↓G, ↓TR, or ↑T) causes a decrease in GNP and a depreciation of the domestic\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system.\n• In the long run, once inflation effects are included, expansionary monetary policy (↑MS) in a full\nemployment economy causes no long-term change in GNP and a depreciation of the domestic currency in\na floating exchange rate system. In the transition, the exchange rate overshoots its long-run target and\nGNP rises then falls.\n• A sterilized foreign exchange intervention will have no effect on GNP or the exchange rate in the AA-DD\nmodel, unless international investors adjust their expected future exchange rate in response.\n• A central bank can influence the exchange rate with direct Forex interventions (buying or selling domestic\ncurrency in exchange for foreign currency). To sell foreign currency and buy domestic currency, the\ncentral bank must have a stockpile of foreign currency reserves.\n\n• A central bank can also influence the exchange rate with indirect open market operations (buying or\nselling domestic treasury bonds). These transactions work through money supply changes and their effect\non interest rates.\n• Purchases (sales) of foreign currency on the Forex will raise (lower) the domestic money supply and cause\na secondary indirect effect upon the exchange rate.\nConnections\nThe AA-DD model was developed to describe the interrelationships of macroeconomic variables within an\nopen economy. Since some of these macroeconomic variables are controlled by the government, we can\nuse the model to understand the likely effects of government policy changes. The two main levers the\ngovernment controls are monetary policy (changes in the money supply) and fiscal policy (changes in the\ngovernment budget). In this chapter, the AA-DD model is applied to understand government policy\neffects in the context of a floating exchange rate system. In , we’ll revisit these same government policies\nin the context of a fixed exchange rate system.\nIt is important to recognize that these results are what “would” happen under the full set of assumptions\nthat describe the AA-DD model. These effects may or may not happen in reality. Despite this problem, the\nmodel surely captures some of the simple cause-and-effect relationships and therefore helps us to\nunderstand the broader implications of policy changes. Thus even if in reality many more elements not\ndescribed in the model may act to influence the key endogenous variables, the AA-DD model at least gives\na more complete picture of some of the expected tendencies.",

Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the foreign exchange market, and the\nG&S market.\nIn this section, we use the AA-DD model to assess the effects of monetary policy in a floating exchange\nrate system. Recall from Chapter 7 \"Interest Rate Determination\"that the money supply is effectively\ncontrolled by a country’s central bank. In the case of the United States, this is the Federal Reserve Board,\nor the Fed for short. When the money supply increases due to action taken by the central bank, we refer to\nit as expansionary monetary policy. If the central bank acts to reduce the money supply, it is referred to as\ncontractionary monetary policy. Methods that can be used to change the money supply are discussed\nin Chapter 7 \"Interest Rate Determination\", Section 7.5 \"Controlling the Money Supply\".\nExpansionary Monetary Policy\nSuppose the economy is originally at a\nFigure 10.1 Expansionary Monetary Policy in the AA-DD\nsuperequilibrium shown as\nModel with Floating Exchange Rates\npoint F in Figure 10.1 \"Expansionary\nMonetary Policy in the AA-DD Model\nwith Floating Exchange Rates\". The\noriginal GNP level is Y1 and the\nexchange rate is E $/£1. Next, suppose\nthe U.S. central bank (or the Fed)\ndecides to expand the money supply.\nAs shown inChapter 9 \"The AA-DD\nModel\", Section 9.5 \"Shifting the AA\nCurve\", money supply changes cause a\nshift in the AA curve. More\nspecifically, an increase in the money\n\nsupply will cause AA to shift upward (i.e., ↑MS is an AA up-shifter). This is depicted in the diagram as a\nshift from the red AA to the blue A′A′ line.\nThere are several different levels of detail that can be provided to describe the effects of this policy. Below,\nwe present three descriptions with increasing degrees of completeness. First the quick result, then the\nquick result with the transition process described, and finally the complete adjustment story.\nQuick Result\nThe increase in AA causes a shift in the superequilibrium point from F to H. In adjusting to the new\nequilibrium at H, GNP rises from Y1 to Y2 and the exchange rate increases from E $/£1 to E $/£2. The increase\nin the exchange rate represents an increase in the British pound value and a decrease in the U.S. dollar\nvalue. In other words, it is an appreciation of the pound and a depreciation of the dollar. Since the final\nequilibrium point H is above the initial iso-CAB line CC, the current account balance increases.\n(See Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.8 \"AA-DD and the Current Account Balance\" for a\ndescription of CC.) If the CAB were in surplus at F, then the surplus increases; if the CAB were in deficit,\nthen the deficit falls. Thus U.S. expansionary monetary policy causes an increase in GNP, a depreciation of\nthe U.S. dollar, and an increase in the current account balance in a floating exchange rate system\naccording to the AA-DD model.\nTransition Description\nConsider the upward shift of the AA curve due to the increase in the money supply. Since exchange rates\nadjust much more rapidly than GNP, the economy will initially adjust back to the new A′A′ curve before\nany change in GNP occurs. That means the first adjustment will be from point F to point G directly above.\nThe exchange rate will increase from E $/£1 to E $/£1′, representing a depreciation of the U.S. dollar.\nNow at point G, the economy lies to the left of the DD curve. Thus GNP will begin to rise to get back to\ngoods and services (G&S) market equilibrium on the DD curve. However, as GNP rises, the economy\nmoves to the right above the A′A′ curve, which forces a downward readjustment of the exchange rate to get\nback to A′A′. In the end, the economy will adjust in a stepwise fashion from point G to point H, with each\nrightward movement in GNP followed by a quick reduction in the exchange rate to remain on the A′A′\ncurve. This process will continue until the economy reaches the superequilibrium at point H.\n\nNotice that in the transition the exchange rate first rises to E $/£1′. Above the rate it will ultimately\nreach E $/£2 before settling back to superequilibrium value. This is an example of exchange rate\novershooting. In the transition, the exchange rateovershoots its ultimate long-run value.\nExchange rate overshooting is used as one explanation for the volatility of exchange rates in floating\nmarkets. If many small changes occur frequently in an economy, the economy may always be in transition\nmoving to a superequilibrium. Because of the more rapid adjustment of exchange rates, it is possible that\nmany episodes of overshooting—both upward and downward—can occur in a relatively short period.\nComplete Adjustment Story\nStep 1: When the money supply increases, real money supply will exceed real money demand in the\neconomy. Since households and businesses hold more money than they would like, at current interest\nrates, they begin to convert liquid money assets into less-liquid nonmoney assets. This raises the supply of\nlong-term deposits and the amount of funds available for banks to loan. More money to lend will lower\naverage U.S. interest rates, which in turn will result in a lower U.S. rate of return in the Forex market.\nSince RoR < ROR now, there will be an immediate increase in the demand for foreign British currency,\n$ £\nthus causing an appreciation of the pound and a depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Thus the exchange rate\n(E ) rises. This change is represented by the movement from point F to G on the AA-DD diagram. The AA\n$/£\ncurve has shifted up to reflect the new set of asset market equilbria corresponding to the higher U.S.\nmoney supply. Since the money market and foreign exchange (Forex) markets adjust very swiftly to the\nmoney supply change, the economy will not remain off the new A′A′ curve for very long.\nStep 2: Now that the exchange rate has risen to E $/£1′, the real exchange has also increased. This implies\nforeign goods and services are relatively more expensive while U.S. G&S are relatively cheaper. This will\nraise demand for U.S. exports, curtail demand for U.S. imports, and result in an increase in current\naccount and, thereby, aggregate demand. Because aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply,\ninventories will begin to fall, stimulating an increase in production and thus GNP. This is represented by a\nrightward shift from point G.\nStep 3: As GNP rises, so does real money demand, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates. With higher\ninterest rates, the rate of return on U.S. assets rises above that in the United Kingdom, and international\ninvestors shift funds back to the United States, resulting in a dollar appreciation (pound depreciation)—\nthat is, a decrease in the exchange rate (E ). This moves the economy downward, back to the A′A′ curve.\n$/£\n\nThe adjustment in the asset market will occur quickly after the change in interest rates. Thus the\nrightward shift from point G in the diagram results in quick downward adjustment to regain equilibrium\nin the asset market on the A′A′ curve, as shown in the figure.\nStep 4: Continuing increases in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing increases\nin U.S. interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise process above until the new equilibrium is\nreached at point H in the diagram.\nStep 5: The equilibrium at H lies to the northeast of F along the original DD curve. As shown in Chapter 9\n\"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.8 \"AA-DD and the Current Account Balance\", the equilibrium at H lies\nabove the original iso-CAB line. Therefore, the current account balance will rise.\nContractionary Monetary Policy\nContractionary monetary policy corresponds to a decrease in the money supply. In the AA-DD model, a\ndecrease in the money supply shifts the AA curve downward. The effects will be the opposite of those\ndescribed above for expansionary monetary policy. A complete description is left for the reader as an\nexercise.\nThe quick effects, however, are as follows. U.S. contractionary monetary policy will cause a reduction in\nGNP and a reduction in the exchange rate, E , implying an appreciation of the U.S. dollar and a decrease\n$/£\nin the current account balance.",

Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the Forex market, and the G&S\nmarket.\nIn this section, we use the AA-DD model to assess the effects of fiscal policy in a floating exchange rate\nsystem. Recall that fiscal policy refers to any change in expenditures or revenues within any branch of the\ngovernment. This means any change in government spending—transfer payments, or taxes, by either\nfederal, state, or local governments—represents a fiscal policy change. Since changes in expenditures or\nrevenues will often affect a government budget balance, we can also say that a change in the government\nsurplus or deficit represents a change in fiscal policy.\nWhen government spending or transfer payments increase, or tax revenues decrease, we refer to it as\nexpansionary fiscal policy. These actions would also be associated with an increase in the government\nbudget deficit or a decrease in its budget\nFigure 10.2 Expansionary Fiscal Policy in the AA-DD\nsurplus. If the government acts to reduce\nModel with Floating Exchange Rates\ngovernment spending or transfer\npayments, or increase tax revenues, it is\nreferred to as contractionary fiscal policy.\nThese actions would also be\nassociated with a decrease in the\ngovernment budget deficit, or an\nincrease in its budget surplus.\nExpansionary Fiscal Policy\nSuppose the economy is originally at a\nsuperequilibrium shown as\npoint J in Figure 10.2 \"Expansionary Fiscal\nPolicy in the AA-DD Model with\nFloating Exchange Rates\". The original\n\ngross national product (GNP) level is Y1 and the exchange rate is E $/£1. Next, suppose the government\ndecides to increase government spending (or increase transfer payments or decrease taxes). As shown\nin Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\",Section 9.3 \"Shifting the DD Curve\", fiscal policy changes cause a shift\nin the DD curve. More specifically, an increase in government spending (or an increase in transfer\npayments or a decrease in taxes) will cause DD to shift rightward (i.e., ↑G, ↑TR, and ↓T all are DD right-\nshifters). This is depicted in the diagram as a shift from the red DD to the blue D′D′ line.\nThere are several different levels of detail that can be provided to describe the effects of this policy. Below,\nwe present three descriptions with increasing degrees of completeness: first the quick result, then the\nquick result with the transition process described, and finally the complete adjustment story.\nQuick Result\nThe increase in DD causes a shift in the superequilibrium point from J to K. In adjusting to the new\nequilibrium at K, GNP rises from Y1 to Y2 and the exchange rate decreases from E $/£1 to E $/£2. The decrease\nin the exchange represents a decrease in the British pound value and an increase in the U.S. dollar value.\nIn other words, it is a depreciation of the pound and an appreciation of the dollar. Since the final\nequilibrium point K is below the initial iso-CAB line CC, the current account balance decreases. (Caveat:\nthis will be true for all fiscal expansions, but the iso-CAB line can only be used with an increase in G;\nsee Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.8 \"AA-DD and the Current Account Balance\" for an\nexplanation.) If the CAB were in surplus at J, then the surplus decreases; if the CAB were in deficit, then\nthe deficit rises. Thus the U.S. expansionary fiscal policy causes an increase in the U.S. GNP, an\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar, and a decrease in the current account balance in a floating exchange rate\nsystem according to the AA-DD model.\nTransition Description\nIf the expansionary fiscal policy occurs because of an increase in government spending, then government\ndemand for goods and services (G&S) will increase. If the expansionary fiscal policy occurs due to an\nincrease in transfer payments or a decrease in taxes, then disposable income will increase, leading to an\nincrease in consumption demand. In either case aggregate demand increases, and this causes the\nrightward shift in the DD curve. Immediately after aggregate demand increases, but before any\nadjustment has occurred at point J, the economy lies to the left of the new D´D´ curve. Thus GNP will\nbegin to rise to get back to G&S market equilibrium on the D´D´ curve. However, as GNP rises, the\n\neconomy will move above the AA curve, forcing a downward readjustment of the exchange rate to get back\nto asset market equilibrium on the AA curve. In the end, the economy will adjust in a stepwise fashion\nfrom point Jto point K, with each rightward movement in GNP followed by a quick reduction in the\nexchange rate to remain on the AA curve. This process will continue until the economy reaches the\nsuperequilibrium at point K.\nComplete Adjustment Story\nStep 1: If the expansionary fiscal policy occurs because of an increase in government spending, then\ngovernment demand for G&S will increase. If the expansionary fiscal policy occurs due to an increase in\ntransfer payments or a decrease in taxes, then disposable income will increase, leading to an increase in\nconsumption demand. In either case aggregate demand increases. Before any adjustment occurs, the\nincrease in aggregate demand implies aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, which will lead to a\ndecline in inventories. To prevent this decline, retailers (or government suppliers) will signal firms to\nproduce more. As supply increases so does the GNP, and the economy moves to the right of point J.\nStep 2: As GNP rises, so does real money demand, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates. With higher\ninterest rates, the rate of return on U.S. assets rises above that in the United Kingdom and international\ninvestors shift funds back to the United States, resulting in a dollar appreciation (pound depreciation)—\nthat is, a decrease in the exchange rate E . This moves the economy downward, back to the AA curve. The\n$/£\nadjustment in the asset market will occur quickly after the change in interest rates. Thus the rightward\nshift from point J in the diagram results in quick downward adjustment to regain equilibrium in the asset\nmarket on the AA curve, as shown.\nStep 3: Continuing increases in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing increases\nin U.S. interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise process above until the new equilibrium is\nreached at point K in the diagram.\nStep 4: The equilibrium at K lies to the southeast of J along the original AA curve. As shown in Chapter 9\n\"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.8 \"AA-DD and the Current Account Balance\", the current account balance\nmust be lower at K since both an increase in GNP and a dollar appreciation cause decreases in current\naccount demand. Thus the equilibrium at K lies below the original iso-CAB line. However, this is only\nassured if the fiscal expansion occurred due to an increase in G.\n\nIf transfer payments increased or taxes were reduced, these would both increase disposable income and\nlead to a further decline in the current account balance. Thus also with these types of fiscal expansions,\nthe current account balance is reduced; however, one cannot use the iso-CAB line to show it.\nContractionary Fiscal Policy\nContractionary fiscal policy corresponds to a decrease in government spending, a decrease in transfer\npayments, or an increase in taxes. It would also be represented by a decrease in the government budget\ndeficit or an increase in the budget surplus. In the AA-DD model, a contractionary fiscal policy shifts the\nDD curve leftward. The effects will be the opposite of those described above for expansionary fiscal policy.\nA complete description is left for the reader as an exercise.\nThe quick effects, however, are as follows. U.S. contractionary fiscal policy will cause a reduction in GNP\nand an increase in the exchange rate (E ), implying a depreciation of the U.S. dollar.\n$/£",

Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the Forex market, and the G&S\nmarket.\nIf expansionary monetary policy occurs when the economy is operating at full employment output, then\nthe money supply increase will eventually put upward pressure on prices. Thus we say that eventually, or\nin the long run, the aggregate price level will rise and the economy will experience an episode of inflation\nin the transition. See , for a complete description of this process.\nHere, we will describe the long-run effects of an increase in the money supply using the AA-DD model. We\nbreak up the effects into short-run and long-run components. In the short run, the initial money supply\neffects are felt and investor anticipations about future effects are implemented. In the long run, we allow\nthe price level to rise.\nFigure 10.3 Expansionary Monetary Policy in the\nSuppose the economy is originally at a\nLong Run\nsuperequilibrium, shown as\npoint F in . The original GNP level is YF,\nand the exchange rate\nis E1. YF represents the full-\nemployment level of output, which also\nimplies that the natural rate of\nunemployment prevails. Any\nmovement of the economy to the right\nof YF will cause an eventual increase in the\naggregate price level. Any movement to the\nleft of YF causes an eventual decrease in the\nprice level.\n\nNext, suppose the U.S. central bank (or the Fed) decides to expand the money supply. As shown in , ,\nmoney supply changes cause a shift in the AA curve. More specifically, an increase in the money supply\nwill cause AA to shift upward (i.e., ↑MS is an AA up-shifter). This is depicted in the diagram as a shift\nfrom the AA line to the red A′A′ line.\nIn the long-run adjustment story, several different changes in exogenous variables will occur sequentially,\nthus it is difficult to describe the quick final result, so we will only describe the transition process in\npartial detail.\nPartial Detail\nThe increase in the money supply causes the first upward shift of the AA curve, shown as step 1 in the\ndiagram. Since exchange rates adjust much more rapidly than gross national product (GNP), the economy\nwill quickly adjust to the new A′A′ curve before any change in GNP occurs. That means the first\nadjustment will be from point F to point G directly above. The exchange rate will increase from E1 to E2,\nrepresenting a depreciation of the U.S. dollar.\nThe second effect is caused by changes in investor expectations. Investors generally track important\nchanges in the economy, including money supply changes, because these changes can have important\nimplications for the returns on their investments. Investors who see an increase in money supply in an\neconomy at full employment are likely to expect inflation to occur in the future. When investors expect\nfuture U.S. inflation, and when they consider both domestic and foreign investments, they will respond\ntoday with an increase in their expected future exchange rate (E e). There are two reasons to expect this\n$/£\nimmediate effect:\n1. Investors are very likely to understand the story we are in the process of explaining now. As we will see\nbelow, the long-run effect of a money supply increase for an economy (initially, at full employment) is an\nincrease in the exchange rate (E )—that is, a depreciation of the dollar. If investors believe the exchange\n$/£\nrate will be higher next year due to today’s action by the Fed, then it makes sense for them to raise their\nexpected future exchange rate in anticipation of that effect. Thus the average E e will rise among\n$/£\ninvestors who participate in the foreign exchange (Forex) markets.\n2. Investors may look to the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory for guidance. PPP is generally interpreted\nas a long-run theory of exchange rate trends. If PPP holds in the long run, then E = P /P . In other\n$/£ $ £\n\nwords, the exchange rate will equal the ratio of the two countries’ price levels. If P is expected to rise due\n$\nto inflation, then PPP predicts that the exchange rate (E ) will also rise and the dollar will depreciate.\n$/£\nThe timing of the change in E e will depend on how quickly investors recognize the money supply\n$/£\nchange, compute its likely effect, and incorporate it into their investment plans. Since investors are\ntypically very quick to adapt to market changes, the expectations effect should take place in the short run,\nperhaps long before the inflation ever occurs. In some cases, the expectations change may even occur\nbefore the Fed increases the money supply, if investors anticipate the Fed’s action.\nThe increase in the expected exchange rate (this means a decrease in the expected future dollar value)\ncauses a second upward shift of the AA curve, shown as step 2 in the diagram. Again, rapid exchange rate\nadjustment implies the economy will\nFigure 10.4 Expansionary Monetary Policy in the Long quickly adjust to the new A″A″ curve at\nRun, Continued point H directly above. The exchange rate\nwill now increase from E2 to E3,\nrepresenting a further depreciation of the\nU.S. dollar.\nOnce at point H, aggregate demand, which\nis on the DD curve to the right of H,\nexceeds aggregate supply, which is still\nat YF. Thus GNP will begin to rise to get\nback to G&S market equilibrium on the\nDD curve. However, as GNP rises, the\neconomy moves above the A″A″ curve that\nforces a downward readjustment of the\nexchange rate to get back to asset market\nequilibrium on A″A″. In the end, the\neconomy will adjust in a stepwise fashion\nfrom point H to point I, with each rightward movement in GNP followed by a quick reduction in the\nexchange rate to remain on the A″A″ curve. This process will continue until the economy reaches the\ntemporary superequilibrium at point I.\n\nThe next effect occurs because GNP, now at Y2 at point I, has risen above the full employment level at YF.\nThis causes an increase in U.S. prices, meaning that P (the U.S. price level) begins to rise. The increase in\n$\nU.S. prices has two effects as shown in. An increase in P is both a DD left-shifter and an AA down-shifter.\n$\nIn step 3, we depict a leftward shift of DD to D′D′. DD shifts left because higher U.S. prices will reduce the\nreal exchange rate. This makes U.S. G&S relatively more expensive compared with foreign G&S, thus\nreducing export demand, increasing import demand, and thereby reducing aggregate demand.\nIn step 4, we depict a downward shift of A″A″ to A′″A′″. AA shifts down because a higher U.S. price level\nreduces real money supply. As the real money supply falls, U.S. interest rates rise, leading to an increase\nin the rate of return for U.S. assets as considered by international investors. This in turn raises the\ndemand for U.S. dollars on the Forex, leading to a dollar appreciation. Since this effect occurs for any GNP\nlevel, the entire AA curve shifts downward.\nSteps 3 and 4 will both occur simultaneously, and since both are affected by the increase in the price level,\nit is impossible to know which curve will shift faster or precisely how far each curve will shift. However,\nwe do know two things. First, the AA and DD shifting will continue as long as GNP remains above the full\nemployment level. Once GNP falls to YF, there is no longer upward pressure on the price level and the\nshifting will cease. Second, the final equilibrium exchange rate must lie above the original exchange rate.\nThis occurs because output will revert back to its original level, the price level will be higher, and\naccording to PPP, eventually the exchange rate will have to be higher as well.\nThe final equilibrium will be at a point like J, which lies to the left of I. In this transition, the exchange\nrate will occasionally rise when DD shifts left and will occasionally fall when AA shifts down. Thus the\neconomy will wiggle its way up and down, from point I to J. Once at point J, there is no reason for prices\nto rise further and no reason for a change in investor expectations. The economy will have reached its\nlong-run equilibrium.\nNote that one cannot use the iso-CAB line to assess the long-run effect on the current account balance. In\nthe final adjustment, although the final equilibrium lies above the original iso-CAB line, in the long run\nthe P changes will raise the iso-CAB lines, making it impossible to use these to identify the final effect.\n$\nHowever, in adjusting to the long-run equilibrium, the only two variables affecting the current account\nthat will ultimately change are the exchange rate and the price level. If these two rise proportionally to\n\neach other, as they would if purchasing power parity held, then there will be no long-run effect on the\ncurrent account balance.\nThe final long-run effect of an increase in the U.S. money supply in a floating exchange rate system is a\ndepreciation of the U.S. dollar and no change in real GNP. Along the way, GNP temporarily rises and\nunemployment falls below the natural rate. However, this spurs an increase in the price level, which\nreduces GNP to its full employment level and raises unemployment back to its natural rate. U.S. inflation\noccurs in the transition while the price level is increasing.",
