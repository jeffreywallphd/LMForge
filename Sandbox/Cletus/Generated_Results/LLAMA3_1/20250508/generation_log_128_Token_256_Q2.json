It establishes rules and procedures for resolving disputes and enforcing agreements. Without a legal system, people would be at the mercy of their own personal desires and whims, which could lead to chaos and conflict. A legal system provides a way to resolve disputes and enforce agreements in a fair and impartial manner."

Criminal laws are laws that prohibit certain behaviors and impose penalties for violating them. Civil laws are laws that govern relationships between individuals and businesses. Administrative laws are laws that govern the operation of government agencies and the conduct of government officials."
