This is usually due to inflation. For example, $100 today would be worth $107.64 in 10 years with an inflation rate of 3%.

The WACC is calculated as the weighted average of the costs of each type of capital, where the weights are the proportions of each type of capital in the firm's capital structure. The WACC is used to evaluate the profitability of a project or investment, and it is a key input in the calculation of the net present value (NPV) of a project. The NPV is a measure of the present value of the cash flows associated with a project, and it is used to determine whether a project is worth undertaking."
