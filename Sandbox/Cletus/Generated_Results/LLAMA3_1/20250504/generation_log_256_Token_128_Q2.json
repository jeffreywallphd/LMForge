Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws. Revolutions are \ndifficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an \naspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLaw is the result of political action, and the political landscape is vastly different from nation to nation. \nUnstable or authoritarian governments often fail to serve the principal functions of law. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Consider Burma (named Myanmar by its military rulers). What political rights do you have that the average \nBurmese citizen does not? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n6 \n2.

                    "answer": "A nongovernment organization, or NGO, is an organization that is not a part of the government. It is a group of people who work together to promote a cause or achieve a goal. NGOs can be found all over the world and work on a variety of issues, from human rights to environmental protection. NGOs are often involved in international affairs and can play a role in influencing government policy. They can also provide support and assistance to individuals and communities in need."
