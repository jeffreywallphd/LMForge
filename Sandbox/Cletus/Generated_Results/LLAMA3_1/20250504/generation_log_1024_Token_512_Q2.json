            "chunk": "there are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory. Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts.

            "chunk": "Statutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes, \nzoning laws, and misdemeanors or infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking. Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases. How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why?

The US Constitution is foundational; US statutory \nand common law cannot be inconsistent with its provisions. Congress creates statutory law (with the \nsignature of the president), and courts will interpret constitutional law and statutory law. Where there is \nneither constitutional law nor statutory law, the courts function in the realm of common law. The same is true \nof law within the fifty states, each of which also has a constitution, or foundational law. \nBoth the federal government and the states have created administrative agencies. An agency only has the \npower that the legislature gives it. Within the scope of that power, an agency will often create regulations \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"), which have the same force and effect as statutes. Treaties are never \nnegotiated and concluded by states, as the federal government has exclusive authority over relations with \nother nation-states. A treaty, once ratified by the Senate, has the same force and effect as a statute passed by \nCongress and signed into law by the president. \nConstitutions, statutes, regulations, treaties, and court decisions can provide a legal basis in the positive law. \nYou may believe you have been wronged, but for you to have a right that is enforceable in court, you must \nhave something in the positive law that you can point to that will support a cause of action against your \nchosen defendant. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n29 \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Although there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most nations do not permit \ntheir judiciaries to declare legislative acts unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently), all \nof them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases, and none of them relies on the comprehensive, \nlegislative codes that are prevalent in civil-law systems. \n \nCivil-Law Systems \nThe main alternative to the common-law legal system was developed in Europe and is based in Roman \nand Napoleonic law. A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal rules are in one or more \ncomprehensive legislative enactments. During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws—a code—\nwas developed for all of France. The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French",

The major agency for growth and change, however, is the legislature, not the courts.” \n \nCivil-law systems are used throughout Europe as well as in Central and South America. Some nations in \nAsia and Africa have also adopted codes based on European civil law. Germany, Holland, Spain, France, \nand Portugal all had colonies outside of Europe, and many of these colonies adopted the legal practices \nthat were imposed on them by colonial rule, much like the original thirteen states of the United States, \nwhich adopted English common-law practices. \n \nOne source of possible confusion at this point is that we have already referred to US civil law in contrast to \ncriminal law. But the European civil law covers both civil and criminal law. \nThere are also legal systems that differ significantly from the common-law and civil-law systems. The \ncommunist and socialist legal systems that remain (e.g., in Cuba and North Korea) operate on very \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n31 \ndifferent assumptions than those of either English common law or European civil law. Islamic and other \nreligion-based systems of law bring different values and assumptions to social and commercial relations. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLegal systems vary widely in their aims and in the way they process civil and criminal cases. Common-law \nsystems use juries, have one judge, and adhere to precedent. Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

Define ethics and explain the importance of good ethics for business people and business \norganizations. \n2. Understand the principal philosophies of ethics, including utilitarianism, duty-based ethics, and virtue \nethics. \n3. Distinguish between the ethical merits of various choices by using an ethical decision model. \n4. Explain the difference between shareholder and stakeholder models of ethical corporate governance. \n5. Explain why it is difficult to establish and maintain an ethical corporate culture in a business \norganization. \n \n \nFew subjects are more contentious or important as the role of business in society, particularly, \nwhether corporations have social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing shareholder \nvalue. While the phrase “business ethics” is not oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is \nplenty of evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out primarily for themselves. However, \nbusiness organizations ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers, employees, the \nmedia, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government officials, and socially responsible \ninvestors at their peril. Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term interests of many \ncompanies, who find that sustainable profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as \nwell as profits. \n \nThis chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential businesspeople to the differences \nbetween legal compliance and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical perspectives \nthat apply to business, businesspeople, and the role of business organizations in society. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n43 \n \n \n \n2.1 What Is Ethics? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain how both individuals and institutions can be viewed as ethical or unethical. \n2. Explain how law and ethics are different, and why a good reputation can be more important than legal \ncompliance. \n \n \nMost of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality. \nThe question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in \nany situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act \nis “better” in a moral or ethical sense than some other act?  \nPeople sometimes speak of morality as something personal but view ethics as having wider social \nimplications. Others see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being ethics. Ethics \nwould be morality as applied to any number of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, \nor the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants. We will venture a \ndefinition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms. \nPeople often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of \ncorporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation. For example, if North Korea is characterized by the US \npresident as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in \ncertain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n44 \n \nIn talking about morality, we often use the word good; but that word can be confusing. If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values.

If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions \nwith a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities. But if I said that he was honest, \ncaring, forthright, and diligent, volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church, many \npeople would see Daniel as having certain ethical or moral qualities. If I said that he keeps the \nGolden Rule as well as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical person. But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions \nabout what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. \n2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them. \n3. Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding does not mean the same as saying a \nperson or company is ethical. \n \nHere is a cautionary note: for individuals, it is far from easy to recognize an ethical problem, have a \nclear and usable decision-making process to deal it, and then have the moral courage to do what’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n45 \nright. All of that is even more difficult within a business organization, where corporate employees \nvary in their motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character. There is no universally accepted \nway for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly \ndisagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel \nloyal and accountable to one another. \n \nBefore talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—\n“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society \noperates and is governed. \n \nHow Do Law and Ethics Differ? \nThere is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence. Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law. There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it. Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n46 \nperception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials). \n• \nThe goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price",

                    "answer": "The role of finance in an organization is to provide the resources needed to achieve its goals. This includes providing capital for investment, managing cash flow, and ensuring that the organization has the financial resources to meet its obligations. Finance also plays a key role in managing risk, such as by hedging against potential losses and by ensuring that the organization has the liquidity to meet its obligations. Additionally, finance is responsible for managing the organization's financial reporting, accounting, and auditing activities. Finally, finance is responsible for ensuring that the organization is compliant with all applicable financial regulations and laws."

The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.",

Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.\nShould you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?\nShould you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to\nassess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer\nyou really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\n12\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even\nnationalization of a firm or industry.\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n13\n1.2\nThe Role of Finance in an Organization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the finance function.\n•\nExplain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.\nThe Finance Function\nFinance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job\nresponsibilities.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most\nimportant aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n•\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic\nconditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n•\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are\nimportant aspects of financial planning.

It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should",

By analyzing financial data, businesses can identify trends and patterns that can help them make better decisions. For example, by analyzing financial ratios, businesses can identify areas where they are doing well and areas where they need to improve. Additionally, by analyzing common-size financial statements, businesses can compare their performance to their competitors. Finally, by analyzing trend statements, businesses can identify changes in their financial performance over time. All of this information can help businesses make better decisions and achieve their financial goals."

Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.\nMotivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton\nShould you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a\nnew product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family.

They were selling an experience, not a bicycle. The\nequipment is expensive—a Peloton bike typically costs over $2,000. Peloton equips its studios with state-of-\nthe-art camera and music systems and pays its instructors top dollar. Along the way, the founders made\nseveral critical financial decisions. They kept control of the firm by using private funding at the start.\nHow can we tell if Peloton has managed its resources well? The company started with $400,000 of funding\nto develop a prototype in 2012. By 2018, firm value increased to $4 billion with yet another round of private\ninvestor funding. As of April 2021, Peloton is a publicly traded company with a stock value of $34 billion. The\nexecutives are sacrificing profits in the short term to generate growth and long-term profitability. The firm\nuses its financial statements to identify sources and uses of funds, to test the effectiveness of advertising,\nand to forecast future profitability. Analysts like the firm, the stock price is up, and by many financial\nmeasures, Peloton has been a great success. Time will tell if the decisions made over the last several years\nwill lead to long-term profitability or if the company has overinvested in marketing only to miss current and\nlong-term profits.\n(Sources: Viktor. “The Peloton Business Model—How Does Peloton Work & Make Money?” Productmint.\nUpdated May 9, 2021. https://productmint.com/the-peloton-business-model-how-does-peloton-make-\nmoney/.

Job descriptions vary\nacross firms, industries, and government organizations. However, the role of financial analyst usually includes\nmarket research, financial forecasting, modeling, cost analysis, and comparative valuations. Financial analysts\ngather data and produce financial reports in conjunction with multiple departments within a business or\norganization. They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they\nwork with accountants to create accurate financial reports.\nAs a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma\nfinancial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes.\nFinancial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative\nand qualitative. Figure 1.6 lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis. Some firms\nrequire an MBA or several years of business experience for their financial analysts.\n1.4 • Careers in Finance\n19\nFigure 1.6 Financial Analyst Tasks\nInternal financial analysts are important for a successful firm or organization because their work can lead to\nmore efficient and cost-effective use of financial and nonfinancial resources. Responsibilities include keeping\ncurrent with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and\noutcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports. Various government agencies also use financial analysts to aid in regulatory oversight and\nenforcement.\nA report from a 2019 BLS survey determines that financial analysts earn an average salary of $81,590, and jobs\nare predicted to grow at a faster-than-average rate of 5% through 2029.5\nBusiness (or Management) Analyst Roles\nThe job description for a business analyst looks much like that for a financial analyst.

However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs. Toss in\na pandemic, and a bottleneck or two, and suddenly international macroeconomic factors can affect almost\nevery aspect of commerce and international trade.\n24\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFor example, how far did your new iPhone travel before it got into your hands? Apple is an American\ncompany headquartered in Cupertino, California, and worth over $2 trillion.8 However, your phone may\nhave visited as many as six continents before it reached you.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own\nlimited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize\nonly their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of\nthese factors.\nA common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and\nmicroeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement.
