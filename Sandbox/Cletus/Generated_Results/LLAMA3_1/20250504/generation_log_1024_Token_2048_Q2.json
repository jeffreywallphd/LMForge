With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \ninternational community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet \nUnion, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders. \nWhen Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly \nfor home turf rather than share power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups \nof families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be \nseen. \n \nLaw and Politics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n5 \nIn the United States, legislators, judges, administrative agencies, governors, and presidents make law, \nwith substantial input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle Association. In \nthe fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people. The process of electing \nstate judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign \ncontributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings. \n \nIn the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other \nelected officials (the Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of \nSenate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes. Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws. Revolutions are \ndifficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an \naspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLaw is the result of political action, and the political landscape is vastly different from nation to nation. \nUnstable or authoritarian governments often fail to serve the principal functions of law. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought.

The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence. \nSome Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to \noverturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n11 \nRelated to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought. This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nEach of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource.

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v.

We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar?

(What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.)

(If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations).

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. Lieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of cases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. Governments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, corporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, or U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be sued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the government waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits.

The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress.

The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year.

If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases. How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A holding is the \ncourt’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the \nmeaning of the case as a precedent for future cases. \n \nBeyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to \nunderstand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought) \neach trial or appellate judge believes in.

The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French \ncourts may feel bound to reach the same result in future cases, under the doctrine of jurisprudence \nconstante.

Islamic and other \nreligion-based systems of law bring different values and assumptions to social and commercial relations. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLegal systems vary widely in their aims and in the way they process civil and criminal cases. Common-law \nsystems use juries, have one judge, and adhere to precedent. Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct \nalleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with \ndiscrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group \nworkers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. \n957,32 L. Ed. 2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of \nharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable. \n \nWe therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test.

Define ethics and explain the importance of good ethics for business people and business \norganizations. \n2. Understand the principal philosophies of ethics, including utilitarianism, duty-based ethics, and virtue \nethics. \n3. Distinguish between the ethical merits of various choices by using an ethical decision model. \n4. Explain the difference between shareholder and stakeholder models of ethical corporate governance. \n5. Explain why it is difficult to establish and maintain an ethical corporate culture in a business \norganization. \n \n \nFew subjects are more contentious or important as the role of business in society, particularly, \nwhether corporations have social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing shareholder \nvalue. While the phrase “business ethics” is not oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is \nplenty of evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out primarily for themselves. However, \nbusiness organizations ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers, employees, the \nmedia, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government officials, and socially responsible \ninvestors at their peril. Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term interests of many \ncompanies, who find that sustainable profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as \nwell as profits. \n \nThis chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential businesspeople to the differences \nbetween legal compliance and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical perspectives \nthat apply to business, businesspeople, and the role of business organizations in society. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n43 \n \n \n \n2.1 What Is Ethics? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain how both individuals and institutions can be viewed as ethical or unethical. \n2. Explain how law and ethics are different, and why a good reputation can be more important than legal \ncompliance. \n \n \nMost of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality. \nThe question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in \nany situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act \nis “better” in a moral or ethical sense than some other act?  \nPeople sometimes speak of morality as something personal but view ethics as having wider social \nimplications. Others see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being ethics. Ethics \nwould be morality as applied to any number of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, \nor the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants. We will venture a \ndefinition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms. \nPeople often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of \ncorporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation. For example, if North Korea is characterized by the US \npresident as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in \ncertain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n44 \n \nIn talking about morality, we often use the word good; but that word can be confusing. If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values. If I like Daniel",

If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions \nwith a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities. But if I said that he was honest, \ncaring, forthright, and diligent, volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church, many \npeople would see Daniel as having certain ethical or moral qualities. If I said that he keeps the \nGolden Rule as well as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical person. But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions \nabout what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. \n2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them. \n3. Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding does not mean the same as saying a \nperson or company is ethical. \n \nHere is a cautionary note: for individuals, it is far from easy to recognize an ethical problem, have a \nclear and usable decision-making process to deal it, and then have the moral courage to do what’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n45 \nright. All of that is even more difficult within a business organization, where corporate employees \nvary in their motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character. There is no universally accepted \nway for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly \ndisagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel \nloyal and accountable to one another. \n \nBefore talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—\n“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society \noperates and is governed. \n \nHow Do Law and Ethics Differ? \nThere is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence. Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law. There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it. Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n46 \nperception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials). \n• \nThe goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price",

The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality\ngrew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was\nIntroduction to Finance\n1\n1 • Why It Matters\n7\ndesigned to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.\nBacon Signs’ ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the\nfirm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM.

The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments.

When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged.

The Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most\nimportant aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n•\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic\nconditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n•\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are\nimportant aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,\nhow it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help\nto evaluate a firm.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nElements of a Financial Plan",

Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and strategic planning.\n\nFinancial Planning\n\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit. Financial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions required to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners. These could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store, partners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning helps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans typically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\n\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements are created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income statements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the timing and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most important aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are important aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been, how it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\n\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help to evaluate a firm.\n\nLINK TO LEARNING Elements of a Financial Plan\n\nResponse Format:\n\n[{\n    \"question\": \"generated question\", \n    \"answer\": \"generated Answer\"\n}]\n\nQuestion answers should be at least 250 words long.\n\nDo NOT include any explanation or preamble before or after the JSON output.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON output.\n\nAnswer: \n\n                 [\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What Is Finance?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Finance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job responsibilities. The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a knowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting activities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts receivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and liability tracking and monitoring activities.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should",

Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.\nMotivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton\nShould you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a\nnew product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular",

Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports.

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell.

This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6\nMicroeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n•\nDiscuss the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n•\nExplain the importance of macroeconomic variables in finance markets.\nMicroeconomics\nIn the business setting, finance is the intersection of economics and accounting. Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\n7\nUnited States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\n23\nHowever, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual\nfirm and industry forecasts. Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations.

What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?\nJust to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, Donald Trump or\nBarack Obama?\nEach of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock\nmarket, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs. Toss in\na pandemic, and a bottleneck or two, and suddenly international macroeconomic factors can affect almost\nevery aspect of commerce and international trade.\n24\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFor example, how far did your new iPhone travel before it got into your hands?

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own\nlimited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize\nonly their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of\nthese factors.\nA common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and\nmicroeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement. For example, the national\nrate of unemployment may not have been much help when Bacon Signs was searching for skilled laborers\nwho could form neon signs.
