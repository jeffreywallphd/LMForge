The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource. Which school of legal thought does \nher criticism reflect? \n2. Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” \nWhich school of legal thought is represented by this quote? \n3. Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard \nunder Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual \nextermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald. After an Israeli “extraction team” took him \nfrom Argentina to Israel, he was put on trial for “crimes against humanity.” His defense was that he was \n“just following orders.” Explain why Eichmann was not an adherent of the natural-law school of legal \nthought.",

                    "question": "What is the difference between natural law and positive law?",
                    "answer": "Natural law is the idea that there are inherent moral laws that are part of the nature of things. Positive law is the idea that laws are created by human beings, and they can be changed or abolished."

Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A holding is the \ncourt’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the \nmeaning of the case as a precedent for future cases. \n \nBeyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to \nunderstand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought)",

            "chunk": "compliance. \n \n \nMost of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality. \nThe question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in \nany situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act \nis “better” in a moral or ethical sense than some other act?  \nPeople sometimes speak of morality as something personal but view ethics as having wider social \nimplications. Others see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being ethics. Ethics \nwould be morality as applied to any number of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, \nor the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants. We will venture a \ndefinition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms. \nPeople often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of \ncorporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation. For example, if North Korea is characterized by the US \npresident as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in \ncertain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n44 \n \nIn talking about morality, we often use the word good; but that word can be confusing. If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense.",

The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.\nShould you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?\nShould you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to\nassess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer\nyou really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\n12\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or",

The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones.

Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions.

For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker.
