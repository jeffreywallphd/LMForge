            "chunk": "there are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory. Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence.",

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts.

When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power.

Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective. That is, the United States may “unbind” itself \nwhenever it chooses. But for practical purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the \nnation. The argument goes something like this: if free trade in general helps the United States, then it \nmakes some sense to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite some temporary setbacks, \nthe WTO decision process will (it is hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run. This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process. Had Ross Perot \nbeen elected in 1992, for example, NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during his term \nof office. \n \nCauses of Action, Precedent, and Stare Decisis \nNo matter how wrong someone’s actions may seem to you, the only wrongs you can right in a court are \nthose that can be tied to one or more causes of action. Positive law is full of cases, treaties, statutes, \nregulations, and constitutional provisions that can be made into a cause of action. If you have an \nagreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-six trombones from you and he fails to pay for \nthem after you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will only act favorably on your \ncomplaint if you can show that his behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your state’s \ncontract law. This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n26 \nthat the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use \nto him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him. \n \nAn old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis \nnon curat lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action. If you are \nstood up for a Saturday night date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover anything in a \ncourt of law in the United States, as there is no cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can \nuse in your complaint. If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases.

Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 877–\n878 (CA9 1991) (rejecting such a requirement). \n \nII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n35 \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it “an unlawful employment practice for an \nemployer…to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct \nalleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with \ndiscrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group \nworkers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. \n957,32 L. Ed. 2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of \nharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable. \n \nWe therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity",

(This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who",

The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5.

In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct \nthan achieving the right results. A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary.

In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good. Your college or \nschool is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks \nbehind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, \nthe sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, \nor standards that people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free \n(though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country. \n \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules \nof smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or \nCalifornia) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be seen as a \nfundamental social contract. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n55 \nIt is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as \nthe US Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and \norganic changes. Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain \nfundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not. People can give up \nfreedom-oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches \nand seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example, many citizens in \nRussia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and \npredictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom. \n \nThus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the \nsociety. This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni.

It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope. \n \nThe relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: \n \n1. If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy. [2] \n \nAs to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove \nhelpful. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n58 \nMichael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core values has been \nidentified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate \ndecisions. \n \nTo simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States. \nWhen you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, \npower, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality. They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But",

For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation.

Insofar as his actions…reduce returns to stockholders, he is spending their \nmoney. Insofar as his actions raise the price to customers, he is spending the customers’ money. \nInsofar as his actions lower the wages of some employees, he is spending their money. \n \nThis process raises political questions on two levels: principle and consequences. On the level of \npolitical principle, the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of tax proceeds are governmental \nfunctions. We have established elaborate constitutional, parliamentary, and judicial provisions to \ncontrol these functions, to assure that taxes are imposed so far as possible in accordance with the \npreferences and desires of the public.… \n \n \nOthers have challenged the notion that corporate managers have no real duties except toward the owners \n(shareholders). By changing two letters in shareholder, stakeholder theorists widened the range of people \nand institutions that a corporation should pay moral consideration to. Thus they contend that a \ncorporation, through its management, has a set of responsibilities toward nonshareholder interests. \n \nStakeholder Theory \nStakeholders of a corporation include its employees, suppliers, customers, and the community. \nStakeholder is a deliberate play on the word shareholder, to emphasize that corporations have obligations \nthat extend beyond the bottom-line aim of maximizing profits. A stakeholder is anyone who most would \nagree is significantly affected (positively or negatively) by the decision of another moral agent. \n \nThere is one vital fact about corporations: the corporation is a creation of the law. Without law (and \ngovernment), corporations would not have existence. The key concept for corporations is the legal fact of \nlimited liability. The benefit of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant that larger pools of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n69 \ncapital could be aggregated for larger enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments should \nthe venture fail in any way, and there would be no personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal \nassets other than the value of the corporate stock. Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be",

As Table 2.1 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n70 \n\"The Stakes of Various Stakeholders\" indicates, stakeholders have very different kinds of interests \n(“stakes”) in the actions of a corporation. \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.1 The Stakes of Various Stakeholders \nOwnership \nThe value of the organization has a direct impact on the wealth of these \nstakeholders. \nManagers \nDirectors who \nown stock \nShareholders \nEconomic \nDependence \nStakeholders can be economically dependent without having ownership. \nEach of these stakeholders relies on the corporation in some way for \nfinancial well-being. \nSalaried \nmanagers \nCreditors \nSuppliers \nEmployees \nLocal \ncommunities \nSocial Interests \nThese stakeholders are not directly linked to the organization but have \nan interest in making sure the organization acts in a socially responsible \nmanner. \nCommunities \nGovernment \nMedia \n \nCorporate Culture and Codes of Ethics \nA corporation is a “person” capable of suing, being sued, and having rights and duties in our legal system. \n(It is a legal or juridical person, not a natural person, according to our Supreme Court.) Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and",

A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states). Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85 \nOne familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases \ninvolving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for \nconsiderably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000). The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget.

However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial",

Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing\nregulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

Government and\nwork-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must\ntake greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let’s take a closer\nlook at some of the reasons why we study finance.\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may\npique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify\nyou for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in\nCareers in Finance.\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\nanalytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live. Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\nRisk and Return in Finance\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.",

Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,\nhow it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help\nto evaluate a firm.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nElements of a Financial Plan\nYou can view key elements in a financial plan (https://openstax.org/r/write-your-business-plan) at the US\nSmall Business Administration’s website.\nForecasting and Budgeting\nForecasting and budgeting are common practices for businesses, governmental agencies, not-for-profit firms,\nand individual households. As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should",

Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports.

They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6\nMicroeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n•\nDiscuss the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n•\nExplain the importance of macroeconomic variables in finance markets.\nMicroeconomics\nIn the business setting, finance is the intersection of economics and accounting. Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\n7\nUnited States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\n23\nHowever, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual\nfirm and industry forecasts. Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations.

Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement.

            "chunk": "knowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\nfavorable growth opportunities.\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a\ncorporation and is another factor that enhances its value.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAmazon\nMost people are surprised to learn than Amazon, the largest online retailer, is set up as an LLC.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n43\nAmazon.com Services LLC is set up as a subsidiary of the larger Amazon.com Inc. Take a look at the Amazon\nLLC company profile provided by Dun & Bradstreet (https://openstax.org/r/company-profiles-amazon).\nWhy do you think such a large corporation is set up as an LLC?\nIncorporating a Business\nMany business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\narticles of incorporation include the following:\n•\nDomestic corporation (in state)\n•\nForeign corporation (out of state or out of country)\n•\nClose (closely held) corporation\n•\nProfessional corporation\n•\nNonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\n•\nStock corporation\n•\nNon-stock corporation\n•\nPublic benefit corporation\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\n2.2\nRelationship between Shareholders and Company Management\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between principals and agents.\n•\nList and discuss various stakeholders associated with a company and its operations.\n•\nExplain how management impacts the operations and future of a company.\nStakeholders\nA stakeholder is any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.\nStakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.",

Every public company is legally required to install a\nboard of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\nprofits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.",

Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.\nOften, Congress enacts laws and regulations in response to major economic or other highly visible events.\nFollowing the great market crash of 1929, the US government created a new set of rules and regulations\ngoverning the issuing and trading of securities, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934. The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\nand regulations.\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors. It also set a requirement that the SEC issue new rulings that establish compliance with the act.\nBoard of Directors Oversight and Corporate Governance\nBecause of the widely publicized control breakdowns at Wells Fargo Bank and recent regulatory actions,\nboards of directors of public companies and financial institutions have been directed to improve oversight and\n2\nScott Vogel. “You Paid for It: AIG’s Retreat Destination, Up Close.” Washington Post.

Boards are evolving from focusing primarily on the needs of top key individuals to\nconsidering broader aspects of ethics, values, and corporate culture. Boards now oversee the monitoring\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\n•\nconfirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\n•\nverifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\n•\nensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\nverifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\n•\ncoordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees.

Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long\nway to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most\nbusinesses and organizations around the world.\nBoard members face many challenges in making decisions effectively and efficiently as possible. Because of\nsuch challenges, the potential objective of diversifying the boardroom competes with other worthy topics and\nobjectives such as improving cybersecurity, advancing customer service, identifying and reducing risk,\nimproving community relations, and positioning strategically within an industry. This has left corporate\ngovernance experts and researchers in a situation where they find themselves “playing catch-up” to\nadequately diversify.\n2.3 • Role of the Board of Directors\n49\n2.4\nAgency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine the concept of agency costs.\n•\nDiscuss conflicts of interest between board members, company management, and employees.\n•\nDefine each component of ESG.\n•\nDiscuss the findings indicating how ESG policies impact stock returns.\nAgency Problems and Issues\nAgency problems refers to conflicts that occur when an agent (manager) who is entrusted with following the\ninterests of the principal (shareholder or owner) of an organization abuses their position to further their own\npersonal goals. In the field of corporate finance, agency problems are often related to a conflict of interest\nbetween the management of a company and its shareholders.\nFor many years, this has been a very common problem that has been seen in nearly every kind of organization,\nirrespective of it being a church, a club, a not-for-profit organization, a multinational corporation, or any other\ngovernment agency or institution. As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be\nresolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.\nEvery company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and\npersonal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders\n(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own\nwealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the\ngoodwill of the shareholder base.\nThere are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nExample of an Agency Problem\nABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the\nselling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own\npersonal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price\nof the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.\nAdditionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall\nquality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced\nbetween stockholders and loyal customers of the company.\nStockholders versus Management\nLarge corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential\nfor an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type\nof agency problem.\nSegregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not\nhave any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts\nand professionals to manage key operations of the business.\nHowever, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.\nExternal managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even\n50\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmisusing company funds. This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate",

This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate\nactions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,\nand ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\nInvestors versus Creditors\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\npossible default.\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\nstakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.\nIf such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the\norganization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the\ncompany as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus\nother stakeholders.\nA more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift\nbasket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.4 This was a direct result of the company\nbeing purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of\ndebt. However, the most important factor leading to the company’s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer,\nwho was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant\nexecutive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry & David has since emerged\nfrom bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen\nwhen stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate\nenvironment.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nInfamous Agency Problems\nEnron\nEnron is one particularly infamous example of an agency problem. Enron’s directors were responsible for\nprotecting and promoting investor interests, but they failed to carry out their regulatory and oversight\nresponsibilities, enabling the company to venture into illegal activity. The company’s resulting accounting\nscandal resulted in billions of dollars in losses to its investors.\nAt one time, Enron had been one of the largest companies in the United States. Despite being a multibillion-\n3\nAnshita Kohli. “Worldcom Scam: The Fall of the Biggest US Telecommunication Company.” The Company Ninja.

It had also started incurring a tremendous amount of\ndebt. Fearing a drop in stock prices, Enron’s management team tried to disguise the problems by\nmisrepresenting them through inappropriate accounting methods, which resulted in confusing and\nmisleading financial statements.\nDisaster started to unfold in 2001, when common stock prices fell from $90 to under $1 per share. The\ncompany filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, and criminal charges were brought against several key\nEnron employees, including former CEO Kenneth Lay and former CFO Andrew Fastow. Jeffrey Skilling was\nsubsequently named CEO in February 2001, but he ended up resigning six months later.\nBernard L.
