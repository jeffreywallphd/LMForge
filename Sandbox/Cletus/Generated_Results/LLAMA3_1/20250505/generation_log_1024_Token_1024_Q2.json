Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence. \nSome Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free.

This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nEach of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource.

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts.

As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress.

The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year.

Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances.

Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute.

Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwould override previous federal or state statutes. \n \nOne example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-\ndolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico. The Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments \nin 1988 spelled out certain protections for dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n25 \nbegan refusing to allow the importation of tuna that were caught using “dolphin-unfriendly” methods \n(such as purse seining). This was challenged at a GATT dispute panel in Switzerland, and the United \nStates lost. The discussion continued at the WTO under its dispute resolution process. In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective. That is, the United States may “unbind” itself \nwhenever it chooses. But for practical purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the \nnation. The argument goes something like this: if free trade in general helps the United States, then it \nmakes some sense to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite some temporary setbacks, \nthe WTO decision process will (it is hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run. This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process. Had Ross Perot \nbeen elected in 1992, for example, NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during his term \nof office. \n \nCauses of Action, Precedent, and Stare Decisis \nNo matter how wrong someone’s actions may seem to you, the only wrongs you can right in a court are \nthose that can be tied to one or more causes of action. Positive law is full of cases, treaties, statutes, \nregulations, and constitutional provisions that can be made into a cause of action. If you have an \nagreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-six trombones from you and he fails to pay for \nthem after you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will only act favorably on your \ncomplaint if you can show that his behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your state’s \ncontract law. This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n26 \nthat the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use \nto him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him. \n \nAn old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis \nnon curat lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action. If you are \nstood up for a Saturday night date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover anything in a \ncourt of law in the United States, as there is no cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can \nuse in your complaint. If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases.

Although there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most nations do not permit \ntheir judiciaries to declare legislative acts unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently), all \nof them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases, and none of them relies on the comprehensive, \nlegislative codes that are prevalent in civil-law systems. \n \nCivil-Law Systems \nThe main alternative to the common-law legal system was developed in Europe and is based in Roman \nand Napoleonic law. A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal rules are in one or more \ncomprehensive legislative enactments. During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws—a code—\nwas developed for all of France. The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases.

Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct \nalleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with \ndiscrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group \nworkers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. \n957,32 L. Ed. 2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of \nharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable. \n \nWe therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test.

There is no universally accepted \nway for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly \ndisagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel \nloyal and accountable to one another. \n \nBefore talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—\n“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society \noperates and is governed. \n \nHow Do Law and Ethics Differ? \nThere is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence. Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law. There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it. Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n46 \nperception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials). \n• \nThe goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price",

An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each. The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money.

In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct \nthan achieving the right results. A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society,",

Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n54 \noften admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, \nassistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, \neducation, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security). \n \nPeople who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government \ngoods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all. One response \nmight be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in \na “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government. He called this \nthe social contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and \ncommon benefits. In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good. Your college or \nschool is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks \nbehind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, \nthe sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, \nor standards that people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free \n(though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country. \n \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules \nof smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or \nCalifornia) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be seen as a \nfundamental social contract. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n55 \nIt is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as \nthe US Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and \norganic changes. Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain \nfundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not. People can give up \nfreedom-oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches \nand seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example, many citizens in \nRussia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and \npredictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom. \n \nThus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the \nsociety. This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook.

It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope. \n \nThe relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: \n \n1. If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

The benefit of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant that larger pools of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n69 \ncapital could be aggregated for larger enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments should \nthe venture fail in any way, and there would be no personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal \nassets other than the value of the corporate stock. Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be",

A socially responsible corporation is likely to \nconsider the impact of its decisions on a wide range of stakeholders, not just shareholders. As Table 2.1 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n70 \n\"The Stakes of Various Stakeholders\" indicates, stakeholders have very different kinds of interests \n(“stakes”) in the actions of a corporation. \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.1 The Stakes of Various Stakeholders \nOwnership \nThe value of the organization has a direct impact on the wealth of these \nstakeholders. \nManagers \nDirectors who \nown stock \nShareholders \nEconomic \nDependence \nStakeholders can be economically dependent without having ownership. \nEach of these stakeholders relies on the corporation in some way for \nfinancial well-being. \nSalaried \nmanagers \nCreditors \nSuppliers \nEmployees \nLocal \ncommunities \nSocial Interests \nThese stakeholders are not directly linked to the organization but have \nan interest in making sure the organization acts in a socially responsible \nmanner. \nCommunities \nGovernment \nMedia \n \nCorporate Culture and Codes of Ethics \nA corporation is a “person” capable of suing, being sued, and having rights and duties in our legal system. \n(It is a legal or juridical person, not a natural person, according to our Supreme Court.) Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and",

The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and \nmodeled by the top of the organization. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n72 \n \nIt’s often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as top management is willing to make it. If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n73 \nIf you manage by the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers, based on the need to get \nstock price ever higher. At Enron, “15 percent a year or better earnings growth” was the mantra. Jeffrey \nPfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, observes how the belief that “stock \nprice is all that matters” has been hardwired into the corporate psyche. It dictates not only how people \njudge the worth of their company but also how they feel about themselves and the work that they are \ndoing. And, over time, it has clouded judgments about what is acceptable corporate behavior. [6] \n \nManaging by Numbers: The Sears Auto Center Story \nIf winning is the most important thing in your life, then you must be prepared to do anything to \nwin. \n—Michael Josephson \n \nMost people want to be winners or associate with winners. As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers. But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs. The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year",

New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n• \nThe long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to \nmeasure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially. \n• \nSears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant \ninformation about the service being offered. This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier. Sears, like other \nsellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would \nnot permit such information distortions. \n• \nPeople in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary. \n \nNoting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had \nlost sight of other goals for the organization. \n \nThe emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical. The \ntemptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write \nthe history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done. In a way, this \nfits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. \n \nConscious Capitalism \nOne effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious \ncapitalism movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7]",

[7] \n \nThe “conscious business” has a purpose that goes beyond maximizing profits. It is designed to maximize \nprofits but is focused more on its higher purpose and does not fixate solely on the bottom line. To do so, it \nfocuses on delivering value to all its stakeholders, harmonizing as best it can the interests of consumers, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n76 \npartners, investors, the community, and the environment. This requires that company managers take a \n“servant leadership” role, serving as stewards to the company’s deeper purpose and to the company’s \nstakeholders. \n \nConscious business leaders serve as such stewards, focusing on fulfilling the company’s purpose, \ndelivering value to its stakeholders, and facilitating a harmony of interests, rather than on personal gain \nand self-aggrandizement. Why is this refocusing needed? Within the standard profit-maximizing model, \ncorporations have long had to deal with the “agency problem.” Actions by top-level managers—acting on \nbehalf of the company—should align with the shareholders, but in a culture all about winning and money, \nmanagers sometimes act in ways that are self-aggrandizing and that do not serve the interests of \nshareholders. Laws exist to limit such self-aggrandizing, but the remedies are often too little and too late \nand often catch only the most egregious overreaching. Having a culture of servant leadership is a much \nbetter way to see that a company’s top management works to ensure a harmony of interests. \n \n  \n \n[1] See Robert Jackall, Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988). \n[2] John Schwartz, “An Enron Unit Chief Warned, and Was Rebuffed,” New York Times, February 20, 2002. \n[3] Warren Bennis, “A Corporate Fear of Too Much Truth,” New York Times, February 17, 2002. \n[4] University of Oklahoma Department of Defense Joint Course in Communication, Case Study: The Johnson & \nJohnson Tylenol Crisis, accessed April 5, 2011. \n[5] FindLaw, Report of Investigation by the Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron Corp., \nFebruary 1, 2002, accessed April 5, 2011,http://news.findlaw.com/wsj/docs/enron/sicreport. \n[6] Steven Pearlstein, “Debating the Enron Effect,” Washington Post, February 17, 2002. \n[7] Milton Friedman, John Mackey, and T.

The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality\ngrew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was\nIntroduction to Finance\n1\n1 • Why It Matters\n7\ndesigned to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.\nBacon Signs’ ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the\nfirm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM.

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.",

Issuing a mortgage can be profitable for a\nbank, but it also allows people to live in their own homes and to pay for them over time. Do MasterCard,\nVenmo, and PayPal make money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and\nsafer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track\nwhere and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to\ncapital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly\nbartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.\nThere are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance.

Let’s take a closer\nlook at some of the reasons why we study finance.\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance.

Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\nanalytical thinking.

                    "question": "Why We Study Finance",
                    "answer": "Finance is the lubricant that keeps our economy running smoothly. Issuing a mortgage can be profitable for a bank, but it also allows people to live in their own homes and to pay for them over time. Do MasterCard, Venmo, and PayPal make money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and safer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track where and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to capital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly bartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.\n\nThere are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides a long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of financial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among the most important tools for advancement toward greater responsibility and remuneration. Government and work-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must take greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let’s take a closer look at some of the reasons why we study finance.\n\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may pique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify you for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in Careers in Finance.\n\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires analytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing, magnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as well, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or paychecks.\n\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment opportunities.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most\nimportant aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n•\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic\nconditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n•\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are\nimportant aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,\nhow it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help\nto evaluate a firm.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nElements of a Financial Plan",

Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.\nMotivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton\nShould you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time?

They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they\nwork with accountants to create accurate financial reports.\nAs a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma\nfinancial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes.\nFinancial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative\nand qualitative. Figure 1.6 lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis. Some firms\nrequire an MBA or several years of business experience for their financial analysts.\n1.4 • Careers in Finance\n19\nFigure 1.6 Financial Analyst Tasks\nInternal financial analysts are important for a successful firm or organization because their work can lead to\nmore efficient and cost-effective use of financial and nonfinancial resources. Responsibilities include keeping\ncurrent with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and\noutcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports. Various government agencies also use financial analysts to aid in regulatory oversight and\nenforcement.\nA report from a 2019 BLS survey determines that financial analysts earn an average salary of $81,590, and jobs\nare predicted to grow at a faster-than-average rate of 5% through 2029.5\nBusiness (or Management) Analyst Roles\nThe job description for a business analyst looks much like that for a financial analyst.

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell.

The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations. Who can run the country’s economic\nsystem better, Republicans or Democrats? Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic\nperformance even though their actual influence is less than you might think.

They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs. Toss in\na pandemic, and a bottleneck or two, and suddenly international macroeconomic factors can affect almost\nevery aspect of commerce and international trade.\n24\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFor example, how far did your new iPhone travel before it got into your hands?

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own\nlimited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize\nonly their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of\nthese factors.\nA common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and\nmicroeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement. For example, the national\nrate of unemployment may not have been much help when Bacon Signs was searching for skilled laborers\nwho could form neon signs.

There are three broad areas of finance:\nbusiness finance, investments, and financial markets and institutions.\n1.2 The Role of Finance in an Organization\nThe accounting department creates financial statements, and the finance department implements the firm’s\npolicy objectives, monitors results, and responds to necessary strategic and tactical changes. Finance is\nresponsible for budgeting and forecasting. Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for\nmeeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or\nhave a claim against firm assets.\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\nMuch of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\nfor their stakeholders.\n1.4 Careers in Finance\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\nto manufacturing, to education.\n1.5 Markets and Participants\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an\nindividual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.\nEconomics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial\nforecasting.\n1.7 Financial Instruments\nMaturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments.

One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\n2.1\nBusiness Structures\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the business form created by most organizations.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\n•\nList and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized. However, the legal\nstructure of any company will have a substantial impact on its operations, and it therefore deserves a\nsignificant amount of analysis and discussion. The four most common forms of business organizations are the\nfollowing:\n1.\nSole proprietorships\n2.\nPartnerships\n3.\nCorporations\n4.\nHybrids, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)\nThe vast majority of businesses take the form of a proprietorship. However, based on the total dollar value of\ncombined sales, more than 80 percent of all business in the United States is conducted by a corporation.1\nBecause corporations engage in the most business, and because most successful businesses eventually\nconvert into corporations, we will focus on corporations in this chapter. However, it is still important to\nunderstand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.\nSole Proprietorships\nA proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of\nforming a business as a sole proprietor is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin\nconducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of\nbusiness organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:\n1.\nThey have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.\n1\nAaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings.

There are no separate\ntaxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report\nall their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.\n4.\nControlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated\nmanagerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.\nHowever, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable\nshortcomings:\n1.\nA sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the\nend, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in\nthe company’s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it.

As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S",

The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\nfavorable growth opportunities.\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a\ncorporation and is another factor that enhances its value.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAmazon\nMost people are surprised to learn than Amazon, the largest online retailer, is set up as an LLC.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n43\nAmazon.com Services LLC is set up as a subsidiary of the larger Amazon.com Inc. Take a look at the Amazon\nLLC company profile provided by Dun & Bradstreet (https://openstax.org/r/company-profiles-amazon).\nWhy do you think such a large corporation is set up as an LLC?\nIncorporating a Business\nMany business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\narticles of incorporation include the following:\n•\nDomestic corporation (in state)\n•\nForeign corporation (out of state or out of country)\n•\nClose (closely held) corporation\n•\nProfessional corporation\n•\nNonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\n•\nStock corporation\n•\nNon-stock corporation\n•\nPublic benefit corporation\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\n2.2\nRelationship between Shareholders and Company Management\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between principals and agents.\n•\nList and discuss various stakeholders associated with a company and its operations.\n•\nExplain how management impacts the operations and future of a company.\nStakeholders\nA stakeholder is any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.\nStakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.",

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\nRole of Management\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have\ndifferent functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits.

Every public company is legally required to install a\nboard of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\nprofits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.",

More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors. It also set a requirement that the SEC issue new rulings that establish compliance with the act.\nBoard of Directors Oversight and Corporate Governance\nBecause of the widely publicized control breakdowns at Wells Fargo Bank and recent regulatory actions,\nboards of directors of public companies and financial institutions have been directed to improve oversight and\n2\nScott Vogel. “You Paid for It: AIG’s Retreat Destination, Up Close.” Washington Post.

Boards are evolving from focusing primarily on the needs of top key individuals to\nconsidering broader aspects of ethics, values, and corporate culture. Boards now oversee the monitoring\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\n•\nconfirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\n•\nverifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\n•\nensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\nverifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\n•\ncoordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees.

It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\n48\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPepsiCo\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry. It has also been noted for its excellence in\ncorporate governance. Take a look at the PepsiCo website (https://openstax.org/r/pepsico). Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States.

In the field of corporate finance, agency problems are often related to a conflict of interest\nbetween the management of a company and its shareholders.\nFor many years, this has been a very common problem that has been seen in nearly every kind of organization,\nirrespective of it being a church, a club, a not-for-profit organization, a multinational corporation, or any other\ngovernment agency or institution. As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be\nresolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.\nEvery company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and\npersonal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders\n(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own\nwealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the\ngoodwill of the shareholder base.\nThere are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nExample of an Agency Problem\nABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the\nselling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own\npersonal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price\nof the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.\nAdditionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall\nquality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced\nbetween stockholders and loyal customers of the company.\nStockholders versus Management\nLarge corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential\nfor an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type\nof agency problem.\nSegregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not\nhave any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts\nand professionals to manage key operations of the business.\nHowever, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.\nExternal managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even\n50\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmisusing company funds. This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate",

Madoff Investment Securities LLC\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\nsaves money.\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\nacting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent\noversight.\nBernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\nhad been newly invested.\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\n(Sources: Diana B.

When perpetuated, these differences may\neventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative\nthat they address the underlying problems of these differences. This will help ensure that normal business\noperations are not being adversely impacted by the agency problem.\nWhile there is no surefire way to resolve all conflicts of interest and agency problems, some measures that can\n52\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nhelp mitigate such issues include the following:\n•\nOffering incentives to management for strong performance and ethical behavior\n•\nAwarding decision makers with stock packages, commissions, and other long-term compensation\npackages to encourage long-term thinking and matching of company objectives with shareholders’\npriorities\n•\nPenalizing poor performance, shortsightedness, and unethical behavior\nThe prevailing belief in agency theory is that when a business creates organizational incentives that encourage\nhard work on projects that will benefit the company in both the short and long term, more employees will be\nencouraged to act in the business’s best interest.\nAnother means of resolving agency problems is through a hostile takeover of the organization. Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any",
