Third, women are not allowed to travel outside of their homes without a male companion, which makes it difficult for them to get to work.

Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions).

Treaties are never \nnegotiated and concluded by states, as the federal government has exclusive authority over relations with \nother nation-states. A treaty, once ratified by the Senate, has the same force and effect as a statute passed by \nCongress and signed into law by the president. \nConstitutions, statutes, regulations, treaties, and court decisions can provide a legal basis in the positive law. \nYou may believe you have been wronged, but for you to have a right that is enforceable in court, you must \nhave something in the positive law that you can point to that will support a cause of action against your \nchosen defendant. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n29 \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Define ethics and explain the importance of good ethics for business people and business \norganizations. \n2. Understand the principal philosophies of ethics, including utilitarianism, duty-based ethics, and virtue \nethics. \n3. Distinguish between the ethical merits of various choices by using an ethical decision model. \n4. Explain the difference between shareholder and stakeholder models of ethical corporate governance. \n5. Explain why it is difficult to establish and maintain an ethical corporate culture in a business \norganization. \n \n \nFew subjects are more contentious or important as the role of business in society, particularly, \nwhether corporations have social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing shareholder \nvalue. While the phrase “business ethics” is not oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is \nplenty of evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out primarily for themselves. However, \nbusiness organizations ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers, employees, the \nmedia, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government officials, and socially responsible \ninvestors at their peril. Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term interests of many \ncompanies, who find that sustainable profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as \nwell as profits. \n \nThis chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential businesspeople to the differences \nbetween legal compliance and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical perspectives \nthat apply to business, businesspeople, and the role of business organizations in society. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n43 \n \n \n \n2.1 What Is Ethics? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain how both individuals and institutions can be viewed as ethical or unethical. \n2. Explain how law and ethics are different, and why a good reputation can be more important than legal \ncompliance. \n \n \nMost of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality. \nThe question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in \nany situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act",

The book is\ndesigned for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as\nsecond-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences\nand course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the\nintroduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and\nPreface\n1\neconomics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial\ntheory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more\nrigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical\ncalculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.\nPedagogical Foundation\nPrinciples of Finance emphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business\nfunctions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates\na unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This\nmultifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.\nTheoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are\nintroduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.\nIn order to create meaning for all students, Principles of Finance exposes them to a range of companies,\nindustries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,\nand American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that\nmay be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,\nsmall business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews\ninclude diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.\nProblems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and\ncontexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice.

The\ndownloadable files for the chapters covering financial forecasting and trade credit (18 and 19) allow students\nto see how changing assumptions and variables impact financial decision-making.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

Short-term financing is used to cover day-to-day expenses and working capital needs, while long-term financing is used for larger projects and investments. Finance can also help an organization manage its cash flow and ensure that it has enough money to pay its bills and meet its obligations. Additionally, finance can help an organization make sound investment decisions and manage its risk."

The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment.

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students.

This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets.

Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective.

When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders.

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups.

Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services.

Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic\nperformance even though their actual influence is less than you might think.

They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs.
