            "chunk": "there are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory. Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought.

The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence. \nSome Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to \noverturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n11 \nRelated to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought. This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nEach of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource. Which school of legal thought does \nher criticism reflect? \n2. Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” \nWhich school of legal thought is represented by this quote? \n3. Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard \nunder Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual \nextermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald. After an Israeli “extraction team” took him \nfrom Argentina to Israel, he was put on trial for “crimes against humanity.” His defense was that he was \n“just following orders.” Explain why Eichmann was not an adherent of the natural-law school of legal \nthought. \n \n  \n \n[1] Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, s.v. “natural law.” \n[2] Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” \n \n \n \n1.3 Basic Concepts and Categories of US Positive Law \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts. In the United States, both the states and the federal government have roles to play, and",

As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code.

The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances.

States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes, \nzoning laws, and misdemeanors or infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking. Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French \ncourts may feel bound to reach the same result in future cases, under the doctrine of jurisprudence \nconstante.

The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 877–\n878 (CA9 1991) (rejecting such a requirement). \n \nII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n35 \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it “an unlawful employment practice for an \nemployer…to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct \nalleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with \ndiscrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group \nworkers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. \n957,32 L. Ed. 2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of \nharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable. \n \nWe therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity",

Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values. If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions \nwith a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities.

An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each. The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct",

Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society, \nbelieving that the government should play that role. Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n54 \noften admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, \nassistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, \neducation, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security). \n \nPeople who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government \ngoods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all. One response \nmight be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in \na “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government. He called this \nthe social contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and \ncommon benefits. In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good. Your college or \nschool is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks \nbehind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, \nthe sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, \nor standards that people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free \n(though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country. \n \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules \nof smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or \nCalifornia) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be seen as a \nfundamental social contract. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n55 \nIt is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as \nthe US Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and \norganic changes. Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain \nfundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not. People can give up \nfreedom-oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches \nand seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example, many citizens in \nRussia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and \npredictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom. \n \nThus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the \nsociety. This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni.

If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy. [2] \n \nAs to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove \nhelpful. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n58 \nMichael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core values has been \nidentified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate \ndecisions. \n \nTo simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States. \nWhen you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, \npower, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality. They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But",

For example, Eliot \nSpitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good \nthey accomplished as public servants.

In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and \ncompliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal proceedings against companies but also \nbecause major companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered retroactively but must be \npursued proactively. For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue \nbecomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the same lesson. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThroughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers \nhave come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social \ncontract theory; and virtue ethics. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nXYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles. Customers \nhave had near-death experiences from sudden acceleration; they would be driving along a highway at normal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n60 \nspeed when suddenly the car would begin to accelerate, and efforts to stop the acceleration by braking fail to \nwork. Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to \ndo so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration. \nInternal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are \nnot being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal. In fact, there appears to be a \npossible flaw in both models, perhaps in a semiconductor chip, that makes sudden acceleration happen. \nInterference by floor mats and poorly designed gas pedals do not seem to be the problem. \nIt is voluntary to report these incidents to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), \nbut the company decides that it will wait awhile and see if there are more complaints. Recalling the two \nmodels so that local dealers and their mechanics could examine them is also an option, but it would be \nextremely costly. Company executives are aware that quarterly and annual profit-and-loss statements, on \nwhich their bonuses depend, could be decisively worse with a recall. They decide that on a cost-benefit basis, \nit makes more sense to wait until there are more accidents and more data. After a hundred or more accidents \nand nearly fifteen fatalities, the company institutes a selective recall, still not notifying NHTSA, which has its \nown experts and the authority to order XYZ to do a full recall of all affected models. \nExperts have advised XYZ that standard failure-analysis methodology requires that the company obtain \nabsolutely every XYZ vehicle that has experienced sudden acceleration, using microscopic analysis of all critical \ncomponents of the electronic system. The company does not wish to take that advice, as it would be—as one \ntop executive put it—“too time-consuming and expensive.” \n1. Can XYZ’s approach to this problem be justified under utilitarian theory? If so, how? If not, why not? \n2. What would Kant advise XYZ to do? Explain. \n3.

If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation. Or that he is to make \nexpenditures on reducing pollution beyond the amount that is in the best interests of the \ncorporation or that is required by law in order to contribute to the social objective of improving \nthe environment. Or that, at the expense of corporate profits, he is to hire “hardcore” unemployed \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n68 \ninstead of better qualified available workmen to contribute to the social objective of reducing \npoverty. \n \nIn each of these cases, the corporate executive would be spending someone else’s money for a \ngeneral social interest. Insofar as his actions…reduce returns to stockholders, he is spending their \nmoney. Insofar as his actions raise the price to customers, he is spending the customers’ money. \nInsofar as his actions lower the wages of some employees, he is spending their money. \n \nThis process raises political questions on two levels: principle and consequences. On the level of \npolitical principle, the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of tax proceeds are governmental \nfunctions. We have established elaborate constitutional, parliamentary, and judicial provisions to \ncontrol these functions, to assure that taxes are imposed so far as possible in accordance with the \npreferences and desires of the public.… \n \n \nOthers have challenged the notion that corporate managers have no real duties except toward the owners \n(shareholders). By changing two letters in shareholder, stakeholder theorists widened the range of people \nand institutions that a corporation should pay moral consideration to. Thus they contend that a \ncorporation, through its management, has a set of responsibilities toward nonshareholder interests. \n \nStakeholder Theory \nStakeholders of a corporation include its employees, suppliers, customers, and the community. \nStakeholder is a deliberate play on the word shareholder, to emphasize that corporations have obligations \nthat extend beyond the bottom-line aim of maximizing profits. A stakeholder is anyone who most would \nagree is significantly affected (positively or negatively) by the decision of another moral agent. \n \nThere is one vital fact about corporations: the corporation is a creation of the law. Without law (and \ngovernment), corporations would not have existence. The key concept for corporations is the legal fact of \nlimited liability. The benefit of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant that larger pools of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n69 \ncapital could be aggregated for larger enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments should \nthe venture fail in any way, and there would be no personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal \nassets other than the value of the corporate stock. Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be",

But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be \naffected by corporate decisions. \n \nAccording to stakeholder theorists, corporations (and other business organizations) must pay attention \nnot only to the bottom line but also to their overall effect on the community. Public perception of a \ncompany’s unfairness, uncaring, disrespect, or lack of trustworthiness often leads to long-term failure, \nwhatever the short-term successes or profits may be. A socially responsible corporation is likely to \nconsider the impact of its decisions on a wide range of stakeholders, not just shareholders. As Table 2.1 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n70 \n\"The Stakes of Various Stakeholders\" indicates, stakeholders have very different kinds of interests \n(“stakes”) in the actions of a corporation. \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.1 The Stakes of Various Stakeholders \nOwnership \nThe value of the organization has a direct impact on the wealth of these \nstakeholders. \nManagers \nDirectors who \nown stock \nShareholders \nEconomic \nDependence \nStakeholders can be economically dependent without having ownership. \nEach of these stakeholders relies on the corporation in some way for \nfinancial well-being. \nSalaried \nmanagers \nCreditors \nSuppliers \nEmployees \nLocal \ncommunities \nSocial Interests \nThese stakeholders are not directly linked to the organization but have \nan interest in making sure the organization acts in a socially responsible \nmanner. \nCommunities \nGovernment \nMedia \n \nCorporate Culture and Codes of Ethics \nA corporation is a “person” capable of suing, being sued, and having rights and duties in our legal system. \n(It is a legal or juridical person, not a natural person, according to our Supreme Court.) Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and",

The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year \nperiod. New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n• \nThe long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to \nmeasure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially. \n• \nSears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant \ninformation about the service being offered. This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier. Sears, like other \nsellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would \nnot permit such information distortions. \n• \nPeople in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary. \n \nNoting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had \nlost sight of other goals for the organization. \n \nThe emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical. The \ntemptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write \nthe history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done. In a way, this \nfits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. \n \nConscious Capitalism \nOne effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious \ncapitalism movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7]",

Describe two alternatives to litigation: mediation and arbitration. \n \n \nIn the United States, law and government are interdependent. The Constitution establishes the basic \nframework of government and imposes certain limitations on the powers of government. In turn, the \nvarious branches of government are intimately involved in making, enforcing, and interpreting the \nlaw. Today, much of the law comes from Congress and the state legislatures. But it is in the courts \nthat legislation is interpreted and prior case law is interpreted and applied. \n \nAs we go through this chapter, consider the case of Harry and Kay Robinson. In which court should \nthe Robinsons file their action? Can the Oklahoma court hear the case and make a judgment that will \nbe enforceable against all of the defendants? Which law will the court use to come to a decision? Will \nit use New York law, Oklahoma law, federal law, or German law? \n \n \n \nRobinson v. Audi \nHarry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. (Seaway), in \nMassena, New York, in 1976. The following year the Robinson family, who resided in New York, left that \nstate for a new home in Arizona. As they passed through Oklahoma, another car struck their Audi in the \nrear, causing a fire that severely burned Kay Robinson and her two children. Later on, the Robinsons \nbrought a products-liability action in the District Court for Creek County, Oklahoma, claiming that their \ninjuries resulted from the defective design and placement of the Audi’s gas tank and fuel system. They \nsued numerous defendants, including the automobile’s manufacturer, Audi NSU Auto Union \nAktiengesellschaft (Audi); its importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen); its regional \ndistributor, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. (World-Wide); and its retail dealer, Seaway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n82 \n \nShould the Robinsons bring their action in state court or in federal court? Over which of the defendants \nwill the court have personal jurisdiction? \n \n \n \n \n3.1 The Relationship between State and Federal Court Systems \nin the United States \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

Describe the difference between a trial court and an appellate court. \n \n \nAlthough it is sometimes said that there are two separate court systems, the reality is more complex. \nThere are, in fact, fifty-two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court system in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the federal court system. At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states. First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states.

Under \nthese circumstances, state judges will consult their own state’s case decisions involving conflicts of \nlaws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state’s laws to decide the case (see Table 3.1 \n\"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). \n \nAs state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal courts are often concerned with state law \nand with what happens in state courts. Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts. The Constitution \nestablished diversity jurisdiction because it was feared that local courts would be hostile toward \npeople from other states and that they would need separate courts. In 2009, nearly a third of all \nlawsuits filed in federal court were based on diversity of citizenship. In these cases, the federal courts \nwere applying state law, rather than taking federal question jurisdiction, where federal law \nprovided the basis for the lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or defendant). \n \nWhy are there so many diversity cases in federal courts? Defense lawyers believe that there is \nsometimes a “home-court advantage” for an in-state plaintiff who brings a lawsuit against a \nnonresident in his local state court. The defense attorney is entitled to ask for removal to a federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n84 \ncourt where there is diversity. This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial function \nhas original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to \nthem. A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in",

These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states). Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85 \nOne familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases \ninvolving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for \nconsiderably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000). The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels.

The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality\ngrew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was\nIntroduction to Finance\n1\n1 • Why It Matters\n7\ndesigned to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.\nBacon Signs’ ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the\nfirm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial",

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in.

SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live. Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\nRisk and Return in Finance\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.",

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should",

Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.\nMotivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton\nShould you lease a new car or buy one?

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks.

For example, if you purchase 13-week T-bills issued in the first week of January, each\nbill is identical to any other in the issue. Compare that to the purchase of physical assets such as a car or\nhouse, where each of the assets sold has some unique feature or measure of quality.\nFinancial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs\nissue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess\nof $100,000. These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements,\ncommercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too\nsmall to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs’ borrowing rates were affected by\nchanges in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and\nthey trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.\nTreasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes.

The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP\nmeans that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial\npaper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of\n2008.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount.

Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial\npaper until maturity.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\nmaturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other\ntypes of deposits.\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve targets the equilibrium interest rate on\n9\nHenrik Bessembinder, Chester Spatt, and Kumar Venkataraman. “A Survey of the Microstructure of Fixed-Income Markets.”\nJournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds\ninterest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds\nmarket by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending\nrates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.\nCapital Markets and Instruments\nThe capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the\nmoney market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high, and\nliquidity is less certain, as is the homogeneity of the financial instruments. Broadly, we separate capital market\ninstruments into debt instruments traded in the bond markets and equity securities traded on the stock\nmarkets.\nThe federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to raise money for current spending and to repay\npast borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large, as the US federal government over the years\nhas accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion.10\nTreasury notes are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The Treasury auctions\nnotes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they\nwould a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest\npayments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and\ntiming of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change.\nLike T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for\nTreasury notes.\nLonger-term Treasury issues, Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (“munis”).\nLocal borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.\nThus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond\nrating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest\npayments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from",

Economists attempt to understand the how and\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation.

In\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\nSome examples of these might include the following:\n•\nExpanding sales to existing customers\n•\nIncreasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\n•\nDeveloping new products for current and potential customers\n•\nBecoming international by setting up an online ordering service\nCorporate Structure and Governance\n2\n2 • Why It Matters\n39\n•\nImproving customer satisfaction with customer services\nIf managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in\nthe first place. One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that",

As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S",

S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\nRole of Management\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have\ndifferent functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits.

Every public company is legally required to install a\nboard of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\nprofits.

The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\nand regulations.\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors. It also set a requirement that the SEC issue new rulings that establish compliance with the act.\nBoard of Directors Oversight and Corporate Governance\nBecause of the widely publicized control breakdowns at Wells Fargo Bank and recent regulatory actions,\nboards of directors of public companies and financial institutions have been directed to improve oversight and\n2\nScott Vogel. “You Paid for It: AIG’s Retreat Destination, Up Close.” Washington Post.

Boards are evolving from focusing primarily on the needs of top key individuals to\nconsidering broader aspects of ethics, values, and corporate culture. Boards now oversee the monitoring\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\n•\nconfirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\n•\nverifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\n•\nensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\nverifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\n•\ncoordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its",

It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\n48\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPepsiCo\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry. It has also been noted for its excellence in\ncorporate governance. Take a look at the PepsiCo website (https://openstax.org/r/pepsico). Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long\nway to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most",

Madoff Investment Securities LLC\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\nsaves money.\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\nacting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent\noversight.\nBernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\nhad been newly invested.\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\n(Sources: Diana B.
