That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence.",

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts.

As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances.

Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwould override previous federal or state statutes. \n \nOne example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-\ndolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico. The Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments \nin 1988 spelled out certain protections for dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n25 \nbegan refusing to allow the importation of tuna that were caught using “dolphin-unfriendly” methods \n(such as purse seining). This was challenged at a GATT dispute panel in Switzerland, and the United \nStates lost. The discussion continued at the WTO under its dispute resolution process. In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective. That is, the United States may “unbind” itself \nwhenever it chooses. But for practical purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the \nnation. The argument goes something like this: if free trade in general helps the United States, then it \nmakes some sense to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite some temporary setbacks, \nthe WTO decision process will (it is hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run. This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process. Had Ross Perot \nbeen elected in 1992, for example, NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during his term \nof office. \n \nCauses of Action, Precedent, and Stare Decisis \nNo matter how wrong someone’s actions may seem to you, the only wrongs you can right in a court are \nthose that can be tied to one or more causes of action. Positive law is full of cases, treaties, statutes, \nregulations, and constitutional provisions that can be made into a cause of action. If you have an \nagreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-six trombones from you and he fails to pay for \nthem after you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will only act favorably on your \ncomplaint if you can show that his behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your state’s \ncontract law. This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n26 \nthat the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use \nto him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him. \n \nAn old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis \nnon curat lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action. If you are \nstood up for a Saturday night date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover anything in a \ncourt of law in the United States, as there is no cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can \nuse in your complaint. If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases.

How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is.

Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co., 863 F.2d 1503, 1510 (CA11 1989) (same); and \nDownes v. FAA, 775 F.2d 288, 292 (CA Fed. 1985) (same), with Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 877–\n878 (CA9 1991) (rejecting such a requirement). \n \nII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n35 \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it “an unlawful employment practice for an \nemployer…to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct \nalleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with \ndiscrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group \nworkers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. \n957,32 L. Ed. 2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of \nharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable. \n \nWe therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test.

But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.

We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.” \n \nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nSo ordered. \n \nNote to Students \n \nThis was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case. Many \nfeminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile-working-\nenvironment claims under Title VII more difficult to win. That did not happen. When the question to be \ndecided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case. Here, the question that the \ncourt poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological \ninjury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the \ncourt revisits a similar question and answers it differently. This does happen, but happens rarely. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Is this a criminal case or a civil-law case? How can you tell? \n2. Is the court concerned with making a procedural rule here, or is the court making a statement about the \nsubstantive law? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n38 \n3. Is this a case where the court is interpreting the Constitution, a federal statute, a state statute, or the \ncommon law? \n4. In Harris v. Forklift, what if the trial judge does not personally agree that women should have any rights to \nequal treatment in the workplace? Why shouldn’t that judge dismiss the case even before trial? Or should \nthe judge dismiss the case after giving the female plaintiff her day in court? \n5. What was the employer’s argument in this case? Do you agree or disagree with it? What if those who \nlegislated Title VII gave no thought to the question of seriousness of injury at all? \n \n \n \n \n1.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThere are differing conceptions of what law is and of what law should be. Laws and legal systems differ \nworldwide. The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government. The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, \npositive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies. It has also given you a brief background in common",

If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values. If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions \nwith a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities. But if I said that he was honest, \ncaring, forthright, and diligent, volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church, many \npeople would see Daniel as having certain ethical or moral qualities. If I said that he keeps the \nGolden Rule as well as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical person. But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions \nabout what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. \n2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them. \n3. Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding does not mean the same as saying a \nperson or company is ethical. \n \nHere is a cautionary note: for individuals, it is far from easy to recognize an ethical problem, have a \nclear and usable decision-making process to deal it, and then have the moral courage to do what’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n45 \nright. All of that is even more difficult within a business organization, where corporate employees \nvary in their motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character. There is no universally accepted \nway for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly \ndisagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel \nloyal and accountable to one another. \n \nBefore talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—\n“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society \noperates and is governed. \n \nHow Do Law and Ethics Differ? \nThere is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence. Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law. There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it. Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n46 \nperception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials). \n• \nThe goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale.

Describe the various major theories about ethics in human decision making. \n2. Begin considering how the major theories about ethics apply to difficult choices in life and business. \n \n \nThere are several well-respected ways of looking at ethical issues. Some of them have been around for \ncenturies. It is important to know that many who think a lot about business and ethics have deeply held \nbeliefs about which perspective is best. Others would recommend considering ethical problems from a \nvariety of different perspectives. Here, we take a brief look at (1) utilitarianism, (2) deontology, (3) social \njustice and social contract theory, and (4) virtue theory. We are leaving out some important perspectives, \nsuch as general theories of justice and “rights” and feminist thought about ethics and patriarchy. \n \nUtilitarianism \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n50 \nUtilitarianism is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is well aligned with economics and the \nfree-market outlook that has come to dominate much current thinking about business, management, and \neconomics. Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill \n(who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. \nUtilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each. The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the",

Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct \nthan achieving the right results. A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society,",

This concept was first described by Garrett Hardin in his 1968 article \"The Tragedy of the Commons\", and was later expanded upon by Elinor Ostrom in her 1990 book \"Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action\". The concept describes a situation in which individuals acting in their own self-interest, without regard for the common good, can lead to the depletion of a shared resource. In this case, the resource is the long-term benefits of society, which are being sacrificed in favor of short-term benefits. This is a classic example of the \"tragedy of the commons\", where individuals are free to use a resource without regard for the impact on others, leading to overuse and depletion. The solution to this problem is to establish rules and regulations that limit the use of the resource, and to enforce these rules through a system of incentives and penalties. This is the approach that is taken by many environmental regulations, which aim to limit the use of resources such as water, air, and energy in order to protect the long-term benefits of society."

                    "answer": "The question is asking about the assumptions that underlie cost-benefit analysis, which is a method for evaluating the costs and benefits of a decision or project. One assumption that is often made in cost-benefit analysis is that all values can be reduced to money. This means that all costs and benefits are expressed in monetary terms, and that the value of a particular cost or benefit is determined by its monetary value. This assumption can be problematic because it may not accurately reflect the true value of a cost or benefit, particularly when it comes to issues such as human health and safety. For example, a cost-benefit analysis may put a monetary value on the risks to human health or safety, but this value may not accurately reflect the true value of those risks to individuals or society as a whole. This can lead to a situation where the costs and benefits of a decision are not accurately reflected, and the decision may not be in the best interests of society. To address this issue, it may be necessary to use other methods of evaluation, such as multi-criteria decision analysis or participatory decision-making, which take into account a wider range of values and considerations. These methods can help ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of society as a whole, rather than just in terms of monetary value."

Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n54 \noften admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, \nassistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, \neducation, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security). \n \nPeople who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government \ngoods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all. One response \nmight be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in \na “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government. He called this \nthe social contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and \ncommon benefits. In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good. Your college or \nschool is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks \nbehind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, \nthe sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, \nor standards that people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free \n(though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country. \n \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules \nof smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or \nCalifornia) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be seen as a \nfundamental social contract. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n55 \nIt is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as \nthe US Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and \norganic changes. Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain \nfundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not. People can give up \nfreedom-oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches \nand seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example, many citizens in \nRussia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and \npredictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom. \n \nThus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the \nsociety.

Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

(3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate.

If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy. [2] \n \nAs to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove \nhelpful. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n58 \nMichael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core values has been \nidentified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate \ndecisions. \n \nTo simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States. \nWhen you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, \npower, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality. They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But",

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities?

A corporation is an artificial person and in this sense may have artificial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n67 \nresponsibilities, but “business” as a whole cannot be said to have responsibilities, even in this \nvague sense.… \n \nPresumably, the individuals who are to be responsible are businessmen, which means individual \nproprietors or corporate executives.…In a free enterprise, private-property system, a corporate \nexecutive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his \nemployers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which \ngenerally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the \nsociety, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.… \n \n…[T]he manager is that agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the \neleemosynary institution, and his primary responsibility is to them… \nOf course, the corporate executive is also a person in his own right. As a person, he may have \nother responsibilities that he recognizes or assumes voluntarily—to his family, his conscience, his \nfeeling of charity, his church, his clubs, his city, his country. He may feel impelled by these \nresponsibilities to devote part of his income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse to work for \nparticular corporations, even to leave his job…But in these respects he is acting as a principal, not \nan agent; he is spending his own money or time or energy, not the money of his employers or the \ntime or energy he has contracted to devote to their purposes. If these are “social responsibilities,” \nthey are the social responsibilities of individuals, not of business. \n \nWhat does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a “social responsibility” in his capacity \nas businessman? If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation. Or that he is to make \nexpenditures on reducing pollution beyond the amount that is in the best interests of the",

On the level of \npolitical principle, the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of tax proceeds are governmental \nfunctions. We have established elaborate constitutional, parliamentary, and judicial provisions to \ncontrol these functions, to assure that taxes are imposed so far as possible in accordance with the \npreferences and desires of the public.… \n \n \nOthers have challenged the notion that corporate managers have no real duties except toward the owners \n(shareholders). By changing two letters in shareholder, stakeholder theorists widened the range of people \nand institutions that a corporation should pay moral consideration to. Thus they contend that a \ncorporation, through its management, has a set of responsibilities toward nonshareholder interests. \n \nStakeholder Theory \nStakeholders of a corporation include its employees, suppliers, customers, and the community. \nStakeholder is a deliberate play on the word shareholder, to emphasize that corporations have obligations \nthat extend beyond the bottom-line aim of maximizing profits. A stakeholder is anyone who most would \nagree is significantly affected (positively or negatively) by the decision of another moral agent. \n \nThere is one vital fact about corporations: the corporation is a creation of the law. Without law (and \ngovernment), corporations would not have existence. The key concept for corporations is the legal fact of \nlimited liability. The benefit of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant that larger pools of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n69 \ncapital could be aggregated for larger enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments should \nthe venture fail in any way, and there would be no personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal \nassets other than the value of the corporate stock. Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be",

[3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and \nmodeled by the top of the organization. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n72 \n \nIt’s often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as top management is willing to make it. If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n73 \nIf you manage by the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers, based on the need to get \nstock price ever higher. At Enron, “15 percent a year or better earnings growth” was the mantra. Jeffrey \nPfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, observes how the belief that “stock \nprice is all that matters” has been hardwired into the corporate psyche. It dictates not only how people \njudge the worth of their company but also how they feel about themselves and the work that they are \ndoing. And, over time, it has clouded judgments about what is acceptable corporate behavior. [6] \n \nManaging by Numbers: The Sears Auto Center Story \nIf winning is the most important thing in your life, then you must be prepared to do anything to \nwin. \n—Michael Josephson \n \nMost people want to be winners or associate with winners. As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers. But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs. The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year",

Describe two alternatives to litigation: mediation and arbitration. \n \n \nIn the United States, law and government are interdependent. The Constitution establishes the basic \nframework of government and imposes certain limitations on the powers of government. In turn, the \nvarious branches of government are intimately involved in making, enforcing, and interpreting the \nlaw. Today, much of the law comes from Congress and the state legislatures. But it is in the courts \nthat legislation is interpreted and prior case law is interpreted and applied. \n \nAs we go through this chapter, consider the case of Harry and Kay Robinson. In which court should \nthe Robinsons file their action? Can the Oklahoma court hear the case and make a judgment that will \nbe enforceable against all of the defendants? Which law will the court use to come to a decision? Will \nit use New York law, Oklahoma law, federal law, or German law? \n \n \n \nRobinson v. Audi \nHarry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. (Seaway), in \nMassena, New York, in 1976. The following year the Robinson family, who resided in New York, left that \nstate for a new home in Arizona. As they passed through Oklahoma, another car struck their Audi in the \nrear, causing a fire that severely burned Kay Robinson and her two children. Later on, the Robinsons \nbrought a products-liability action in the District Court for Creek County, Oklahoma, claiming that their \ninjuries resulted from the defective design and placement of the Audi’s gas tank and fuel system. They \nsued numerous defendants, including the automobile’s manufacturer, Audi NSU Auto Union \nAktiengesellschaft (Audi); its importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen); its regional \ndistributor, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. (World-Wide); and its retail dealer, Seaway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n82 \n \nShould the Robinsons bring their action in state court or in federal court?

Understand the different but complementary roles of state and federal court systems. \n2. Explain why it makes sense for some courts to hear and decide only certain kinds of cases. \n3. Describe the difference between a trial court and an appellate court. \n \n \nAlthough it is sometimes said that there are two separate court systems, the reality is more complex. \nThere are, in fact, fifty-two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court system in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the federal court system. At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states. First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states.

Fourth, state \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n83 \ncourts often must consider the laws of other states in deciding cases involving issues where two \nstates have an interest, such as when drivers from two different states collide in a third state. Under \nthese circumstances, state judges will consult their own state’s case decisions involving conflicts of \nlaws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state’s laws to decide the case (see Table 3.1 \n\"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). \n \nAs state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal courts are often concerned with state law \nand with what happens in state courts. Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts. The Constitution \nestablished diversity jurisdiction because it was feared that local courts would be hostile toward \npeople from other states and that they would need separate courts. In 2009, nearly a third of all \nlawsuits filed in federal court were based on diversity of citizenship. In these cases, the federal courts \nwere applying state law, rather than taking federal question jurisdiction, where federal law \nprovided the basis for the lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or defendant). \n \nWhy are there so many diversity cases in federal courts? Defense lawyers believe that there is \nsometimes a “home-court advantage” for an in-state plaintiff who brings a lawsuit against a \nnonresident in his local state court. The defense attorney is entitled to ask for removal to a federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n84 \ncourt where there is diversity. This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial function \nhas original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to \nthem. A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in",

The field of finance is closely related to economics, as both disciplines focus on the allocation of resources and the use of money to facilitate economic activity. Finance also plays a role in the management of a company's financial resources, including the management of cash flow, budgeting, and the evaluation of investment opportunities."

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget.

However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth.

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in.

FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

Do MasterCard,\nVenmo, and PayPal make money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and\nsafer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track\nwhere and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to\ncapital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly\nbartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.\nThere are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides\na long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of\nfinancial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among\n2\nBrookings Institution. “Ben S.

Government and\nwork-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must\ntake greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let’s take a closer\nlook at some of the reasons why we study finance.\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may\npique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify\nyou for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in\nCareers in Finance.\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\nanalytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live. Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\nRisk and Return in Finance\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk.

A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\n12\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even\nnationalization of a firm or industry.\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n13\n1.2\nThe Role of Finance in an Organization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the finance function.\n•\nExplain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.\nThe Finance Function\nFinance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job\nresponsibilities.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation.

Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making.

Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a\nnew product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family.

Providing data-supported strategic planning and visioning 5. Ensuring consistent data and content across departments 6. Motivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives"

However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

                    "answer": "The unemployment rate is a measure of the number of people who are currently unemployed and looking for work. It is an important indicator of the health of the economy and can provide insight into the demand for labor in a given industry. The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the total number of people in the labor force. The unemployment rate can help financial forecasters assess the cost of labor and the ability of employers to hire people to meet their production needs. For example, if the unemployment rate is high, it may indicate that there is a surplus of labor and employers may be able to hire workers at a lower cost. Conversely, if the unemployment rate is low, it may indicate that there is a shortage of labor and employers may have to pay higher wages to attract workers. Additionally, the unemployment rate can help financial forecasters assess the demand for labor in a given industry. For example, if the unemployment rate is high in an industry, it may indicate that there is a surplus of labor and employers may be able to hire workers at a lower cost.

The stock market is a capital market that allows investors to buy and sell shares of companies. The stock market is a forward-looking variable because it reflects investors' expectations about future cash flows and economic growth.

Conversely, if investors believe that a company will generate weak future cash flows and economic growth, the stock price of that company will likely decrease. The stock market is a macroeconomic variable because it reflects the overall economic health of a country or region. For example, if the stock market is doing well, it may indicate that the economy is growing and that investors are optimistic about the future.

The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union).

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds\ninterest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds\nmarket by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending\nrates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.\nCapital Markets and Instruments\nThe capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the\nmoney market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high, and\nliquidity is less certain, as is the homogeneity of the financial instruments. Broadly, we separate capital market\ninstruments into debt instruments traded in the bond markets and equity securities traded on the stock\nmarkets.\nThe federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to raise money for current spending and to repay\npast borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large, as the US federal government over the years\nhas accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion.10\nTreasury notes are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The Treasury auctions\nnotes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they\nwould a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest\npayments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and\ntiming of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change.\nLike T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for\nTreasury notes.\nLonger-term Treasury issues, Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (“munis”).\nLocal borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.\nThus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond\nrating based on the perceived default risk.

Market values are the\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon\nSigns planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when\ncreating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have\nmultiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client.

There are three broad areas of finance:\nbusiness finance, investments, and financial markets and institutions.\n1.2 The Role of Finance in an Organization\nThe accounting department creates financial statements, and the finance department implements the firm’s\npolicy objectives, monitors results, and responds to necessary strategic and tactical changes. Finance is\nresponsible for budgeting and forecasting. Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for\nmeeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or\nhave a claim against firm assets.\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\nMuch of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\nfor their stakeholders.\n1.4 Careers in Finance\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\nto manufacturing, to education.\n1.5 Markets and Participants\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an\nindividual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.\nEconomics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial\nforecasting.\n1.7 Financial Instruments\nMaturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments.

            "chunk": "end, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in\nthe company’s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S",

The advantages of a sole proprietorship include:\n\n1. Simplicity: Sole proprietorships are relatively easy to set up and operate. There is no need to file paperwork with the government or obtain permission from anyone.\n\n2. Flexibility: Sole proprietors have complete control over their businesses. They can make decisions quickly and without having to consult with anyone else.\n\n3. Low cost: Sole proprietorships are generally less expensive to start and operate than other types of businesses.\n\n4. Personal liability: Sole proprietors are personally liable for all debts and obligations of their businesses. This can be both a benefit and a drawback.\n\n5. Tax advantages: Sole proprietors can deduct business expenses on their personal tax returns.\n\n6.

First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\nRole of Management\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have\ndifferent functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is",

It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\n48\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPepsiCo\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry. It has also been noted for its excellence in\ncorporate governance. Take a look at the PepsiCo website (https://openstax.org/r/pepsico). Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors.

In the field of corporate finance, agency problems are often related to a conflict of interest\nbetween the management of a company and its shareholders.\nFor many years, this has been a very common problem that has been seen in nearly every kind of organization,\nirrespective of it being a church, a club, a not-for-profit organization, a multinational corporation, or any other\ngovernment agency or institution. As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be\nresolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.\nEvery company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and\npersonal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders\n(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own\nwealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the\ngoodwill of the shareholder base.\nThere are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nExample of an Agency Problem\nABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the\nselling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own\npersonal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price\nof the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.\nAdditionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall\nquality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced\nbetween stockholders and loyal customers of the company.\nStockholders versus Management\nLarge corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential\nfor an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type\nof agency problem.\nSegregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not\nhave any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts\nand professionals to manage key operations of the business.\nHowever, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.\nExternal managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even\n50\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmisusing company funds. This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate",

From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\nInvestors versus Creditors\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\npossible default.\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\nstakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.\nIf such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the\norganization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the\ncompany as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus\nother stakeholders.\nA more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift\nbasket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.4 This was a direct result of the company\nbeing purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of\ndebt. However, the most important factor leading to the company’s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer,\nwho was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant\nexecutive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry & David has since emerged\nfrom bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen\nwhen stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate\nenvironment.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nInfamous Agency Problems\nEnron\nEnron is one particularly infamous example of an agency problem. Enron’s directors were responsible for\nprotecting and promoting investor interests, but they failed to carry out their regulatory and oversight\nresponsibilities, enabling the company to venture into illegal activity.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\nsaves money.\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\nacting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent\noversight.\nBernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\nhad been newly invested.\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\n(Sources: Diana B.

When perpetuated, these differences may\neventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative\nthat they address the underlying problems of these differences. This will help ensure that normal business\noperations are not being adversely impacted by the agency problem.\nWhile there is no surefire way to resolve all conflicts of interest and agency problems, some measures that can\n52\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nhelp mitigate such issues include the following:\n•\nOffering incentives to management for strong performance and ethical behavior\n•\nAwarding decision makers with stock packages, commissions, and other long-term compensation\npackages to encourage long-term thinking and matching of company objectives with shareholders’\npriorities\n•\nPenalizing poor performance, shortsightedness, and unethical behavior\nThe prevailing belief in agency theory is that when a business creates organizational incentives that encourage\nhard work on projects that will benefit the company in both the short and long term, more employees will be\nencouraged to act in the business’s best interest.\nAnother means of resolving agency problems is through a hostile takeover of the organization. Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any",
