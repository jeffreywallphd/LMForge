            "chunk": "there are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory. Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence.",

When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes,",

Examples of ordinances include local building codes, \nzoning laws, and misdemeanors or infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking. Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality\ngrew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was\nIntroduction to Finance\n1\n1 • Why It Matters\n7\ndesigned to meet anticipated capital requirements so that the firm could expand how and when it needed to.\nBacon Signs’ ability to manufacture and deliver a high-quality product at a good price was the true value of the\nfirm. However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial",

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged.

FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

                    "answer": "The Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by reorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important financial institutions.
