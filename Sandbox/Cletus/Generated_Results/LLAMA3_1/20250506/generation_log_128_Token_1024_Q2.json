The Constitution of the United States, written in 1787, created a system of government that was designed to balance power between three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The Constitution established a federal government, which is a system of government that divides power between a central government and state governments. In the United States, the federal government is composed of three branches: the legislative branch, which makes laws; the executive branch, which carries out the laws; and the judicial branch, which interprets the laws. The Constitution also established a system of checks and balances to ensure that no one branch of government would become too powerful. The legislative branch is composed of two parts: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives has 435 members, who are elected to two-year terms by the people of their states. The Senate has 100 members, who are elected to six-year terms by the people of their states. The House of Representatives is responsible for passing laws, while the Senate is responsible for ratifying treaties and confirming presidential appointments. The executive branch is headed by the president, who is elected to a four-year term by the people of the United States. The president is responsible for carrying out the laws passed by Congress and for appointing federal judges and other officials. The judicial branch is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the land, and lower federal courts. The Supreme Court is composed of nine justices, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The Supreme Court is responsible for interpreting the laws and the Constitution."
