                    "question": "How do companies determine their optimal capital structure?",
                    "answer": "Companies determine their optimal capital structure by balancing the costs and benefits of different sources of financing. On one hand, debt financing is generally less expensive than equity financing, but it also carries the risk of default and bankruptcy. On the other hand, equity financing is more expensive, but it provides a more stable source of funding. Companies must weigh these trade-offs and make decisions based on their specific circumstances."
