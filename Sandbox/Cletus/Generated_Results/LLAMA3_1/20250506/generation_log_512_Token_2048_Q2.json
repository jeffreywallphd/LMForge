This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1.

Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \nauthoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \nor political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism, \nEuropean nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \nthose same European nations.

The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed.

Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource. Which school of legal thought does \nher criticism reflect? \n2. Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” \nWhich school of legal thought is represented by this quote? \n3. Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard \nunder Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual \nextermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald. After an Israeli “extraction team” took him \nfrom Argentina to Israel, he was put on trial for “crimes against humanity.” His defense was that he was \n“just following orders.” Explain why Eichmann was not an adherent of the natural-law school of legal \nthought.",
