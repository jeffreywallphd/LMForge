This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers.",

                    "question": "Why do firms issue debt? ",
                    "answer": "Firms issue debt because it is a relatively cheap source of financing. Debt has a fixed interest rate, which makes it a cheaper source of financing than equity, which has a variable interest rate. Debt also has a lower tax rate than equity, which makes it a more attractive source of financing for firms. Additionally, debt can be used to finance specific projects, which can be a more efficient use of capital than financing all projects with equity. Finally, debt can be used to reduce the risk of the firm's equity, which can make the firm more attractive to investors."
