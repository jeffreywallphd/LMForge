(An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple.

                    "answer": "A nongovernment organization, or NGO, is an organization that is independent from government control and is usually created by private individuals. NGOs can be very diverse, but they often focus on social and political issues. NGOs can be very powerful and influential, and they can often have a significant impact on government policy. Many people are active in NGOs, and they often contribute to them financially. NGOs often espouse a variety of rights, including the right to freedom of speech, the right to freedom of assembly, and the right to freedom of religion. NGOs often support laws that protect these rights, and they often oppose laws that infringe on these rights. "
