This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve. \n3. Explain how politics and law are related. \n4. Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws.",

Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by \nSpain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \ninternational community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet \nUnion, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders. \nWhen Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly \nfor home turf rather than share power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups \nof families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be \nseen. \n \nLaw and Politics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n5 \nIn the United States, legislators, judges, administrative agencies, governors, and presidents make law, \nwith substantial input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle Association. In \nthe fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people. The process of electing \nstate judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign \ncontributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings. \n \nIn the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other \nelected officials (the Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of \nSenate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes. Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make",

Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or",
