Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”).

For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate.

Explain why it is difficult to establish and maintain an ethical corporate culture in a business \norganization. \n \n \nFew subjects are more contentious or important as the role of business in society, particularly, \nwhether corporations have social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing shareholder \nvalue. While the phrase “business ethics” is not oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is \nplenty of evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out primarily for themselves. However, \nbusiness organizations ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers, employees, the \nmedia, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government officials, and socially responsible \ninvestors at their peril. Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term interests of many \ncompanies, who find that sustainable profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as \nwell as profits. \n \nThis chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential businesspeople to the differences \nbetween legal compliance and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical perspectives \nthat apply to business, businesspeople, and the role of business organizations in society. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n43", "label": 1}

We will venture a \ndefinition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms. \nPeople often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of \ncorporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation. For example, if North Korea is characterized by the US \npresident as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in \ncertain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n44", "label": 1}

If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values. If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart?

But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions \nabout what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. \n2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them. \n3.

All of that is even more difficult within a business organization, where corporate employees \nvary in their motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character. There is no universally accepted \nway for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly \ndisagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel \nloyal and accountable to one another. \n \nBefore talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—\n“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society \noperates and is governed. \n \nHow Do Law and Ethics Differ? \nThere is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence.

There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it.

(This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view.

If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views.

But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights.

In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good?", "label": 1}

A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold.", "label": 1}

This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy.

Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate.

It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied.

These include the US Tax Court, \nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims. \n \nUnited States Supreme Court \nOverseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC. It consists of nine justices—the \nchief justice and eight associate justices. (This number is not constitutionally required; Congress can \nestablish any number. It has been set at nine since after the Civil War.) The Supreme Court has selective \ncontrol over most of its docket.

The big difference after 1789 was \nthat state courts coexisted with federal courts. Federalism was the system devised by the nation’s \nfounders in which power is shared between states and the federal government. This sharing requires a \ndivision of labor between the states and the federal government.

Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter.

The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court.

There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution, even though federal agencies \nare sometimes referred to as “the fourth branch of government.” The Supreme Court has recognized the \nlegitimacy of federal administrative agencies to make rules that have the same binding effect as \nstatutes by Congress. \n \nMost commentators note that having agencies with rule-making power is a practical necessity: (1) \nCongress does not have the expertise or continuity to develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g., \ncommunications, the environment, aviation).

To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments.

For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent", "label": 1}

When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.)

Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime?

Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247", "label": 1}

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny.

Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him.

This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying.

Describe the basic steps in pretrial criminal procedure that follow a government's determination to arrest \nsomeone for an alleged criminal act. \n2. Describe the basic elements of trial and posttrial criminal procedure. \n \n \nThe procedure for criminal prosecutions is complex. Procedures will vary from state to state. A \ncriminal case begins with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing from the scene; if \nthe defendant is not caught, a warrant for the defendant’s arrest will issue. The warrant is issued by a \njudge or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge of a specific crime against the \naccused. It is not enough for a police officer to go before a judge and say, “I’d like you to arrest \nBonnie because I think she’s just murdered Clyde.” She must supply enough information to satisfy \nthe magistrate that there is probable cause (reasonable grounds) to believe that the accused \ncommitted the crime.

The warrant will be issued to any officer or agency that has power to arrest the \naccused with warrant in hand. \n \nThe accused will be brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing. The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis.

The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment.

Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited.

In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff \nwill have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n264", "label": 1}

This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.

The debate over the limits of this right \nhas given rise to an immense literature. In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means \nthat the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the \njury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded \nfrom evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession). \nIn Miranda v.

Most criminal law requires a specific \nintent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern \nlegislation, dispense with the requirement of intent). In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies. Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors. Most people have a \ngeneral notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft. But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit", "label": 1}

If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense.

The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other.

Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery.

Two men ran forward to catch it. One of the men \nreached the platform of the car without mishap, though the train was already moving.

A guard on the car, \nwho had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed \nhim from behind.

Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few.

Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, \ndid a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with modem capitalism. \n \nContract Defined \nAs usual in the law, the legal definition of “contract” is formalistic. The Restatement says: “A contract is \na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which \nthe law in some way recognizes as a duty.” (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 1) Similarly, the \nUniform Commercial Code says: “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the \nparties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.” (Section 1-201(11)) A \nshort-hand definition is: “A contract is a legally enforceable promise.”", "label": 1}

Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books", "label": 1}

By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law. One of its first projects, and ultimately one of its most \nsuccessful, was the drafting of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts, completed in 1932.

A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on.

The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v.

First, the UCC is more liberal than the common law in \nupholding the existence of a contract. For example, in a sales contract (covered by the UCC), “open” \nterms—that is, those the parties have not agreed upon—do not require a court to rule that no contract was \nmade. However, open terms in a nonsales contract will frequently result in a ruling that there is no \ncontract. Second, although the common law of contracts applies to every person equally, under the UCC \n“merchants” occasionally receive special treatment.

First, the Convention is a uniform law governing the sale \nof goods—in effect, an international Uniform Commercial Code. The major goal of the drafters was to \nproduce a uniform law acceptable to countries with different legal, social and economic systems. Second, \nalthough provisions in the Convention are generally consistent with the UCC, there are significant \ndifferences. For instance, under the Convention, consideration (discussed below) is not required to form a \ncontract and there is no Statute of Frauds (a requirement that some contracts be evidenced by a writing to \nbe enforceable—also discussed below). Finally, the Convention represents the first attempt by the US \nSenate to reform the private law of business through its treaty powers, for the Convention preempts the \nUCC if the parties to a contract elect to use the CISG. \n \nBasic Contract Taxonomy \nContracts are not all cut from the same die.

In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement.

By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him.

Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car.

An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.)

Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you. \nA voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing.

(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out.

A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods).

For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed.

That may seem a simple enough question. But as with much in the law, the \ncomplicating situations are never very far away. The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor.

Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—\nis carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents.

Indeed, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each \npartner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the \ncorporation. \n \nThe existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature.

His agency task—of interest here—was celebrated in Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow’s “The Courtship of Miles Standish.” He was to woo Priscilla Mullins (d. 1680), \n“the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,” on behalf of Captain Miles Standish, a valiant soldier who was too shy \nto propose marriage. Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady. But Alden was so tongue-tied that his vaunted eloquence fell short, turned Priscilla cold toward \nthe object of Alden’s mission, and eventually led her to turn the tables in one of the most famous lines in \nAmerican literature and poetry: “Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?” John eventually did: the two \nwere married in 1623 in Plymouth. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency \nLet’s analyze this sequence of events in legal terms—recognizing, of course, that this example is an \nanalogy and that the law, even today, would not impose consequences on Alden for his failure to carry out", "label": 1}

He had, however, a conflict of interest. He attempted to carry out the assignment, \nbut he did not perform according to expectations. Eventually, he wound up with the prize himself. Here \nare some questions to consider, the same questions that will recur throughout the discussion of agency: \n \n• \nHow extensive was John’s authority? Could he have made promises to Priscilla on the captain’s \nbehalf—for example, that Standish would have built her a fine house? \n• \nCould he, if he committed a tort, have imposed liability on his principal?

It therefore deals with three different relationships: between principal and agent, between principal \nand third party, and between agent and third party. These relationships can be summed up in a simple \ndiagram (see Figure 9.1 \"Agency Relationships\"). \n \nFigure 9.1 Agency Relationships \n \n \nIn this chapter, we will consider the principal-agent side of the triangle.

To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner.

For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer \nfor his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam.

By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents.

Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor.

A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation.

Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing.

If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal.

The agency \nrelationship then is said to have been implied “by operation of law.” Children in most states may purchase \nnecessary items—food or medical services—on the parent’s account. Long-standing social policy deems it \ndesirable for the head of a family to support his dependents, and the courts will put the expense on the \nfamily head in order to provide for the dependents’ welfare. The courts achieve this result by supposing \nthe dependent to be the family head’s agent, thus allowing creditors to sue the family head for the debt. \n \nImplied agencies also arise where one person behaves as an agent would and the “principal,” knowing that \nthe “agent” is behaving so, acquiesces, allowing the person to hold himself out as an agent.

Many transactions are conducted by agents so acting. All \ncorporate transactions, including those involving governmental organizations, are so conducted because \ncorporations cannot themselves actually act; they are legal fictions. Agencies may be created expressly, \nimpliedly, or apparently. Recurring issues in agency law include whether the “agent” really is such, the scope \nof the agent’s authority, and the duties among the parties.

But these general duties are not unique to agency law; they are duties owed by any \nemployee to the employer. \n \nFiduciary Duty \nIn a nonagency contractual situation, the parties’ responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. \nThere is no relationship beyond the agreement. This literalist approach is justified by the more general \nprinciple that we each should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular course. \n \nBut the agency relationship is more than a contractual one, and the agent’s responsibilities go beyond the \nborder of the contract. Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty.

How agency relationships are terminated \n \n \nIn Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\" we considered the relationships between \nagent and principal. Now we turn to relationships between third parties and the principal or agent. \nWhen the agent makes a contract for his principal or commits a tort in the course of his work, is the \nprincipal liable? What is the responsibility of the agent for torts committed and contracts entered \ninto on behalf of his principal? How may the relationship be terminated so that the principal or agent \nwill no longer have responsibility toward or liability for the acts of the other? These are the questions \naddressed in this chapter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.1 Principal’s Contract Liability \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority \nThe strongest form of authority is that which is expressly granted, often in written form.

Even a special agent’s duties are difficult to describe in such detail as to leave him without \ndiscretion.

The second approach to placing liability on the owner is \njudicial and known as the family purpose doctrine. Under this doctrine, a family member who \nnegligently injures someone with the car subjects the owner to liability if the family member was \nfurthering family purposes. These are loosely defined to include virtually every use to which a child, for \nexample, might put a car. In a Georgia case, Dixon v. Phillips, the father allowed his minor son to drive \nthe car but expressly forbade him from letting anyone else do so. [2] Nevertheless, the son gave the wheel \nto a friend and a collision occurred while both were in the car. The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction", "label": 1}

This ancient view has been abrogated by statute or by court ruling in all the states, so \nthat now a wife is solely responsible for her own torts unless she in fact serves as her husband’s agent. \n \nUnlike wives, children are not presumed at common law to be agents or extensions of the father so that \nnormally parents are not vicariously liable for their children’s torts. However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers.

An example is the \n“Dramshop Act,” which in many states subjects the owner of a bar to liability if the bar continues to serve \nan intoxicated patron who later is involved in an accident while intoxicated. Another example involves the \nsale of adulterated or short-weight foodstuffs: the employer of one who sells such may be liable, even if \nthe employer did not know of the sales. \n \nPrincipal’s Criminal Liability \nAs a general proposition, a principal will not be held liable for an agent’s unauthorized criminal acts if the \ncrimes are those requiring specific intent.

So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal. Who may enforce the contracts against them? \n \nThe developer and the agents may sue to compel transfer of title. The undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal may act to enforce his rights unless the contract specifically prohibits it or there is a \nrepresentation that the signatories are not signing for an undisclosed principal.

That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there \nwas a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may \nstill recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior \nto winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the \nplaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway. Similarly, if the \nseller sues the principal and recovers a judgment, the agents are relieved of liability.

But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades.

[2] The NCCUL \nobserves in its “prefatory note” to the 1997 act: “The Revised Act is largely a series of ‘default rules’ that \ngovern the relations among partners in situations they have not addressed in a partnership agreement. \nThe primary focus of RUPA is the small, often informal, partnership.

When individuals carry out a common enterprise \nas partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said \nno. In other words, under the common-law theory, a partnership was but a convenient name for an \naggregate of individuals, and the rights and duties recognized and imposed by law are those of the \nindividual partners. By contrast, the mercantile theory of the law merchant held that a partnership is a \nlegal entity that can have rights and duties independent of those of its members. \n \nDuring the drafting of the 1914 UPA, a debate raged over which theory to adopt. The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460 \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit”) and retained the \ncommon-law theory that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals—the aggregate theory. \n \nRUPA moved more toward making partnerships entities.

In contrast to the corporation, which is the creature of \nstatute, partnership is a catchall term for a large variety of working relationships, and frequently, \nuncertainties arise about whether or not a particular relationship is that of partnership. The law can \nreduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price of severely restricting the flexibility of people to \nassociate. As the chief drafter of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA, 1914) explained, \n \nAll other business associations are statutory in origin. They are formed by the happening of an \nevent designated in a statute as necessary to their formation. In corporations this act may be the \nissuing of a charter by the proper officer of the state; in limited partnerships, the filing by the \nassociates of a specified document in a public office. On the other hand, an infinite number of \ncombinations of circumstances may result in co-ownership of a business. Partnership is the \nresiduum, including all forms of co-ownership, of a business except those business associations \norganized under a specific statute.

Employment Security Commission), a number of tests have \nbeen established that are clues to the existence of a partnership (see Figure 11.1 \"Partnership Tests\"). We \nreturn to the definition of a partnership: “the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners \na business for profit[.]” The three elements are (1) the association of persons, (2) as co-owners, (3) for \nprofit. \n \nAssociation of Persons \nThis element is pretty obvious. A partnership is a contractual agreement among persons, so the persons \ninvolved need to have capacity to contract. But RUPA does not provide that only natural persons can be \npartners; it defines person as follows: “‘Person’ means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, \ntrust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or", "label": 1}
{"pdf_file": "Documents/Legal Aspects of Corporate Management and Finance.pdf", "chunk_id": "Legal Aspects of Corporate Management and Finance.pdf_chunk_896", "text": "trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or \ninstrumentality, or any other legal or commercial entity.” [3] Thus unless state law precludes it, a \ncorporation can be a partner in a partnership. The same is true under UPA. \n \nCo-owners of a Business \nIf what two or more people own is clearly a business—including capital assets, contracts with employees \nor agents, an income stream, and debts incurred on behalf of the operation—a partnership exists. A \ntougher question arises when two or more persons co-own property. Do they automatically become \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n468 \npartners? The answer can be important: if one of the owners while doing business pertinent to the \nproperty injures a stranger, the latter could sue the other owners if there is a partnership. \n \nCo-ownership comes in many guises. The four most common are joint tenancy, tenancy in common, \ntenancy by the entireties, and community property. In joint tenancy, the owners hold the property under a \nsingle instrument, such as a deed, and if one dies, the others automatically become owners of the \ndeceased’s share, which does not descend to his heirs.

The tenancy by the entirety and community property (in community-property states) forms of \nownership are limited to spouses, and their effects are similar to that of joint tenancy. \n \nSuppose a husband and wife who own their home as tenants by the entirety (or community property) \ndecide to spend the summer at the seashore and rent their home for three months. Is their co-ownership \nsufficient to establish that they are partners? The answer is no. By UPA Section 7(2) and RUPA Section \n202(b)(1), the various forms of joint ownership by themselves do not establish partnership, whether or \nnot the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property. To establish a partnership, the ownership \nmust be of a business, not merely of property. \n \nSharing of Profits \nThere are two aspects to consider with regard to profits: first, whether the business is for-profit, and \nsecond, whether there is a sharing of the profit. \n \nBusiness for Profit \nUnincorporated nonprofit organizations (UNAs) cannot be partnerships.

Of the tests used by courts to determine co-ownership, \nperhaps the most important is sharing of profits. Section 202(c) of RUPA provides that “a person who \nreceives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business,” but this \npresumption can be rebutted by showing that the share of the profits paid out was (1) to repay a debt; (2) \nwages or compensation to an independent contractor; (3) rent; (4) an annuity, retirement, or health \nbenefit to a representative of a deceased or retired partner; (5) interest on a loan, or rights to income, \nproceeds, or increase in value from collateral; or (5) for the sale of the goodwill of a business or other \nproperty. Section 7(4) of UPA is to the same effect. \n \nOther Factors \nCourts are not limited to the profit-sharing test; they also look at these factors, among others: the right to \nparticipate in decision making, the duty to share liabilities, and the manner in which the business is", "label": 1}

See, e.g. [Citations]. In chapter 13, this principle is particularly important because Congress \nadopted the liberal “superdischarge” provisions of § 1328 as an incentive to debtors to commit to a plan to \npay their creditors all of their disposable income over a period of years rather than simply discharging \ntheir debts in a chapter 7 liquidation.", "label": 1}

The trustee has \ncertain powers to recover property for the estate that the debtor transferred before bankruptcy. These \ninclude the power to act as a hypothetical lien creditor, to avoid fraudulent transfers and voidable \npreferences. \n \nThe bankruptcy act sets out categories of claimants and establishes priority among them.

The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth.

Chapter 1 describes the firm management process—a \nprocess that includes identifying the firm’s mission statement and strategic (long term) goals and tac­\ntical (short term) objectives; identifying the firm’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats; \nidentifying and evaluating alternative strategies; and finally implementing and evaluating the preferred \nstrategy. Chapter 1 notes that the management process has wide application including managing the \nfinancial resources of the small to medium-size firm. \nThe firm’s opportunities and threats are most often nested in factors outside the firm’s control. For \nexample, different ways to organize the firm (Chapter 2) and the tax environment facing the firm \n(Chapter 3) are factors external to the firm. They are important to discuss, though, because the firm \ncan adopt different responses to the legal and tax environment in which it operates. \nWe live in and make financial decisions in a world of risk and uncertainty.

However, there are other risk responses the firm can employ. Learning \nabout risk and applying this knowledge to the purchase of insurance and adopting other risk manage­\nment alternatives is the focus of Chapter 4. Some of the concepts covered in Chapter 4 are essential \nstatistical tools needed to plan and make important decisions in a risky and uncertain world. \nPart II: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats \nChapters in Part II focus on the internal financial strengths and weaknesses of the firm and its ability \nto respond to external opportunities and threats. Chapter 5 focuses on the construction, analysis, and \ninterpretation of coordinated financial statements (CFS).

While the data used in the finan­\ncial management process and the construction of financial statements are most often assumed to be \nobtainable and accurate, the reality may be quite different. Small to medium-sized firms often lack \nthe financial records required to conduct the analyses described in Part II of this book. Acquiring \nand sometimes guesstimating the missing data is almost an art form—a process that forms the nexus \nbetween theory and practice. \nAn important lesson to be learned about financial statements—even when we can construct them \naccurately—is that financial statements alone do not completely reveal the financial strengths and \nweaknesses of the firm. A more complete view of the firm’s strengths and weaknesses requires ratios \nbe constructed using data included in the firm’s CFS (Chapter 6).

An important characteristic of an open system is that \nits parts are connected internally with endogenous variables and externally—to factors outside of the \nfirm—with exogenous variables. Therefore, a change in one or more of the firm’s exogenous variables \ncan change conditions inside the firm described by its endogenous variables. \nBecause CFS are a system, we can analyze the firm’s opportunities and threats presented by forces \noutside the firm. For example, we can ask: what if there is a change in the firm’s exogenous variables? \nThen, how will the financial condition of the firm change?

The firm’s mission statement explains why \nthe firm exists and what it values. The mission statement may also establish criteria for selecting activ­\nities in which the firm will participate. Mission statements might also describe the firm’s customers, \nthe markets in which it will participate, and the firm’s social responsibilities. Mission statements are \noften succinct, short, easy to express and remember, clear, and flexible enough to describe the entire \nrange of the firm’s activities. For example, a mission for a vegetable farm may be: “our mission is to pro­\nvide wholesome and safe vegetables grown in an environmentally healthy and worker-friendly envi­\nronment.”", "label": 1}

Motives spring from \nphysical and socio-emotional needs and the relative importance of these motives will determine how \nthe firm manages its resources to satisfy its needs. Therefore, the relative importance of the financial \nmanager’s motives should be reflected in the mission statement. To illustrate, motives may reflect the \nneed to increase one’s own consumption, to act in accordance with one’s internalized set of values, to \nearn the good will of others, to increase one’s sense of belonging in one’s community or other orga­\nnizations, and to improve the well-being of a disadvantaged group. The mission statement needs to \nguide the firm’s efforts to manage its resources depending on the relative importance of these com­\npeting motives. \nOne word sometimes associated with management is the word “vision.” Vision is the ability to imagine \nor picture, in one’s mind, something that has not yet been created physically. Therefore, vision is a nec­\nessary condition for any kind of physical creation because we must create an event, outcome, or thing", "label": 1}

An architect must imagine a building and reflect that \nvision in plans which the builders will follow to create a building. A football coach imagines an offensive \nplay and reflects it in a drawing before it can be executed in a game. A financial manager must imagine \na project that will produce valued outcomes before committing time, energy, and other resources to \nthe project. A vision of what the manager wants the firm to achieve is reflected in the firm’s mission \nstatement. A biblical expression highlights the importance of vision: “where there is no vision, the peo­\nple perish…” (Proverbs 29:18). \nSo, what have we learned?  We learned that the management process begins with a vision \nthat describes what the firm wants to do and become.  Without a vision, the firm is \nunlikely to succeed. \nFinancial Management and the Firm  |  5\nChoose the Firm’s Strategic Goals and Tactical Objectives \nStrategic goals set the long-term direction of the firm.

The objectives consistent with this goal may be to develop new \nproducts, to focus on a marketing strategy, or to increase the firm’s sales force. The firm’s objectives \ntransform the firm’s strategic goals into an action plan. Tactical objectives describe what short term \nactions are required if the firm is to reach its long-term goals. \nThe importance of goals and objectives \nThere are at least four reasons management requires the firm to choose goals and objectives: \n1. Firm goals and objectives express what the firm believes is possible and desirable to achieve. By \nchoosing the firm’s goals and objectives, the manager is expressing confidence in what the firm \ncan achieve.

Therefore, firm goals and objectives provide criteria for making choices, the \nsecond reason for setting goals and objectives. \n3. Most firms include multiple actors with diverse assignments.

Good goals and objectives \ncan be achieved with the wise use of resources available to the firm and the environment in \nwhich it exists. \n2. Good goals and objectives answer the question: “What must the firm do to achieve its mission?” \nGoals and objectives that are consistent with the firm’s mission statement provide the criteria for \nthe management of the firm’s energy and resources. If the firm goals and objectives fail to provide \nsuch criteria, then other goals and objectives should be selected. \n3. Good goals and objectives reflect a consensus among those tasked with achieving them. People \nwork hard for money. But they work harder when they feel they are part of a team—that their \ncontributions are valued. Thus, good goals and objectives are the product of serious discussions \nintended to produce a consensus among those involved in reaching them. Therefore, at the end \nof the day, good goals and objectives provide a focus for synergistic efforts. \n4. Finally, progress toward the achievement of good goals and objectives can be measured.

If the measures signal that \nthe firm is not making adequate progress, then the firm is supported in its efforts to change \ndirections. \nSo, what have we learned? We learned that to realize the firm’s vision we must choose \ngoals that are realistic, describe what needs to be done, reflect a consensus, and can be \nmeasured. We need goals because they reflect what we believe is possible, they provide \ncriteria for choosing between alternatives, they provide a rallying point for firm members \nto work together, and they provide measures against which performance can be evaluated. \nFinancial Management and the Firm  |  7\nIdentify the Firm’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and \nThreats. \nBefore developing strategies to accomplish the firm’s goals and objectives, a manager needs to identify \nand evaluate the internal strengths and weaknesses of the firm.

The implementation stage of financial management may include interacting with capital mar­\nkets to raise funds required to support a strategy. Managers decide whether to acquire funds internally \nor borrow from other investors, commercial banks, the Farm Credit System, life insurance companies, \nor, depending on how the firm is organized, by issuing stocks or bonds. \nIn the process of obtaining and allocating funds, financial managers interact directly or indirectly with \nfinancial markets. This interaction could be simply obtaining a savings or checking account at your \nlocal bank. Or it could involve more sophisticated interactions such as raising funds by issuing owner­\nship (equity) claims in your firm in the form of shares of stock. \nAnother part of implementing the financial strategy of the firm is to interact with various parts of", "label": 1}

In addition, financial managers must make trade-offs between \nrisks and expected returns. One tool that can be used to evaluate future returns and risk is the term \nstructure of interest rates, the subject of Chapter 21. There are other kinds of trade-offs as well. One \nimportant trade-ff is between commodities and relational goods. We will need both because they each \nsatisfy different needs. This book is mostly about managing commodities, but Chapter 22 reminds us \nthat “money can’t buy love” or relational goods.

A sole pro­\nprietorship is a business that is owned and operated by a single individual. Most sole proprietorships \nare family-owned businesses. The advantages of a sole proprietorship business include: \n1. It is easy and inexpensive to form and operate administratively (simplicity); \n2. It offers the maximum managerial control; and \n3. Business income is taxed as ordinary (personal) income to the owner. \nThe disadvantages of the sole proprietorship include:", "label": 1}

The company’s life is determined by the life of the owner. \nSole proprietorships are typically organized informally and require relatively little paperwork to begin \noperations. It is the most simple among the alternative business organizations to understand and use. \nTo begin operation, the individual declares himself/herself to be a business. In many cases, a license \nwill be required to operate the business, but often the business begins simply by “opening its door.” \nThe day-to-day operations of the firm are also organized informally and may be administered as the \nowner desires, subject to legal and tax restrictions. For example, certain taxes must be paid by spe­\ncific dates. The vast majority of regulations small businesses face are independent of the legal form of \nthe business. Metrics such as business size, number of employees, and location often determine which \nregulations businesses face.", "label": 1}

While the large amount of owner \ncontrol can be a strength in small firms, it often turns out to be a disadvantage as firms begin to grow \nand the owner is no longer able to manage all aspects of the business. The owner must then hire com­\npetent staff to manage specific aspects of the business. \nSole proprietor business resources equal those available to the owner.

Limited partnerships have some partners \n(limited partners) who possess limited liability; limited partners do not participate in management of \nthe firm.

For example, suppose a corporation, whose owner­\nship is divided among its 3000 shareholders, earns $1,000,000 in taxable profits for the \nyear and is in a flat 40-percent tax bracket. Profits per share equal $1,000,000/3000—or \n$333.33. The corporation pays 40% of $1,000,000—or $400,000—in taxes to the govern­\nment.

Of course, “the firm” could mean any business organization ranging from a large corporate \nfirm to a small business or even an individual household. Later, we will see that the firm’s value is deter­\nmined by its after-tax cash flow, which can differ significantly from the firm’s profits measured by its \naccounting income. As a result, we need to understand the differences between a firm’s cash flow and \nits accounting income—this discussion will come later. Fortunately, for the most part, a detailed knowl­\nedge of specific accounting differences for the different types of business organizations isn’t essential \nfor our purposes.

The NPV model solves for the net present value of an investment, \nthe present value difference between the cost of the investment V0 and future cash flows discounted \nby rate r/m plus the investment’s liquidation value Vn. \nThe internal rate of return (IRR) model. The IRR model finds the value of the discount rate r that", "label": 0}

The IRR model finds the value of the discount rate r that \nmakes NPV equal to zero. The variable r is unknown, and because it enters the equation with an expo­\nnent, r may have more than one solution. \nThe maximum bid (minimum sell) price model. The maximum bid price model finds the value of V0 \nsuch that NPV is zero. It represents the most an investor could pay for a future cash flow stream and \nstill break-even. The value of V0 that makes NPV zero may also represent the least-price an investor \ncould receive in exchange for the investment’s future cash flow stream and still break-even. \nThe annuity equivalent (AE) model. There are two versions of the annuity equivalent model. The first \none finds the value of a constant cash flow R received for mn periods whose NPV equals the present \nvalue sum of cash flows Ri(i = 1, …, mn) plus Smn, the equation’s NPV. \n(A.2)   \nIn the second version of the annuity equivalent model, we set NPV equal to zero and find the annuity \nequivalent whose discounted value is equal to V0.

In the first, the unknown variable \nis the term, mn, and its solution depends on the other known variables in the equation. In the sec­\nond term model, called the optimal term model, the solution for mn depends on a calculus-defined \ncondition requiring that we solve the model for various values of mn until the optimal conditions are \nsatisfied. This is a difficult model to solve because it requires that we know additional future values of \nvariables.

Some are \nwritten for students who may one day continue on in an economics PhD program. These texts develop advanced \ngeneral equilibrium models and use sophisticated mathematics. However, these texts are also very difficult for the \naverage, non-PhD-bound student to understand. Other intermediate texts are written for noneconomics majors who \nmay take only a few economics courses in their program. These texts present descriptive information about the world \nand only the bare basics about how economic models are used to describe that world. \nThis text strives to reach a median between these two approaches. First, I believe that students need to learn the \ntheory and models to understand how economists understand the world. I also think these ideas are accessible to", "label": 0}

I also think these ideas are accessible to \nmost students if they are explained thoroughly. This text presents numerous models in some detail, not by employing \nadvanced mathematics, but rather by walking students through a detailed description of how a model’s assumptions \ninfluence its conclusions. Second, and perhaps more important, students must learn how the models connect with the \nreal world. I believe that theory is done primarily to guide policy. We do positive economics to help answer the \nnormative questions; for example, what should a country do about its trade policy or its exchange rate policy? The \nresults from models give us insights that help us answer these questions. Thus this text strives to explain why each \nmodel is interesting by connecting its results to some aspect of a current policy issue. A prime example is found \nin Chapter 13 \"Fixed versus Floating Exchange Rates\" of this book, which addresses the age-old question of whether \ncountries use fixed or floating exchange rates. The chapter applies the theories developed throughout the text to assist \nour understanding of this long-standing debate. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3", "label": 0}

An economy is \nsomething that no one person can observe in its entirety. We are all a part of the economy, we all buy and sell things \ndaily, but we cannot observe all parts and aspects of an economy at any one time. \nFor this reason, economists build mathematical models, or theories, meant to describe different aspects of the real \nworld. For some students, economics seems to be all about these models and theories, these abstract equations and \ndiagrams. However, in actuality, economics is about the real world, the world we all live in. \nFor this reason, it is important in any economics course to describe the conditions in the real world before diving into \nthe theory intended to explain them. In this case, in a textbook about international finance, it is very useful for a \nstudent to know some of the values of important macroeconomic variables, the trends in these variables over time,", "label": 0}

It describes current economic \nconditions and past trends with respect to the most critical international macroeconomic indicators. In particular, it \ncompares the most recent worldwide economic recession with past business cycle activity to put our current situation \ninto perspective. The chapter also discusses important institutions and explains why they have been created. \nWith this overview about international finance in the real world in mind, a student can better understand why the \ntheories and models in the later chapters are being developed.

Learn the distinction between international trade and international finance. \nInternational economics is growing in importance as a field of study because of the rapid integration of \ninternational economic markets. Increasingly, businesses, consumers, and governments realize that their \nlives are affected not only by what goes on in their own town, state, or country but also by what is \nhappening around the world. Consumers can walk into their local shops today and buy goods and services \nfrom all over the world. Local businesses must compete with these foreign products. However, many of \nthese same businesses also have new opportunities to expand their markets by selling to a multitude of \nconsumers in other countries. The advance of telecommunications is also rapidly reducing the cost of \nproviding services internationally, while the Internet will assuredly change the nature of many products \nand services as it expands markets even further. \nOne simple way to see the rising importance of international economics is to look at the growth of exports", "label": 0}

Thus trade is not only rising rapidly in absolute \nterms; it is becoming relatively more important too. \nOne other indicator of world interconnectedness can be seen in changes in the amount of foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI). FDI is foreign ownership of productive activities and thus is another way in which \nforeign economic influence can affect a country.Figure 1.3 \"World Inward FDI Stocks, 1980–2007 \n(Percentage of World GDP)\" shows the stock, or the sum total value, of FDI around the world taken as a \npercentage of the world GDP between 1980 and 2007.

During each of these \nregular negotiations (eight of these rounds were completed between 1948 and 1994), countries promised \nto reduce their tariffs on imports in exchange for concessions—that means tariff reductions—by other \nGATT members. When the Uruguay Round, the most recently completed round, was finalized in 1994, the \nmember countries succeeded in extending the agreement to include liberalization promises in a much \nlarger sphere of influence.

This requires \ngovernments to maintain a balanced budget over time. Balance over time does not mean balance in every \nperiod but rather that periodic budget deficits should be offset with periodic budget surpluses. In this way, \ngovernment debt is managed and does not become excessive. It is also critical that governments do not \noverextend themselves in terms of international borrowing. International debt problems have become the \nbane of many countries. \nUnfortunately, most countries have been unable to accomplish this objective. Excessive government \ndeficits and borrowing are the norm for both developing and developed countries.

When excessive borrowing is coupled with an independent central \nbank and a floating exchange rate, exchange rate volatility is also common. \nStability of the international payments system then is less related to the type of exchange rate system \nchosen than it is to the internal policies of the individual countries. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies \nare the keys. \nWith prudent domestic policies in place, a floating exchange rate system will operate flawlessly. Fixed \nexchange systems are most appropriate when a country needs to force itself to a more prudent monetary \npolicy course. \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n• \nHistorically, no one system has operated flawlessly in all circumstances. \n• \nProbably the best reason to adopt a fixed exchange rate system is whenever a central bank has \nbeen independently unable to maintain prudent monetary policy, leading to a reasonably low \ninflation rate. \n• \nProbably the best reason to adopt a floating exchange rate system is whenever a country has", "label": 1}
