        "Finance refers to monetary resources and to the study and discipline of money, currency, assets\nand liabilities.[a] As a subject of study, it is related to but distinct from economics, which is the\nstudy of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.[b] Based on the\nscope of financial activities in financial systems, the discipline can be divided into personal,\ncorporate, and public finance.",
        "In these financial systems, assets are bought, sold, or traded as financial instruments, such as\ncurrencies, loans, bonds, shares, stocks, options, futures, etc. Assets can also be banked, invested,\nand insured to maximize value and minimize loss. In practice, risks are always present in any\nfinancial action and entities.",
        "Due to its wide scope, a broad range of subfields exists within finance. Asset-, money-, risk- and\ninvestment  management  aim  to  maximize  value  and  minimize  volatility.  Financial  analysis\nassesses  the  viability,  stability,  and  profitability  of  an  action  or  entity.  Some  fields  are\nmultidisciplinary,  such  as  mathematical  finance,  financial  law,  financial  economics,  financial\nengineering and financial technology. These fields are the foundation of business and accounting.",

Ancient and\nmedieval  civilizations  incorporated  basic  functions  of  finance,  such  as  banking,  trading  and\naccounting, into their economies. In the late 19th century, the global financial system was formed.",
        "In the middle of the 20th century, finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline,[c] separate\nfrom economics.[1] The earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the 1960s and\n1970s.[2] Today, finance is also widely studied through career-focused undergraduate and master's\nlevel programs.[3][4]",
        "As outlined, the financial system consists of the flows of capital that take place between individuals\nand  households  (personal  finance),  governments  (public  finance),  and  businesses  (corporate\nfinance). \"Finance\" thus studies the process of channeling money from savers and investors to\nentities that need it. [d] Savers and investors have money available which could earn interest or\ndividends if put to productive use. Individuals, companies and governments must obtain money\nfrom some external source, such as loans or credit, when they lack sufficient funds to run their\noperations.",

Although  quantum\ncomputational methods have been around for quite some time and use the basic principles of\nphysics to better understand the ways to implement and manage cash flows, it is mathematics that\nis  actually  important  in  this  new  scenario[42]  Finance  theory  is  heavily  based  on  financial\ninstrument  pricing  such  as  stock  option  pricing.  Many  of  the  problems  facing  the  finance\ncommunity have no known analytical solution. As a result, numerical methods and computer\nsimulations  for  solving  these  problems  have  proliferated.  This  research  area  is  known  as\ncomputational finance. Many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational\ncomplexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. In particular, when it\ncomes to option pricing, there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to\nquickly changing markets. For example, in order to take advantage of inaccurately priced stock\noptions,  the  computation  must  complete  before  the  next  change  in  the  almost  continuously\nchanging stock market. As a result, the finance community is always looking for ways to overcome\nthe resulting performance issues that arise when pricing options.

In these cultures, interest indicated a valuable increase, and seemed to\nconsider it from the lender's point of view.[43] The Code of Hammurabi (1792–1750 BCE) included\nlaws governing banking operations. The Babylonians were accustomed to charging interest at the",

        "After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve. \n3. Explain how politics and law are related. \n4. Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws. \n5. Understand some basic differences between the US legal system and other legal systems.",
        "Law has different meanings as well as different functions. Philosophers have considered issues of \njustice and law for centuries, and several different approaches, or schools of legal thought, have \nemerged. In this chapter, we will look at those different meanings and approaches and will consider \nhow social and political dynamics interact with the ideas that animate the various schools of legal \nthought. We will also look at typical sources of “positive law” in the United States and how some of \nthose sources have priority over others, and we will set out some basic differences between the US \nlegal system and other legal systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.1 What Is Law?",
        "Law is a word that means different things at different times. Black’s Law Dictionary says that law is “a \nbody of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force. That \nwhich must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1]",
        "In a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual \nrights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly \nsocial change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \nauthoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \nor political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism,",
        "European nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \nthose same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by",
        "Spain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation.",
        "In nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \ninternational community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet",
        "Union, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders.",
        "When Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly \nfor home turf rather than share power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups \nof families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be \nseen.",
        "In the United States, legislators, judges, administrative agencies, governors, and presidents make law, \nwith substantial input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle Association. In \nthe fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people. The process of electing \nstate judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign \ncontributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings.",
        "In the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other \nelected officials (the Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of",
        "Senate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes. Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years.",
        "In most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws. Revolutions are \ndifficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an \naspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law.",

        "Legal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command",
        "As legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or",
        "We could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most",
        "US highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\").",
        "Positivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”).",
        "Suppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee.",
        "The positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen",
        "The natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order.",

        "Philosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1]",

        "John Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view.",
        "Civil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,”",
        "Martin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2]",
        "Legal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define.",
        "It is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about",
        "Other Schools of Legal Thought",
        "The historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments.",
        "The legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context.",
        "The legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence.",
        "Some Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to \noverturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society.",
        "Related to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought. This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen.",
        "Each of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory).",

        "The law does not correct (or claim to correct) every wrong that occurs in society. At a minimum, it aims to \ncurb the worst kind of wrongs, the kinds of wrongs that violate what might be called the “moral \nminimums” that a community demands of its members. These include not only violations of criminal law \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\") but also torts (see Chapter 7 \"Introduction to Tort Law\") and broken \npromises (see Chapter 8 \"Contracts\"). Thus it may be wrong to refuse to return a phone call from a friend, \nbut that wrong will not result in a viable lawsuit against you. But if a phone (or the Internet) is used to \nlibel or slander someone, a tort has been committed, and the law may allow the defamed person to be \ncompensated.",
        "There is a strong association between what we generally think of as ethical behavior and what the laws \nrequire and provide. For example, contract law upholds society’s sense that promises—in general—should \nbe kept. Promise-breaking is seen as unethical. The law provides remedies for broken promises (in breach \nof contract cases) but not for all broken promises; some excuses are accepted when it would be reasonable \nto do so. For tort law, harming others is considered unethical. If people are not restrained by law from \nharming one another, orderly society would be undone, leading to anarchy. Tort law provides for \ncompensation when serious injuries or harms occur. As for property law issues, we generally believe that \nprivate ownership of property is socially useful and generally desirable, and it is generally protected (with \nsome exceptions) by laws. You can’t throw a party at my house without my permission, but my right to do \nwhatever I want on my own property may be limited by law; I can’t, without the public’s permission, \noperate an incinerator on my property and burn heavy metals, as toxic ash may be deposited throughout \nthe neighborhood.",

        "England, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision. They often \nresorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way. This is essentially reasoning by analogy. Thus the use of precedent in common-law cases \ncame into being, and a doctrine of stare decisis (pronounced STAR-ay-de-SIGH-sus) became accepted \nin English courts. Stare decisis means, in Latin, “let the decision stand.”",
        "Most judicial decisions that don’t apply legislative acts (known as statutes) will involve one of three areas \nof law—property, contract, or tort. Property law deals with the rights and duties of those who can legally \nown land (real property), how that ownership can be legally confirmed and protected, how property can \nbe bought and sold, what the rights of tenants (renters) are, and what the various kinds of “estates” in \nland are (e.g., fee simple, life estate, future interest, easements, or rights of way). Contract law deals with \nwhat kinds of promises courts should enforce. For example, should courts enforce a contract where one of \nthe parties was intoxicated, underage, or insane? Should courts enforce a contract where one of the \nparties seemed to have an unfair advantage? What kind of contracts would have to be in writing to be \nenforced by courts?

This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim",

If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation.

When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated.",
        "This standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation.",
        "But Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender,",
        "We therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious.",

But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while \npsychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is \nrequired.",

We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.”",

Many \nfeminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile-working-\nenvironment claims under Title VII more difficult to win. That did not happen. When the question to be \ndecided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case. Here, the question that the \ncourt poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological \ninjury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the \ncourt revisits a similar question and answers it differently.

There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation.

Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their",
        "The goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.)",
        "Another reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong.",
        "Finally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions.",
        "Why Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical?",
        "The usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable.",

Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses.

        "Financial markets can be divided into different subtypes:\n▪ Money market : It is traded with money or financial assets with short-term maturity and high\nliquidity, generally assets with a term of less than one year.\n▪ Capital market : Financial assets with medium and long-term maturity are traded, which are\nbasic for carrying out certain investment processes.\n▪ Organized market\n▪ Non-organized markets denominated in English (Over The Counter or OTC).\n▪ Primary market : Financial assets are created. In this market, assets are transmitted directly by\ntheir issuer.\n▪ Secondary market : Only existing financial assets are exchanged, which were issued at a\nprevious time. This market allows holders of financial assets to sell instruments that were\nalready issued in the primary market (or that had already been transmitted in the secondary\nmarket) and that are in their possession, or to buy other financial assets.",

In which alternative financial assets are traded such as portfolio\ninvestments, promissory notes, factoring, real estate (e.g. through fiduciary rights), in private\nequity funds, venture capital funds, hedge funds, investment projects (e.g. infrastructure,\ncinema, etc.) among many others.\n▪ Commodity markets, which allow the trading of commodities.\n▪ Derivatives markets, which provide instruments for managing financial risk.\n▪ Forward markets, which provide standardized forward contracts to trade products at a future\ndate.\n▪ Insurance markets, which allows the redistribution of varied risks.\n▪ Foreign exchange market, which allows the exchange of foreign currencies.",
        "While the stock market is the marketplace for buying and selling company stocks, the foreign\nexchange market, also known as forex or FX, is the global marketplace for the purchase and sale of\nnational  currencies.  It  serves  several  functions,  including  facilitating  currency  conversions,\nmanaging foreign exchange risk through futures and forwards, and providing a platform for\nspeculative investors to earn a profit on FX trading. The market includes various types of products,\nsuch as the spot market, futures market, forward market, swap market, and options market. For\nexample, the spot market involves the immediate buying and selling of currencies, while the\nforward market allows for the buying and selling of currencies at an agreed exchange rate, with the\nactual exchange taking place at a future delivery date. The foreign exchange market is needed for\nfacilitating global trade, including investments, the exchange of goods and services, and financial\ntransactions, and it is considered one of the largest markets in the global economy.[52][53]",

        "Many strategies can be classified as either fundamental analysis or technical analysis. Fundamental\nanalysis refers to analyzing companies by their financial statements found in SEC filings, business\ntrends, and general economic conditions. Technical analysis studies price actions in markets\nthrough the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on\nhistorical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical\nstrategy is the Trend following method, used by John W. Henry and Ed Seykota, which uses price\npatterns and is also rooted in risk management and diversification.",
