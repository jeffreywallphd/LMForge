With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \ninternational community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet \nUnion, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders. \nWhen Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly \nfor home turf rather than share power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups \nof families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be \nseen. \n \nLaw and Politics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n5 \nIn the United States, legislators, judges, administrative agencies, governors, and presidents make law, \nwith substantial input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle Association. In \nthe fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people. The process of electing \nstate judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign \ncontributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings. \n \nIn the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other \nelected officials (the Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of \nSenate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes. Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws. Revolutions are \ndifficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an \naspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLaw is the result of political action, and the political landscape is vastly different from nation to nation. \nUnstable or authoritarian governments often fail to serve the principal functions of law. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Explain why natural law relates to the rights that the founders of the US political-legal system found \nimportant. \n3. Describe legal positivism and explain how it differs from natural law. \n4. Differentiate critical legal studies and ecofeminist legal perspectives from both natural law and legal \npositivist perspectives. \n \n \nThere are different schools (or philosophies) concerning what law is all about. Philosophy of law is also \ncalled jurisprudence, and the two main schools are legal positivism and natural law.

This means that if a king, president, or dictator has power within a defined area or territory, then their laws are considered law. This theory is often used to justify the actions of authoritarian governments, as they can claim that their laws are legitimate because they have the power to enforce them. However, legal positivism can also be used to challenge the legitimacy of laws that are not backed by a recognized authority, such as those that are passed by unelected bodies or that are not enforced by the government. Ultimately, legal positivism is a way of thinking about the law that emphasizes the importance of authority and enforcement in determining what is and is not law."

Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought.

The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year.

Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwould override previous federal or state statutes. \n \nOne example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-\ndolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico. The Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments \nin 1988 spelled out certain protections for dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n25 \nbegan refusing to allow the importation of tuna that were caught using “dolphin-unfriendly” methods \n(such as purse seining). This was challenged at a GATT dispute panel in Switzerland, and the United \nStates lost. The discussion continued at the WTO under its dispute resolution process. In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective. That is, the United States may “unbind” itself \nwhenever it chooses. But for practical purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the \nnation. The argument goes something like this: if free trade in general helps the United States, then it \nmakes some sense to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite some temporary setbacks, \nthe WTO decision process will (it is hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run. This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process. Had Ross Perot \nbeen elected in 1992, for example, NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during his term \nof office. \n \nCauses of Action, Precedent, and Stare Decisis \nNo matter how wrong someone’s actions may seem to you, the only wrongs you can right in a court are \nthose that can be tied to one or more causes of action. Positive law is full of cases, treaties, statutes, \nregulations, and constitutional provisions that can be made into a cause of action. If you have an \nagreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-six trombones from you and he fails to pay for \nthem after you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will only act favorably on your \ncomplaint if you can show that his behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your state’s \ncontract law. This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n26 \nthat the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use \nto him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him. \n \nAn old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis \nnon curat lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action. If you are \nstood up for a Saturday night date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover anything in a \ncourt of law in the United States, as there is no cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can \nuse in your complaint. If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases.

How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A holding is the \ncourt’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the \nmeaning of the case as a precedent for future cases. \n \nBeyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to \nunderstand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought) \neach trial or appellate judge believes in.

The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French \ncourts may feel bound to reach the same result in future cases, under the doctrine of jurisprudence \nconstante.

Common-law \nsystems use juries, have one judge, and adhere to precedent. Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

Brady, 924 F.2d 872, 877–\n878 (CA9 1991) (rejecting such a requirement). \n \nII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n35 \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it “an unlawful employment practice for an \nemployer…to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, \nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct \nalleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with \ndiscrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group \nworkers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. \n957,32 L. Ed. 2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of \nharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable. \n \nWe therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity",

Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values.

Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law.

Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions about what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. 2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them. 3. Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding does not mean the same as saying a person or company is ethical."

(This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who",

Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct \nthan achieving the right results. A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society,",

Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do. \n \nThe importance of an individual’s having these consistent qualities of character is well known.

For example, Eliot \nSpitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good \nthey accomplished as public servants.

For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue \nbecomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the same lesson. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThroughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers \nhave come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social \ncontract theory; and virtue ethics. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nXYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles. Customers \nhave had near-death experiences from sudden acceleration; they would be driving along a highway at normal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n60 \nspeed when suddenly the car would begin to accelerate, and efforts to stop the acceleration by braking fail to \nwork. Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to \ndo so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration. \nInternal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are \nnot being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal. In fact, there appears to be a \npossible flaw in both models, perhaps in a semiconductor chip, that makes sudden acceleration happen. \nInterference by floor mats and poorly designed gas pedals do not seem to be the problem. \nIt is voluntary to report these incidents to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), \nbut the company decides that it will wait awhile and see if there are more complaints. Recalling the two \nmodels so that local dealers and their mechanics could examine them is also an option, but it would be \nextremely costly. Company executives are aware that quarterly and annual profit-and-loss statements, on \nwhich their bonuses depend, could be decisively worse with a recall. They decide that on a cost-benefit basis, \nit makes more sense to wait until there are more accidents and more data. After a hundred or more accidents \nand nearly fifteen fatalities, the company institutes a selective recall, still not notifying NHTSA, which has its \nown experts and the authority to order XYZ to do a full recall of all affected models. \nExperts have advised XYZ that standard failure-analysis methodology requires that the company obtain \nabsolutely every XYZ vehicle that has experienced sudden acceleration, using microscopic analysis of all critical \ncomponents of the electronic system. The company does not wish to take that advice, as it would be—as one \ntop executive put it—“too time-consuming and expensive.” \n1.

If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation. Or that he is to make \nexpenditures on reducing pollution beyond the amount that is in the best interests of the \ncorporation or that is required by law in order to contribute to the social objective of improving \nthe environment.

Insofar as his actions…reduce returns to stockholders, he is spending their \nmoney. Insofar as his actions raise the price to customers, he is spending the customers’ money. \nInsofar as his actions lower the wages of some employees, he is spending their money. \n \nThis process raises political questions on two levels: principle and consequences. On the level of \npolitical principle, the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of tax proceeds are governmental \nfunctions. We have established elaborate constitutional, parliamentary, and judicial provisions to \ncontrol these functions, to assure that taxes are imposed so far as possible in accordance with the \npreferences and desires of the public.… \n \n \nOthers have challenged the notion that corporate managers have no real duties except toward the owners \n(shareholders). By changing two letters in shareholder, stakeholder theorists widened the range of people \nand institutions that a corporation should pay moral consideration to. Thus they contend that a \ncorporation, through its management, has a set of responsibilities toward nonshareholder interests. \n \nStakeholder Theory \nStakeholders of a corporation include its employees, suppliers, customers, and the community. \nStakeholder is a deliberate play on the word shareholder, to emphasize that corporations have obligations \nthat extend beyond the bottom-line aim of maximizing profits. A stakeholder is anyone who most would \nagree is significantly affected (positively or negatively) by the decision of another moral agent. \n \nThere is one vital fact about corporations: the corporation is a creation of the law. Without law (and \ngovernment), corporations would not have existence. The key concept for corporations is the legal fact of \nlimited liability. The benefit of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant that larger pools of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n69 \ncapital could be aggregated for larger enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments should \nthe venture fail in any way, and there would be no personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal \nassets other than the value of the corporate stock. Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be",

Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and \nmodeled by the top of the organization. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n72 \n \nIt’s often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as top management is willing to make it. If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n73 \nIf you manage by the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers, based on the need to get \nstock price ever higher. At Enron, “15 percent a year or better earnings growth” was the mantra. Jeffrey \nPfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, observes how the belief that “stock \nprice is all that matters” has been hardwired into the corporate psyche. It dictates not only how people \njudge the worth of their company but also how they feel about themselves and the work that they are \ndoing. And, over time, it has clouded judgments about what is acceptable corporate behavior.

As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers.

At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year",

            "chunk": "at all costs. The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year \nperiod. New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n• \nThe long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to \nmeasure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially. \n• \nSears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant \ninformation about the service being offered. This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier. Sears, like other \nsellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would \nnot permit such information distortions. \n• \nPeople in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary. \n \nNoting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had \nlost sight of other goals for the organization. \n \nThe emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical. The \ntemptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write \nthe history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done. In a way, this \nfits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. \n \nConscious Capitalism \nOne effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious \ncapitalism movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7]",

Describe the various stages of a civil action: from pleadings, to discovery, to trial, and to appeals. \n5. Describe two alternatives to litigation: mediation and arbitration. \n \n \nIn the United States, law and government are interdependent. The Constitution establishes the basic \nframework of government and imposes certain limitations on the powers of government. In turn, the \nvarious branches of government are intimately involved in making, enforcing, and interpreting the \nlaw. Today, much of the law comes from Congress and the state legislatures. But it is in the courts \nthat legislation is interpreted and prior case law is interpreted and applied. \n \nAs we go through this chapter, consider the case of Harry and Kay Robinson. In which court should \nthe Robinsons file their action? Can the Oklahoma court hear the case and make a judgment that will \nbe enforceable against all of the defendants? Which law will the court use to come to a decision? Will \nit use New York law, Oklahoma law, federal law, or German law? \n \n \n \nRobinson v. Audi \nHarry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. (Seaway), in \nMassena, New York, in 1976. The following year the Robinson family, who resided in New York, left that \nstate for a new home in Arizona. As they passed through Oklahoma, another car struck their Audi in the \nrear, causing a fire that severely burned Kay Robinson and her two children. Later on, the Robinsons \nbrought a products-liability action in the District Court for Creek County, Oklahoma, claiming that their \ninjuries resulted from the defective design and placement of the Audi’s gas tank and fuel system. They \nsued numerous defendants, including the automobile’s manufacturer, Audi NSU Auto Union \nAktiengesellschaft (Audi); its importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen); its regional \ndistributor, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. (World-Wide); and its retail dealer, Seaway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n82 \n \nShould the Robinsons bring their action in state court or in federal court? Over which of the defendants \nwill the court have personal jurisdiction? \n \n \n \n \n3.1 The Relationship between State and Federal Court Systems \nin the United States \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the different but complementary roles of state and federal court systems. \n2. Explain why it makes sense for some courts to hear and decide only certain kinds of cases. \n3. Describe the difference between a trial court and an appellate court. \n \n \nAlthough it is sometimes said that there are two separate court systems, the reality is more complex. \nThere are, in fact, fifty-two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court system in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the federal court system. At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states. First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states. Thus a contract dispute resolved by an Arkansas court cannot be relitigated in North \nDakota when the plaintiff wants to collect on the Arkansas judgment in North Dakota.

Under \nthese circumstances, state judges will consult their own state’s case decisions involving conflicts of \nlaws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state’s laws to decide the case (see Table 3.1 \n\"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). \n \nAs state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal courts are often concerned with state law \nand with what happens in state courts. Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts. The Constitution \nestablished diversity jurisdiction because it was feared that local courts would be hostile toward \npeople from other states and that they would need separate courts. In 2009, nearly a third of all \nlawsuits filed in federal court were based on diversity of citizenship. In these cases, the federal courts \nwere applying state law, rather than taking federal question jurisdiction, where federal law \nprovided the basis for the lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or defendant). \n \nWhy are there so many diversity cases in federal courts? Defense lawyers believe that there is \nsometimes a “home-court advantage” for an in-state plaintiff who brings a lawsuit against a \nnonresident in his local state court. The defense attorney is entitled to ask for removal to a federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n84 \ncourt where there is diversity. This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial function \nhas original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to \nthem. A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in",

Explain the concept of subject matter jurisdiction and distinguish it from personal jurisdiction. \n2. Understand how and where the US Constitution provides a set of instructions as to what federal courts are \nempowered by law to do. \n3. Know which kinds of cases must be heard in federal courts only. \n4. Explain diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and be able to decide whether a case is eligible for diversity \njurisdiction in the federal courts. \n \n \nJurisdiction is an essential concept in understanding courts and the legal system. Jurisdiction is a \ncombination of two Latin words: juris (law) and diction(to speak). Which court has the power “to \nspeak the law” is the basic question of jurisdiction. \n \nThere are two questions about jurisdiction in each case that must be answered before a judge will \nhear a case: the question of subject matter jurisdiction and the question of personal jurisdiction. \nWe will consider the question of subject matter jurisdiction first, because judges do; if they \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n90 \ndetermine, on the basis of the initial documents in the case (the “pleadings”), that they have no \npower to hear and decide that kind of case, they will dismiss it. \n \nThe Federal-State Balance: Federalism \nState courts have their origins in colonial era courts. After the American Revolution, state courts \nfunctioned (with some differences) much like they did in colonial times. The big difference after 1789 was \nthat state courts coexisted with federal courts. Federalism was the system devised by the nation’s \nfounders in which power is shared between states and the federal government. This sharing requires a \ndivision of labor between the states and the federal government. It is Article III of the US Constitution \nthat spells out the respective spheres of authority (jurisdiction) between state and federal courts. \n \nTake a close look at Article III of the Constitution. (You can find a printable copy of the Constitution \nat http://www.findlaw.com.) Article III makes clear that federal courts are courts of limited power or \njurisdiction. Notice that the only kinds of cases federal courts are authorized to deal with have strong \nfederal connections. For example, federal courts have jurisdiction when a federal law is being used by the \nplaintiff or prosecutor (a “federal question” case) or the case arises “in admiralty” (meaning that the \nproblem arose not on land but on sea, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any state, or in navigable \nwaters within the United States). Implied in this list is the clear notion that states would continue to have \ntheir own laws, interpreted by their own courts, and that federal courts were needed only where the issues \nraised by the parties had a clear federal connection. The exception to this is diversity jurisdiction, \ndiscussed later. \n \nThe Constitution was constructed with the idea that state courts would continue to deal with basic kinds \nof claims such as tort, contract, or property claims. Since states sanction marriages and divorce, state \ncourts would deal with “domestic” (family) issues. Since states deal with birth and death records, it stands \nto reason that paternity suits, probate disputes, and the like usually wind up in state courts. You wouldn’t \ngo to the federal building or courthouse to get a marriage license, ask for a divorce, or probate a will: these \nmatters have traditionally been dealt with by the states (and the thirteen original colonies before them). \nMatters that historically get raised and settled in state court under state law include not only domestic and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n91 \nprobate matters but also law relating to corporations, partnerships, agency, contracts, property, torts, and \ncommercial dealings generally. You cannot get married or divorced in federal court, because federal \ncourts have no jurisdiction over matters that are historically (and are still) exclusively within the domain \nof state law. \n \nIn terms of subject matter jurisdiction, then, state courts will typically deal with the kinds of disputes just \ncited. Thus if you are Michigan resident and have an auto accident in Toledo with an Ohio resident and \nyou each blame each other for the accident, the state courts would ordinarily resolve the matter if the \ndispute cannot otherwise be settled.

These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail. Cases can be decided \non the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the \ncourt can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks. (2) The defendant can move to \ndismiss the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to “state a claim on which relief can be \ngranted,” or on the basis that there is no subject matter jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, \nor on the basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is saying, in effect, \nthat even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by \nthe court. For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-\ncalled alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will \ndismiss the complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a \ndemurrer.) \n \nA third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment. If there is no triable \nquestion of fact or law, there is no reason to have a trial. For example, the plaintiff sues on a promissory \nnote and, at deposition (an oral examination under oath), the defendant admits having made no payment \non the note and offers no excuse that would be recognizable as a reason not to pay. There is no reason to \nhave a trial, and the court should grant summary judgment. \n \nDiscovery \nIf there is a factual dispute, the case will usually involve some degree of discovery, where each party tries \nto get as much information out of the other party as the rules allow. Until the 1940s, when discovery \nbecame part of civil procedure rules, a lawsuit was frequently a game in which each party hid as much \ninformation as possible and tried to surprise the other party in court. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n109 \nBeginning with a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in 1938 \nand subsequently followed by many of the states, the parties are entitled to learn the facts of the case \nbefore trial. The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a",

For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years. Depositions can consume days or even weeks of an executive’s time. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nMany cases never get to trial. They are disposed of by motions to dismiss or are settled after extensive \ndiscovery makes clear to the parties the strengths and weaknesses of the parties to the dispute. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n110 \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Under contributory negligence, the negligence of any plaintiff that causes or contributes to the injuries a \nplaintiff complains of will be grounds for dismissal. Suppose that in discovery, Mr. Ferlito in Ferlito v. \nJohnson & Johnson (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") admits that he brought the cigarette lighter dangerously close to \nhis costume, saying, “Yes, you could definitely say I was being careless; I had a few drinks under my belt.” \nAlso, Mrs. Ferlito admits that she never reads product instructions from manufacturers. If the case is \nbrought in a state where contributory negligence is the law, on what basis can Johnson & Johnson have the \ncase dismissed before trial? \n \n \n \n \n3.4 The Pretrial and Trial Phase \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how judges can push parties into pretrial settlement. \n2. Explain the meaning and use of directed verdicts. \n3. Distinguish a directed verdict from a judgment n.o.v. (“notwithstanding the verdict”). \n \n \nAfter considerable discovery, one of the parties may believe that there is no triable issue of law or fact \nfor the court to consider and may file a motion with the court for summary judgment. Unless it is \nvery clear, the judge will deny a summary judgment motion, because that ends the case at the trial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n111 \nlevel; it is a “final order” in the case that tells the plaintiff “no” and leaves no room to bring another \nlawsuit against the defendant for that particular set of facts (res judicata). If the plaintiff successfully \nappeals a summary judgment motion, the case will come back to the trial court. \n \nPrior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in an effort to investigate the possibilities of \nsettlement. Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the \nattorneys. The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

For \nexample, in the Robinsons’ case against Audi, the attorneys representing Audi will want to know if any \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n112 \nprospective jurors have ever owned an Audi, what their experience has been, and if they had a similar \nproblem (or worse) with their Audi that was not resolved to their satisfaction. If so, the defense attorney \ncould well believe that such a juror has a potential for a bias against her client. In that case, she could use \na challenge for cause, explaining to the judge the basis for her challenge. The judge, at her discretion, \ncould either accept the for-cause reason or reject it. \n \nEven if an attorney cannot articulate a for-cause reason acceptable to the judge, he may use one of several \nperemptory challenges that most states (and the federal system) allow. A trial attorney with many years of \nexperience may have a sixth sense about a potential juror and, in consultation with the client, may decide \nto use a peremptory challenge to avoid having that juror on the panel. \n \nAfter the jury is sworn and seated, the plaintiff’s lawyer makes an opening statement, laying out the \nnature of the plaintiff’s claim, the facts of the case as the plaintiff sees them, and the evidence that the \nlawyer will present. The defendant’s lawyer may also make an opening statement or may reserve his right \nto do so at the end of the plaintiff’s case. \n \nThe plaintiff’s lawyer then calls witnesses and presents the physical evidence that is relevant to her proof. \nThe direct testimony at trial is usually far from a smooth narration. The rules of evidence (that govern the \nkinds of testimony and documents that may be introduced at trial) and the question-and-answer format \ntend to make the presentation of evidence choppy and difficult to follow. \n \nAnyone who has watched an actual televised trial or a television melodrama featuring a trial scene will \nappreciate the nature of the trial itself: witnesses are asked questions about a number of issues that may \nor may not be related, the opposing lawyer will frequently object to the question or the form in which it is \nasked, and the jury may be sent from the room while the lawyers argue at the bench before the judge. \n \nAfter direct testimony of each witness is over, the opposing lawyer may conduct cross-examination. This \nis a crucial constitutional right; in criminal cases it is preserved in the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment \n(the right to confront one’s accusers in open court). The formal rules of direct testimony are then relaxed, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n113 \nand the cross-examiner may probe the witness more informally, asking questions that may not seem \nimmediately relevant. This is when the opposing attorney may become harsh, casting doubt on a witness’s \ncredibility, trying to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or not to be trusted. This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence. A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant. Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial.",

In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue? Time—and \nthe Supreme Court—will tell. \n \nClass Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n122 \nMost lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other \norganization. But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave. If she does, she will not be \nincluded in an eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n123 \ncannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the \noutcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAnyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has \nstanding will be heard by the courts. Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to \nensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries. Class actions are \na way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1.

Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” \nThe general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in \naccord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their \nown views and values. Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the \nConstitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics \nof the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as \nthe right of states to be free from federal antidiscrimination laws. See, for example, Kimel v. Florida \nBoard of Regents, or the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case (Section 4.6.5), which held \nthat corporations are “persons” with “free speech rights” that include spending unlimited amounts of \nmoney in campaign donations and political advocacy. [3] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n144 \nBecause Roe v. Wade has been so controversial, this chapter includes a seminal case on “the right of \nprivacy,” Griswold v. Connecticut, Section 4.6.1. Was the court was correct in recognizing a “right of \nprivacy” in Griswold? This may not seem like a “business case,” but consider: the manufacture and \ndistribution of birth control devices is a highly profitable (and legal) business in every US state. Moreover, \nGriswold illustrates another important and much-debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive \ndue process (see Section 4.5.3 \"Fifth Amendment\"). The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is \nbrought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business \nafter Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited \nrather than overruled Roe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, \nand efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In \ndeciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the \nSupreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the \nConstitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its \ninterpretation. Only a constitutional amendment or the court’s repudiation of Roe v. Wade as a precedent \ncould change that interpretation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n145 \nThe Constitution gives voice to the idea that people have basic rights and that a civilian president is also the \ncommander in chief of the armed forces.

Name the specific clause through which Congress has the power to regulate commerce. What, specifically, \ndoes this clause say? \n2. Explain how early decisions of the Supreme Court interpreted the scope of the commerce clause and how \nthat impacted the legislative proposals and programs of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great \nDepression. \n3. Describe both the wider use of the commerce clause from World War II through the 1990s and the \nlimitations the Supreme Court imposed in Lopez and other cases. \n \n \nFirst, turn to Article I, Section 8. The commerce clause gives Congress the exclusive power to make \nlaws relating to foreign trade and commerce and to commerce among the various states. Most of the \nfederally created legal environment springs from this one clause: if Congress is not authorized in the \nConstitution to make certain laws, then it acts unconstitutionally and its actions may be ruled \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Lately, the Supreme Court has not been shy about ruling acts of \nCongress unconstitutional. \n \nHere are the first five parts of Article I, Section 8, which sets forth the powers of the federal legislature. \nThe commerce clause is in boldface. It is short, but most federal legislation affecting business depends on \nthis very clause: \n \nSection 8 \n[Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; \nbut all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; \n[Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \n \n[Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes; \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n147 \n[Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of \nBankruptcies throughout the United States; \n \n[Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of \nWeights and Measures; \n \nEarly Commerce Clause Cases \nFor many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying the commerce clause: Congress could only \nuse it to legislate aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another. Anything else was deemed \nlocal rather than national. For example, In Hammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916 federal statute \nhad barred transportation in interstate commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing \nchildren under fourteen or employing children fourteen and above for more than eight hours a day. A \ncomplaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his \nown behalf and on behalf of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other \nbetween fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nThe father’s lawsuit asked the court to enjoin (block) the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to \nprevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor. \n \nThe Supreme Court saw the issue as whether Congress had the power under the commerce clause to \ncontrol interstate shipment of goods made by children under the age of fourteen. The court found that \nCongress did not. The court cited several cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be \nconstitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of",

Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was \nchallenged on the ground that Congress lacked the power under the commerce clause to regulate what \nwas otherwise fairly local conduct. For example, Title II of the act prohibited racial discrimination in \npublic accommodations (such as hotels, motels, and restaurants), leading to the famous case \nof Katzenbach v. McClung(1964). \n \nOllie McClung’s barbeque place in Birmingham, Alabama, allowed “colored” people to buy takeout at the \nback of the restaurant but not to sit down with “white” folks inside. The US attorney sought a court order \nto require Ollie to serve all races and colors, but Ollie resisted on commerce clause grounds: the federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n150 \ngovernment had no business regulating a purely local establishment. Indeed, Ollie did not advertise \nnationally, or even regionally, and had customers only from the local area. But the court found that some \n42 percent of the supplies for Ollie’s restaurant had moved in the channels of interstate commerce. This \nwas enough to sustain federal regulation based on the commerce clause. [3] \n \nFor nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that Congress could almost always find some \ninterstate commerce connection for any law it might pass. It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 \nwhen the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that \nprohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The law was part of a twenty-year trend \n(roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime. Lopez’s \nlawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged \nthe law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this \nlegislation. The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the \nSupreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because \neducation of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near \nschool yards detracted from students’ education. The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the \ngovernment’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything. \nLopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court. \n \nCongress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided. But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair \ninterstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy \nBrzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players \nat Virginia Tech, had raped her. In 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against Morrison and Crawford \nunder Virginia Tech’s sexual assault policy. After a hearing, Morrison was found guilty of sexual assault \nand sentenced to immediate suspension for two semesters. Crawford was not punished. A second hearing \nagain found Morrison guilty. After an appeal through the university’s administrative system, Morrison’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n151 \npunishment was set aside, as it was found to be “excessive.” Ultimately, Brzonkala dropped out of the \nuniversity. Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging \nthat Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides \na federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional. In \ndismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section \n13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly \nidentified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA.

Understand the role of the supremacy clause in the balance between state and federal power. \n2. Give examples of cases where state legislation is preempted by federal law and cases where state \nlegislation is not preempted by federal law. \n \n \nWhen Congress does use its power under the commerce clause, it can expressly state that it wishes to have \nexclusive regulatory authority. For example, when Congress determined in the 1950s to promote nuclear \npower (“atoms for peace”), it set up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and provided a limitation of \nliability for nuclear power plants in case of a nuclear accident. The states were expressly told to stay out of \nthe business of regulating nuclear power or the movement of nuclear materials. Thus Rochester, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n159 \nMinnesota, or Berkeley, California, could declare itself a nuclear-free zone, but the federal government \nwould have preempted such legislation. If Michigan wished to set safety standards at Detroit Edison’s \nFermi II nuclear reactor that were more stringent than the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s \nstandards, Michigan’s standards would be preempted and thus be void. \n \nEven where Congress does not expressly preempt state action, such action may be impliedly pre-empted. \nStates cannot constitutionally pass laws that interfere with the accomplishment of the purposes of the \nfederal law. Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that sets standards for \nforeign vessels to enter the navigable waters and ports of the United States. If a state creates a law that \nsets standards that conflict with the federal law or sets standards so burdensome that they interfere with \nfederal law, the doctrine of preemption will (in accordance with the supremacy clause) void the state \nlaw or whatever parts of it are inconsistent with federal law.",

Your \nemployer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example, if drug testing of all \nemployees every week is done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of action to object \nbased on the Fourth Amendment. However, if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug \ntesting, employees have no constitutional arguments to make; they can simply leave that employer, or \nthey may pursue whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n167 \nFifth Amendment \nThe Fifth Amendment states, “No person shall be…deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” \n \nThe Fifth Amendment has three principal aspects: procedural due process, the takings clause, \nand substantive due process. In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents \ngovernment from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also \nconstitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair. This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger \nKing v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, \nbut the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely \ncontract with one another. Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down \nthat aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions. \nHowever, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of \nlaws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties.

Connecticut \n381 U.S. 479 (U.S. Supreme Court 1965) \n \nA nineteenth-century Connecticut law made the use, possession, or distribution of birth control devices \nillegal. The law also prohibited anyone from giving information about such devices. The executive \ndirector and medical director of a planned parenthood association were found guilty of giving out such \ninformation to a married couple that wished to delay having children for a few years. The directors \nwere fined $100 each. \n \nThey appealed throughout the Connecticut state court system, arguing that the state law violated \n(infringed) a basic or fundamental right of privacy of a married couple: to live together and have sex \ntogether without the restraining power of the state to tell them they may legally have intercourse but \nnot if they use condoms or other birth control devices. At each level (trial court, court of appeals, and \nConnecticut Supreme Court), the Connecticut courts upheld the constitutionality of the convictions. \n \nPlurality Opinion by Justice William O. Douglass \n \nWe do not sit as a super legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch \neconomic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. The [Connecticut] law, however, operates \ndirectly on intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician’s role in one aspect of that relation. \n \n[Previous] cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by \nemanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.…Various guarantees create \nzones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one.…The \nThird Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers “in any house” in time of peace \nwithout the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy.  \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n175 \nThe Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \npapers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Fifth Amendment in its Self-\nIncrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which the government may not force \nhim to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: “The enumeration in the \nConstitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” \n \nThe Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described…as protection against all governmental invasions “of \nthe sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life.” We recently referred in Mapp v. Ohio…to the \nFourth Amendment as creating a “right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and \nparticularly reserved to the people.” \n \n[The law in question here], in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their \nmanufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by having a maximum destructive impact on [the marital] \nrelationship. Such a law cannot stand.…Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of \nmarital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of \nprivacy surrounding the marital relationship. \n \nWe deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than \nour school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate \nto the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in \nliving, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for \nas noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. \n \nMr. Justice Stewart, whom Mr. Justice Black joins, dissenting. \n \nSince 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I \nthink this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in \nthe oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the \nrelationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual’s moral, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n176 \nethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of \nbirth control should be available to all, so that each individual’s choice can be meaningfully made. But we \nare not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold \nthat it violates the United States Constitution. And that I cannot do. \n \nIn the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, \nthe Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. But the Court does not say which of these \nAmendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law. \n \n…",

Prior to the statute’s enactment,…apples from 13 different States were shipped into North \nCarolina for sale. Seven of those States, including [Washington], had their own grading systems which, \nwhile differing in their standards, used similar descriptive labels (e.g., fancy, extra fancy, etc.). This \nmultiplicity of inconsistent state grades [posed] dangers of deception and confusion not only in the North \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n188 \nCarolina market, but in the Nation as a whole. The North Carolina statute, appellants claim, was enacted \nto eliminate this source of deception and confusion. [Moreover], it is contended that North Carolina \nsought to accomplish this goal of uniformity in an evenhanded manner as evidenced by the fact that its \nstatute applies to all apples sold in closed containers in the State without regard to their point of origin. \n[As] the appellants properly point out, not every exercise of state authority imposing some burden on the \nfree flow of commerce is invalid, [especially] when the State acts to protect its citizenry in matters \npertaining to the sale of foodstuffs. By the same token, however, a finding that state legislation furthers \nmatters of legitimate local concern, even in the health and consumer protection areas, does not end the \ninquiry. Rather, when such state legislation comes into conflict with the Commerce Clause’s overriding \nrequirement of a national “common market,” we are confronted with the task of effecting an \naccommodation of the competing national and local interests. We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The \nrecord demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the \napple trade. [The record] contains numerous affidavits [stating a] preference [for] apples graded under \nthe Washington, as opposed to the USDA, system because of the former’s greater consistency, its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n189 \nemphasis on color, and its supporting mandatory inspections. Once again, the statute had no similar \nimpact on the North Carolina apple industry and thus operated to its benefit. \n \nThird, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, \nthe statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers. \n[With] free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage \nvis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior. However, because of \nthe statute’s operation, Washington apples which would otherwise qualify for and be sold under the \nsuperior Washington grades will now have to be marketed under their inferior USDA counterparts. Such \n“downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-\nof-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit. At worst, it will have the effect of an \nembargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them \nfrom the North Carolina market. At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that \nsuch apples would otherwise command. \n \nDespite the statute’s facial neutrality, the Commission suggests that its discriminatory impact on \ninterstate commerce was not an unintended by-product, and there are some indications in the record to",

The statute raised the costs of doing business in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of their North Carolina counterparts unaffected. The increased costs imposed by the statute tended to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington apple growers and dealers who were already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance from the North Carolina market. The statute also had the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive and economic advantages it had earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The statute prohibited Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State's grades, which had a leveling effect that operated to the advantage of local apple producers."

It noted that “the \nSupreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though \nthe speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.” Id. at 281. \n \nII \n[Omitted: the court considers whether it is possible to reject the BCRA without declaring certain \nprovisions unconstitutional. The court concludes it cannot find a basis to reject the BCRA that does not \ninvolve constitutional issues.] \n \n \nIII \nThe First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech.” \nLaws enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at different points in the speech process.…The \nlaw before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all \ncorporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or \ndefeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election \nand 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n194 \nClub runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to \ndisapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association \npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports \na handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a \nPresidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic \nexamples of censorship. \n \nSection 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation \ncan still speak. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to \nextensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the \ntreasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve \nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within \n10 days. \n \nAnd that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at \ndifferent times depending on the type of election that is about to occur.… \n \nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the \nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs. PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. \nGiven the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views \nknown regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign. \nSection 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \n“restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a \ncampaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues \ndiscussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1 at 19 (1976).… \n \nSpeech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the \npeople. See Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n195 \ncitizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.”) The right of citizens to \ninquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-\ngovernment and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent \napplication’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” \n \nFor these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or \ninadvertence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the \nGovernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” \n \n… \n \nThe Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784. The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of \ncorporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply \nbecause such associations are not “natural persons.” \n \nThe purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations,",

For example, there is a need to regulate \nfrequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, \nnational defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something \nthat must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods \nsuch as education, a highway system, lighthouses, a military for defense. \n \nTrue laissez-faire capitalism—a market free from any regulation—would not try to deal with market \nimperfections and would also allow people to freely choose products, services, and other arrangements \nthat historically have been deemed socially unacceptable. These would include making enforceable \ncontracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or \ncrack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage \npartnership. \n \nThus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by \nwhat is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the \nsocial arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or \nunsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers \nfrom unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can \nbe used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment \ndiscrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and \nmonitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental \nProtection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company). \n \nHistory of Federal Agencies \nThrough the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between \nthe states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that \nindependent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may \ndirectly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may \noversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by \nCongress). \n \nPowers of Agencies \nAgencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal \nCommunications Act, gave them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive activity covered \nby the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power \nplant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, the move toward \nderegulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power. Many agencies also have the \nauthority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies \ncan regulate business practices. The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce \nto monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of \nthe stock exchanges. \n \nUnlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific \nassignment or reaching a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the \nday; they must act. They have been given legislative powers because in a society growing ever more \ncomplex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it \nhave the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely because they are to do what \ngeneral legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of experience in \ndealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish \ntheir statutory duties. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n211 \nAll administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel. The heads, whether a single \nadministrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively \nlimited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making \noccurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting \ndata and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies. \n \nThe Constitution and Agencies \nCongress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of \ngovernmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. \nThe most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision. The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency \nactions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 \"Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review\" on \n“Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAdministrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate.

Understand why the Administrative Procedure Act was needed. \n2. Understand how hearings are conducted under the act. \n3. Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer. The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more \naccurately reflect their duties. Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free \nof assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the \nagency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function. \nThe accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, \nto cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers.

For example, after the \nReagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies \nchallenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that \nthe agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record \nand the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies \nthus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased \npassenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured. [1] \n \nSuing the Government \nIn the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative \nagencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly \nlegitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their \nbounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have? \n \nMainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private \nindividuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n226 \nsovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route. [2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year.",

In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set \nin the United States through the Constitution’s prohibition on “cruel or unusual punishments.” \n \nIt is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. But there are far too many criminal laws for \nanyone to know them all. Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of \n“criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving \nwithout a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society. You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws. Teenagers hanging around \nthe sidewalks on Main Street were sometimes arrested for “loitering.” The constitutional void-for-\nvagueness doctrine has led the courts to overturn statutes that are not clear. For example, “vagrancy” \nwas long held to be a crime, but US courts began some forty years ago to overturn vagrancy and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n243 \n“suspicious person” statutes on the grounds that they are too vague for people to know what they are \nbeing asked not to do. \nThis requirement that criminal statutes not be vague does not mean that the law always defines \ncrimes in ways that can be easily and clearly understood. Many statutes use terminology developed \nby the common-law courts. For example, a California statute defines murder as “the unlawful killing \nof a human being, with malice aforethought.” If no history backed up these words, they would be \nunconstitutionally vague. But there is a rich history of judicial decisions that provides meaning for \nmuch of the arcane language like “malice aforethought” strewn about in the statute books. \n \nBecause a crime is an act that the legislature has defined as socially harmful, the parties involved \ncannot agree among themselves to forget a particular incident, such as a barroom brawl, if the \nauthorities decide to prosecute. This is one of the critical distinctions between criminal and civil law. \nAn assault is both a crime and a tort. The person who was assaulted may choose to forgive his \nassailant and not to sue him for damages. But he cannot stop the prosecutor from bringing an \nindictment against the assailant. (However, because of crowded dockets, a victim that declines to \npress charges may cause a busy prosecutor to choose to not to bring an indictment.) \n \nA crime consists of an act defined as criminal—an actus reus—and the requisite “criminal intent.” \nSomeone who has a burning desire to kill a rival in business or romance and who may actually intend \nto murder but does not act on his desire has not committed a crime. He may have a “guilty mind”—\nthe translation of the Latin phrase mens rea—but he is guilty of no crime. A person who is forced to \ncommit a crime at gunpoint is not guilty of a crime, because although there was an act defined as \ncriminal—an actus reus—there was no criminal intent. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCrimes are usually defined by statute and constitute an offense against society. In each case, there must be \nboth an act and some mens rea (criminal intent). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n244 \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

            "chunk": "Statutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car. If the finance company repossesses the car, the \ncustomer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have \ntaken the new car by larceny or embezzlement. Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the \ndealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal. \nIn most states, this is specifically defined in the statutes as theft of services. \n \nReceiving Stolen Property \nOne who engages in receiving stolen property with knowledge that it is stolen is guilty of a felony or \nmisdemeanor, depending on the value of the property. The receipt need not be personal; if the property is \ndelivered to a place under the control of the receiver, then he is deemed to have received it. “Knowledge” \nis construed broadly: not merely actual knowledge, but (correct) belief and suspicion (strong enough not \nto investigate for fear that the property will turn out to have been stolen) are sufficient for conviction. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n249 \n \nForgery \nForgery is false writing of a document of legal significance (or apparent legal significance!) with intent to \ndefraud. It includes the making up of a false document or the alteration of an existing one. The writing \nneed not be done by hand but can be by any means—typing, printing, and so forth. Documents commonly \nthe subject of forgery are negotiable instruments (checks, money orders, and the like), deeds, receipts, \ncontracts, and bills of lading. The forged instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood. If \nyou fake your neighbor’s signature on one of his checks made out to cash, you have committed forgery. \nBut if you sign a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that there is no money in your \nchecking account, the instrument is not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the intent to \ndefraud. \n \nThe mere making of a forged instrument is unlawful. So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an \ninstrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false signature is \nby no means the only way to commit forgery. If done with intent to defraud, the backdating of a \ndocument, the modification of a corporate name, or the filling in of lines left blank on a form can all \nconstitute forgery. \n \nExtortion \nUnder common law, extortion could only be committed by a government official, who corruptly \ncollected an unlawful fee under color of office. A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery).

It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of \nanother in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who \nsneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out \nthe act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room \nfor argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a \nclosed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? \nWhose dwelling? Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person burglarize his \nown home? (No.) \n \nArson \nUnder common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one’s own \nhouse for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law. The statutes today \nmake it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not \nthe purpose is to collect insurance. \nBribery \nBribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in \ncash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find valuable. Under \ncommon law, only a public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges can result from the \nbribe of anyone performing a public function. \n \nBribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. \nBribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. \n \nPerjury \nPerjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official \nproceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”). To be \nperjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without \nsincere belief that it was true. An innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is perjury if \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n251 \nthe maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my \nknowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury. To support a \ncharge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant \nto whatever the court is trying to find out. \n \nWhite-Collar Crime \nWhite-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried \nout in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, \nbut embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory \ndefinitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law. Depending on how they \nare carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law. \n \nAny act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls \nor Internet connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many different acts around the buying and \nselling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws. Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who",

For example, \nin a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a \nuse that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water \nAct, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from \n$2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are \nspecifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include \nofficers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused \nthe discharge. [2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation. The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 \"Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"). \nCongress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where \ncomputers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature. \n \nTable 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nObtaining national security information \nSec.

Understand how it is possible to commit a criminal act without actually doing anything that you think might \nbe criminal. \n2. Analyze and explain the importance of intention in criminal law and criminal prosecutions. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n255 \n3. Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the \ncrime. \n \n \nTo be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient. But what \nconstitutes an act? This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead? The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison). States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense.

The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis. In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of \nwhom is appointed for every federal district. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n263 \nFollowing the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document \nstating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury for \nan indictment. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence. The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment. The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff \nwill have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n264 \nFollowing a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will impose a sentence after presentencing \nreports are written by various court officials (often, probation officers). Permissible sentences are \nspelled out in statutes, though these frequently give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., \ntwenty years to life). The judge may sentence the defendant to imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may \ndecide to suspend sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence as long as he stays \nout of trouble). \n \nSentencing usually comes before appeal. As in civil cases, the defendant, now convicted, has the right \nto take at least one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and constitutional rights may \nbe argued. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCriminal procedure in US courts is designed to provide a fair process to both criminal defendants and to \nsociety. The grand jury system, prosecutorial discretion, plea bargains, and appeals for lack of a fair trial are all \npart of US criminal procedure. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Harold is charged with the crime of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill or inflict serious bodily \ninjury. It is a more serious crime than simple assault.

Mills \n96 Ariz. 377, 396 P.2d 5 (Ariz. 1964) \n \nLOCKWOOD, VICE CHIEF JUSTICE \n \nDefendants appeal from a conviction on two counts of obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of \nAR.S. §§ 13-661.A3. and 13-663.A1. The material facts, viewed “…in the light most favorable to sustaining \nthe conviction,” are as follows: Defendant William Mills was a builder and owned approximately 150 \nhomes in Tucson in December, 1960. Mills conducted his business in his home. In 1960 defendant \nWinifred Mills, his wife, participated in the business generally by answering the telephone, typing, and \nreceiving clients who came to the office. \n \nIn December 1960, Mills showed the complainant, Nathan Pivowar, a house at 1155 Knox Drive and \nanother at 1210 Easy Street, and asked Pivowar if he would loan money on the Knox Drive house. Pivowar \ndid not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction. Later in the same month \nNathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan $5,000 and $4,000 \non the two houses. Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes \nagain. \n \nMills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar. Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office \nMrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation. After the mortgages had been recorded on \nDecember 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for $5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage \nformerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of $3,000. In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two \npersonal notes in the sums of $5,250.00 and $4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan. \n \nAlthough the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did \nnot present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them. In 1962 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n270 \nthe complainant learned that the mortgages which he had taken as security in the transaction were not \nfirst mortgages on the Knox Drive and Easy Street properties. These mortgages actually covered two \nvacant lots on which there were outstanding senior mortgages. On learning this, Pivowar signed a \ncomplaint charging the defendants with the crime of theft by false pretenses. \n \nOn appeal defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the \ninformation. They urge that a permanent taking of property must be proved in order to establish the \ncrime of theft. Since the complainant had the right to sue on the defendants’ notes, the defendants assert \nthat complainant cannot be said to have been deprived of his property permanently. Defendants \nmisconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses. Stated in a different form, their \nargument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second \nmortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan. \n \nDefendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction. \nRespectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit. A creditor has a \nright to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor. In the former \ncase, he has a right to know about the security. If he extends credit in reliance upon security which is \nfalsely represented to be adequate, he has been defrauded even if the debtor intends to repay the debt. His \nposition is now that of an unsecured creditor. At the very least, an unreasonable risk of loss has been \nforced upon him by reason of the deceit. This risk which he did not intend to assume has been imposed \nupon him by the intentional act of the debtor, and such action constitutes an intent to defraud. \n \n* * * \n \nThe cases cited by defendants in support of their contention are distinguishable from the instant case in \nthat they involved theft by larceny. Since the crime of larceny is designed to protect a person’s possessory \ninterest in property whereas the crime of false pretenses protects one’s title interest, the requirement of a \npermanent deprivation is appropriate to the former. Accordingly, we hold that an intent to repay a loan \nobtained on the basis of a false representation of the security for the loan is no defense. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n271 \n \n* * * \n \nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Cases under \nthe Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 reflected the view both that knowledge or intent were not \nrequired to be proved in prosecutions under its criminal provisions, and that responsible corporate agents \ncould be subjected to the liability thereby imposed. \n* * * \n \nThe rationale of the interpretation given the Act in Dotterweich…has been confirmed in our subsequent \ncases. Thus, the Court has reaffirmed the proposition that the public interest in the purity of its food is so \ngreat as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors. \n \nThus Dotterweich and the cases which have followed reveal that in providing sanctions which reach and \ntouch the individuals who execute the corporate mission—and this is by no means necessarily confined to \na single corporate agent or employee—the Act imposes not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy \nviolations when they occur but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that \nviolations will not occur. The requirements of foresight and vigilance imposed on responsible corporate \nagents are beyond question demanding, and perhaps onerous, but they are no more stringent than the \npublic has a right to expect of those who voluntarily assume positions of authority in business enterprises \nwhose services and products affect the health and well-being of the public that supports them. \n \n* * * \n \nReading the entire charge satisfies us that the jury’s attention was adequately focused on the issue of \nrespondent’s authority with respect to the conditions that formed the basis of the alleged violations. \nViewed as a whole, the charge did not permit the jury to find guilt solely on the basis of respondent’s \nposition in the corporation; rather, it fairly advised the jury that to find guilt it must find respondent “had \na responsible relation to the situation,” and “by virtue of his position…had…authority and responsibility” \nto deal with the situation. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n276 \nThe situation referred to could only be “food…held in unsanitary conditions in a warehouse with the result \nthat it consisted, in part, of filth or…may have been contaminated with filth.” \nOur conclusion that the Court of Appeals erred in its reading of the jury charge suggests as well our \ndisagreement with that court concerning the admissibility of evidence demonstrating that respondent was \nadvised by the FDA in 1970 of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. We are satisfied \nthat the Act imposes the highest standard of care and permits conviction of responsible corporate officials \nwho, in light of this standard of care, have the power to prevent or correct violations of its provisions. \n \n* * * \n \nReversed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Most criminal law requires a specific \nintent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern \nlegislation, dispense with the requirement of intent). In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies.

One day a stranger comes to Bill to induce him to take part in a cocaine smuggling deal \nthat would net Bill millions of dollars. Unbeknownst to Bill, the stranger is an undercover policeman. Bill \ntells the stranger to go away. The stranger persists, and after five months of arguing and cajoling, the \nstranger wears down Bill’s will to resist.

You come out of your office and ask the customer to \ncalm down. He shouts at you. You tell him to leave. He refuses. So you and the salesclerk pick him up and \nshove him bodily out the door. He calls the police to have you arrested for assault. Should the police arrest \nyou? Assuming that they do, how would you defend yourself in court? \n3. Marilyn is arrested for arson against a nuclear utility, a crime under both state and federal law. She is \nconvicted in state court and sentenced to five years in jail. Then the federal government decides to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n278 \nprosecute her for the same offense. Does she have a double-jeopardy defense against the federal \nprosecution? \n4. Tectonics, a US corporation, is bidding on a project in Nigeria, and its employee wins the bid by secretly \ngiving $100,000 to the Nigerian public official that has the most say about which company will be awarded \nthe contract. The contract is worth $80 million, and Tectonics expects to make at least $50 million on the \nproject. Has a crime under US law been committed? \n5. Suppose that the CEO of Tectonics, Ted Nelson, is not actually involved in bribery of the Nigerian public \nofficial Adetutu Adeleke. Instead, suppose that the CFO, Jamie Skillset, is very accomplished at insulating \nboth top management and the board of directors from some of the “operational realities” within the \ncompany.

You have graduated from college and, after working hard for ten years, have scraped enough money \ntogether to make a down payment on a forty-acre farm within driving distance to the small city where you \nwork in Colorado. In town at lunch one day, you run into an old friend from high school, Hayley Mills, who \ntells you that she is saving her money to start a high-end consignment shop in town. You allow her to have \na room in your house for a few months until she has enough money to go into business. Over the following \nweeks, however, you realize that old acquaintances from high school are stopping by almost daily for short \nvisits. When you bring this up to Hayley, she admits that many old friends are now relying on her for \nmarijuana. She is not a licensed caregiver in Colorado and is clearly violating the law. Out of loyalty, you tell \nher that she has three weeks to move out, but you do not prevent her from continuing sales while she is \nthere. What crime have you committed? \n7.

            "chunk": "means straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting \nsomeone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet \nthe law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a \nremedy for \"defaming\" someone, orally or in writing, to others. \n \nAlthough the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines. More and \nmore people injured by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of remedy through the \ncourts). Headlines boast of multimillion-dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations, \nagainst newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against oil companies that devastate entire \necosystems. All are examples of tort suits. \n \nThe law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by \nlegislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the \ncommon law (judicial decisions). Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules \nthat govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other. Through \ncontracts, individuals can craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other. In the absence of \ncontracts, tort law holds individuals legally accountable for the consequences of their actions. Those who \nsuffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated. \n \nMany acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious. But torts and crimes are different, and the \ndifference is worth noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society punishes the murderer; \nit does not usually compensate the family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a \nprivate wrong for which damages are owed. In a civil case, the tort victim or his family, not the state, \nbrings the action. The judgment against a defendant in a civil tort suit is usually expressed in monetary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n283 \nterms, not in terms of prison times or fines, and is the legal system’s way of trying to make up for the \nvictim’s loss. \n \nKinds of Torts \nThere are three kinds of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts, and strict liability torts. Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.

One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still another excuse is consent: two \nboxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear). \n \nDamages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n286 \nSince the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually \nmeasured by the extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the",

[2] The \ndefendant had set up No Trespassing signs after ten years of trespassing and housebreaking events, with \nthe loss of some household items. Windows had been broken, and there was “messing up of the property \nin general.” The defendants had boarded up the windows and doors in order to stop the intrusions and \nfinally had set up a shotgun trap in the north bedroom of the house. One defendant had cleaned and oiled \nhis 20-gauge shotgun and taken it to the old house where it was secured to an iron bed with the barrel \npointed at the bedroom door. “It was rigged with wire from the doorknob to the gun’s trigger so would fire \nwhen the door was opened.” The angle of the shotgun was adjusted to hit an intruder in the legs. The \nspring could not be seen from the outside, and no warning of its presence was posted. \n \nThe plaintiff, Katko, had been hunting in the area for several years and considered the property \nabandoned. He knew it had long been uninhabited. He and a friend had been to the house and found \nseveral old bottles and fruit jars that they took and added to their collection of antiques. When they made \na second trip to the property, they entered by removing a board from a porch window. When the plaintiff \nopened the north bedroom door, the shotgun went off and struck him in the right leg above the ankle \nbone. Much of his leg was blown away. While Katko knew he had no right to break and enter the house \nwith intent to steal bottles and fruit jars, the court held that a property owner could not protect an \nunoccupied boarded-up farmhouse by using a spring gun capable of inflicting death or serious injury. \n \nIn Katko, there is an intentional tort. But what if someone trespassing is injured by the negligence of the \nlandowner? States have differing rules about trespass and negligence. In some states, a trespasser is only \nprotected against the gross negligence of the landowner. In other states, trespassers may be owed the duty \nof due care on the part of the landowner. The burglar who falls into a drained swimming pool, for \nexample, may have a case against the homeowner unless the courts or legislature of that state have made \nit clear that trespassers are owed the limited duty to avoid gross negligence. Or a very small child may \nwander off his own property and fall into a gravel pit on a nearby property and suffer death or serious \ninjury; if the pit should (in the exercise of due care) have been filled in or some barrier erected around it, \nthen there was negligence. But if the state law holds that the duty to trespassers is only to avoid gross \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n291 \nnegligence, the child’s family would lose, unless the state law makes an exception for very young \ntrespassers. In general, guests, licensees, and invitees are owed a duty of due care; a trespasser may not be \nowed such a duty, but states have different rules on this. \n \nIntentional Interference with Contractual Relations \nTortious interference with a contract can be established by proving four elements: \n \n1. There was a contract between the plaintiff and a third party. \n2. The defendant knew of the contract. \n3. The defendant improperly induced the third party to breach the contract or made performance of the \ncontract impossible. \n4. There was injury to the plaintiff. \n \nIn a famous case of contract interference, Texaco was sued by Pennzoil for interfering with an agreement \nthat Pennzoil had with Getty Oil. After complicated negotiations between Pennzoil and Getty, a takeover \nshare price was struck, a memorandum of understanding was signed, and a press release announced the \nagreement in principle between Pennzoil and Getty. Texaco’s lawyers, however, believed that Getty oil was \n“still in play,” and before the lawyers for Pennzoil and Getty could complete the paperwork for their \nagreement, Texaco announced it was offering Getty shareholders an additional $12.50 per share over \nwhat Pennzoil had offered. \n \nTexaco later increased its offer to $228 per share, and the Getty board of directors soon began dealing \nwith Texaco instead of Pennzoil. Pennzoil decided to sue in Texas state court for tortious interference with \na contract. After a long trial, the jury returned an enormous verdict against Texaco: $7.53 billion in actual \ndamages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The verdict was so large that it would have bankrupted \nTexaco. Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution",

If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution \nMalicious prosecution is the tort of causing someone to be prosecuted for a criminal act, knowing that \nthere was no probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committed the crime. The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3] \n \nA statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A \nstatement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major \nnetwork weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show \nthat the words were aimed at them. But statements about large groups will not support an action for \ndefamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor). \nThe law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That a person did not intend to defame is \nordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, \nmagazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due care \nis usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel \ncannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else. Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel. In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement. It may be difficult to \nestablish damages, however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the \nslander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

If a driver runs a red light, we can say that he is negligent \nbecause a driver must always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be able to stop if it is. \nSuppose that the driver was carrying a badly injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing \ndown at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n298 \nseeing him, drove into the intersection anyway and crashed into him. Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot? (Answer: in most cases, yes.) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n299 \nDespite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable man is one on which most negligence cases \nultimately turn. If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed \nan unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most \ninstances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do. The reasonable man stops for \ntraffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs \nsurgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of \nhis grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions \nto avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The \"reasonable man\" standard imposes hindsight \non the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may \nsometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable. \n \nDuty of Care and Its Breach \nThe law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person. If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in \nthis interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might \nsubject us to liability for its effect on someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the \nnumber of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful. \n \nIn general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the \ndrowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase. For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold.",

For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold. \nThis limitation was known as the rule of privity. And users who were not immediate purchasers were said \nnot to be in privity with a supplier or manufacturer. In 1916, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, then on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n300 \nNew York Court of Appeals, penned an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of privity, \nthough it would take half a century before the last state—Mississippi in 1966—would fall in line. \nDetermining a duty of care can be a vexing problem. Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of \nmedical ethics to respect the confidences of their patients. Suppose a patient tells a psychiatrist that he \nintends to kill his girlfriend. Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn prospective victim? \nThe California Supreme Court has said yes. [1] \n \nEstablishing a breach of the duty of due care where the defendant has violated a statute or municipal \nordinance is eased considerably with the doctrine of negligence per se, a doctrine common to all US \nstate courts. If a legislative body sets a minimum standard of care for particular kinds of acts to protect a \ncertain set of people from harm and a violation of that standard causes harm to someone in that set, the \ndefendant is negligent per se. If Harvey is driving sixty-five miles per hour in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour \nzone when he crashes into Haley’s car and the police accident report establishes that or he otherwise \nadmits to going ten miles per hour over the speed limit, Haley does not have to prove that Harvey has \nbreached a duty of due care. She will only have to prove that the speeding was an actual and proximate \ncause of the collision and will also have to prove the extent of the resulting damages to her. \n \nCausation: Actual Cause and Proximate Cause \n“For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost,” as the old saying has it. Virtually any cause of an injury can be \ntraced to some preceding cause. The problem for the law is to know when to draw the line between causes \nthat are immediate and causes too remote for liability reasonably to be assigned to them. In tort theory, \nthere are two kinds of causes that a plaintiff must prove: actual cause and proximate \ncause. Actual cause (causation in fact) can be found if the connection between the defendant’s act \nand the plaintiff’s injuries passes the “but for” test: if an injury would not have occurred “but for” the \ndefendant’s conduct, then the defendant is the cause of the injury. Still, this is not enough causation to \ncreate liability. The injuries to the plaintiff must also be foreseeable, or not “too remote,” for the \ndefendant’s act to create liability. This is proximate cause: a cause that is not too remote or \nunforseeable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n301 \nSuppose that the person who was injured was not one whom a reasonable person could have expected to \nbe harmed. Such a situation was presented in one of the most famous US tort cases, Palsgraf v. Long \nIsland Railroad (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"), which was decided by Judge Benjamin Cardozo. Although Judge \nCardozo persuaded four of his seven brethren to side with his position, the closeness of the case \ndemonstrates the difficulty that unforeseeable consequences and unforeseeable plaintiffs present. \n \nDamages \nFor a plaintiff to win a tort case, she must allege and prove that she was injured. The fear that she might \nbe injured in the future is not a sufficient basis for a suit. This rule has proved troublesome in medical \nmalpractice and industrial disease cases. A doctor’s negligent act or a company’s negligent exposure of a \nworker to some form of contamination might not become manifest in the body for years. In the meantime, \nthe tort statute of limitations might have run out, barring the victim from suing at all. An increasing \nnumber of courts have eased the plaintiff’s predicament by ruling that the statute of limitations does not \nbegin to run until the victim discovers that she has been injured or contracted a disease. \n \nThe law allows an exception to the general rule that damages must be shown when the plaintiff stands in \ndanger of immediate injury from a hazardous activity. If you discover your neighbor experimenting with \nexplosives in his basement, you could bring suit to enjoin him from further experimentation, even though \nhe has not yet blown up his house—and yours.",

Factual \nissues are for the jury to resolve. Since it is frequently difficult to make out the requisite proof, the law \nallows certain presumptions and rules of evidence that ease the plaintiff’s task, on the ground that without \nthem substantial injustice would be done. One important rule goes by the Latin \nphrase res ipsa loquitur, meaning “the thing speaks for itself.” The best evidence is always the most \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n302 \ndirect evidence: an eyewitness account of the acts in question. But eyewitnesses are often unavailable, and \nin any event they frequently cannot testify directly to the reasonableness of someone’s conduct, which \ninevitably can only be inferred from the circumstances. \n \nIn many cases, therefore, circumstantial evidence (evidence that is indirect) will be the only evidence \nor will constitute the bulk of the evidence. Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no \none saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly \nconclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference \nof negligence. A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of \nnegligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, \nand the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the \nmanagement use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the \ndefendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] \n \nIf a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane \ncrashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the \ndefendants, that there was negligence. The plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining \nprecisely how the accident occurred. A defendant can always offer evidence that he acted reasonably—for \nexample, that the flour barrel was securely fastened and that a bolt of lightning, for which he was not \nresponsible, broke its bands, causing it to roll out the window. But testimony by the factory employees \nthat they secured the barrel, in the absence of any further explanation, will not usually serve to rebut the \ninference. That the defendant was negligent does not conclude the inquiry or automatically entitle the \nplaintiff to a judgment. Tort law provides the defendant with several excuses, some of which are discussed \nbriefly in the next section. \nExcuses \nThere are more excuses (defenses) than are listed here, but contributory negligence or comparative \nnegligence, assumption of risk, and act of God are among the principal defenses that will completely or \npartially excuse the negligence of the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n303 \nContributory and Comparative Negligence \nUnder an old common-law rule, it was a complete defense to show that the plaintiff in a negligence suit \nwas himself negligent. Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most of the fault being chargeable to \nthe defendant, the court would dismiss the suit if the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to his injury. In a few \nstates today, this rule of contributory negligence is still in effect. Although referred to as negligence, \nthe rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which the defendant is charged, because the \nplaintiff’s only error in such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have been, whereas the \ndefendant is charged with conduct careless toward others. This rule was so manifestly unjust in many \ncases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version \nof comparative negligence. Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned \naccording to the defendant’s degree of culpability. For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages.",

The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she \nmust suffer the consequences. \n \nThe assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways. The plaintiff may have formally agreed with the \ndefendant before entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of liability should injury \noccur. (“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I \nhaven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the \ndefendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is \nhit by a line drive in a ballpark). Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known in advance \nto have been created by the defendant’s negligence (failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do \nso, such as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be drunk). \n \nThe difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing line between subjectivity and objectivity. If the \nplaintiff had no actual knowledge of the risk, he cannot be held to have assumed it. On the other hand, it is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n304 \neasy to claim that you did not appreciate the danger, and the courts will apply an objective standard of \ncommunity knowledge (a “but you should have known” test) in many situations. When the plaintiff has no \nreal alternative, however, assumption of risk fails as a defense (e.g., a landlord who negligently fails to \nlight the exit to the street cannot claim that his tenants assumed the risk of using it). \n \nAt the turn of the century, courts applied assumption of risk in industrial cases to bar relief to workers \ninjured on the job. They were said to assume the risk of dangerous conditions or equipment. This rule has \nbeen abolished by workers’ compensation statutes in most states. \n \nAct of God \nTechnically, the rule that no one is responsible for an “act of God,” or force majeure as it is sometimes \ncalled, is not an excuse but a defense premised on a lack of causation. If a force of nature caused the harm, \nthen the defendant was not negligent in the first place. A marina, obligated to look after boats moored at \nits dock, is not liable if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was possible destroys \nsomeone’s vessel. However, if it is foreseeable that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by \na natural event, then there is liability. For example, a work crew failed to remove residue explosive gas \nfrom an oil barge. Lightning hit the barge, exploded the gas, and injured several workmen. The plaintiff \nrecovered damages against the company because the negligence consisted in the failure to guard against \nany one of a number of chance occurrences that could ignite the gas. [3] \n \nVicarious Liability \nLiability for negligent acts does not always end with the one who was negligent. Under certain \ncircumstances, the liability is imputed to others. For example, an employer is responsible for the \nnegligence of his employees if they were acting in the scope of employment. This rule of vicarious liability \nis often called respondeat superior, meaning that the higher authority must respond to claims brought \nagainst one of its agents. Respondeat superior is not limited to the employment relationship but extends \nto a number of other agency relationships as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n305 \nLegislatures in many states have enacted laws that make people vicariously liable for acts of certain people \nwith whom they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency. It is common, for example, for \nthe owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car. So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others. In these situations, although the injurious \nact of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) \nis not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now",

The trial court accordingly reduced the amount of the award against the \nUniversity to $ 5,256,000. \n \nThe University moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, a new trial. The \ntrial court granted the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, holding that as a matter of law, \nno reasonable jury could have found that the University was more negligent than Whitlock, and that the \njury’s monetary award was the result of sympathy, passion or prejudice. \nA panel of the court of appeals reversed…by a divided vote. Whitlock v. University of Denver, 712 P.2d \n1072 (Colo. App. 1985). The court of appeals held that the University owed Whitlock a duty of due care to \nremove the trampoline from the fraternity premises or to supervise its use.…The case was remanded to \nthe trial court with orders to reinstate the verdict and damages as determined by the jury. The University \nthen petitioned for certiorari review, and we granted that petition. \n \nII. \nA negligence claim must fail if based on circumstances for which the law imposes no duty of care upon the \ndefendant for the benefit of the plaintiff. [Citations] Therefore, if Whitlock’s judgment against the \nUniversity is to be upheld, it must first be determined that the University owed a duty of care to take \nreasonable measures to protect him against the injury that he sustained. \n \nWhether a particular defendant owes a legal duty to a particular plaintiff is a question of law. [Citations] \n“The court determines, as a matter of law, the existence and scope of the duty—that is, whether the \nplaintiff’s interest that has been infringed by the conduct of the defendant is entitled to legal protection.” \n[Citations] In Smith v. City & County of Denver, 726 P.2d 1125 (Colo. 1986), we set forth several factors to \nbe considered in determining the existence of duty in a particular case: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n315 \nWhether the law should impose a duty requires consideration of many factors including, for \nexample, the risk involved, the foreseeability and likelihood of injury as weighed against the \nsocial utility of the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against injury or \nharm, and the consequences of placing the burden upon the actor. \n \n…A court’s conclusion that a duty does or does not exist is “an expression of the sum total of those \nconsiderations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is [or is not] entitled to protection.” \n… \nWe believe that the fact that the University is charged with negligent failure to act rather than negligent \naffirmative action is a critical factor that strongly militates against imposition of a duty on the University \nunder the facts of this case. In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the \nlaw has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active \nmisconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps \nto protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373. Liability for nonfeasance was slow to \nreceive recognition in the law. “The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by \n‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has \nat least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his \naffairs.” Id. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) summarizes the law on this point as follows: \n \nThe fact that an actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s \naid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action. \n \nImposition of a duty in all such cases would simply not meet the test of fairness under contemporary \nstandards. \n \nIn nonfeasance cases the existence of a duty has been recognized only during the last century in situations \ninvolving a limited group of special relationships between parties. Such special relationships are \npredicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies \nthe imposition of a duty to act.” W.

The plaintiff \ndoes not complain of any affirmative action taken by the University, but asserts instead that the \nUniversity owed to Whitlock the duty to assure that the fraternity’s trampoline was used only under \nsupervised conditions comparable to those in a gymnasium class, or in the alternative to cause the \ntrampoline to be removed from the front lawn of the Beta house.…If such a duty is to be recognized, it \nmust be grounded on a special relationship between the University and Whitlock. According to the \nevidence, there are only two possible sources of a special relationship out of which such a duty could arise \nin this case: the status of Whitlock as a student at the University, and the lease between the University and \nthe fraternity of which Whitlock was a member. We first consider the adequacy of the student-university \nrelationship as a possible basis for imposing a duty on the University to control or prohibit the use of the \ntrampoline, and then examine the provisions of the lease for that same purpose. \n \nA. \nThe student-university relationship has been scrutinized in several jurisdictions, and it is generally agreed \nthat a university is not an insurer of its students’ safety. [Citations] The relationship between a university \nand its students has experienced important change over the years. At one time, college administrators and \nfaculties stood in loco parentis to their students, which created a special relationship “that imposed a duty \non the college to exercise control over student conduct and, reciprocally, gave the students certain rights \nof protection by the college.” Bradshaw, 612 F.2d at 139. However, in modern times there has evolved a \ngradual reapportionment of responsibilities from the universities to the students, and a corresponding \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n317 \ndeparture from the in loco parentis relationship. Id. at 139–40. Today, colleges and universities are \nregarded as educational institutions rather than custodial ones. Beach, 726 P.2d at 419 (contrasting \ncolleges and universities with elementary and high schools). \n… \n…By imposing a duty on the University in this case, the University would be encouraged to exercise more \ncontrol over private student recreational choices, thereby effectively taking away much of the \nresponsibility recently recognized in students for making their own decisions with respect to private \nentertainment and personal safety. Such an allocation of responsibility would “produce a repressive and \ninhospitable environment, largely inconsistent with the objectives of a modern college \neducation.” Beach, 726 P.2d at 419. \n \nThe evidence demonstrates that only in limited instances has the University attempted to impose \nregulations or restraints on the private recreational pursuits of its students, and the students have not \nlooked to the University to assure the safety of their recreational choices. Nothing in the University’s \nstudent handbook, which contains certain regulations concerning student conduct, reflects an effort by \nthe University to control the risk-taking decisions of its students in their private recreation.…Indeed, \nfraternity and sorority self-governance with minimal supervision appears to have been fostered by the \nUniversity. \n \n… \n \nAside from advising the Beta house on one occasion to put the trampoline up when not in use, there is no \nevidence that the University officials attempted to assert control over trampoline use by the fraternity \nmembers. We conclude from this record that the University’s very limited actions concerning safety of \nstudent recreation did not give Whitlock or the other members of campus fraternities or sororities any \nreason to depend upon the University for evaluation of the safety of trampoline use.…Therefore, we",

Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a \nnineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law. As he \nput it: \n \n(F)rom a condition of society in which all the relations of Persons are summed up in the relations \nof Family, we seem to have steadily moved towards a phase of social order in which all these \nrelations arise from the free agreement of Individuals. . . .

So too the status of the \nSon under Power has no true place in the law of modern European societies. If any civil \nobligation binds together the Parent and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives \nits legal validity.... If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to \nsignify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we \nmay say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from \nStatus to Contract. [1] \n \nThis movement was not accidental. It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the \nfifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy \nwith all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, \ncommercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n330 \nContract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan. It was a response to \nchanging conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted, preferring the quieter, imagined \npastoral life of their forefathers. Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, \ndid a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with modem capitalism. \n \nContract Defined \nAs usual in the law, the legal definition of “contract” is formalistic. The Restatement says: “A contract is \na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which \nthe law in some way recognizes as a duty.” (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 1) Similarly, the \nUniform Commercial Code says: “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the \nparties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.” (Section 1-201(11)) A \nshort-hand definition is: “A contract is a legally enforceable promise.” \n \nEconomic View of Contract Law \nIn An Economic Analysis of Law (1973), Judge Richard A. Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading",

Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement. For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car. Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you.",

Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages. When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n352 \nprice as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in \nthe event of breach. \n \nIncidental Damages \nSuppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search. After one year the \nprofessor quits to take a job elsewhere, in breach of her contract. If City College has to pay $5000 more to \nfind a replacement for year, Blake is liable for that amount—that’s compensatory damages. But what if it \ncosts City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and interview a replacement? City College can \nclaim that, too, as incidental damages which include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching \nparty after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. \n \nPunitive Damages \nPunitive damages are those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a civil action, in \nwhich criminal sanctions may be unavailable. They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; \nthey are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to \ndeter others from acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, \npunitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is \nalso a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of \ntorts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, \ndeliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some \nkinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security \nunder a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor \nwas not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort of conversion. Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law. The judge or jury may award at its discretion whatever sum is",

Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law. The judge or jury may award at its discretion whatever sum is \nbelieved necessary to redress the wrong or deter like conduct in the future. This means that a richer \nperson may be slapped with much heavier punitive damages than a poorer one in the appropriate case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n353 \nBut the judge in all cases may remit (lower) some or all of a punitive damage award if he or she considers \nit excessive. \n \nPunitive damage claims have been made in cases dealing with the refusal by insurance companies to \nhonor their contracts. Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are \ncharges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees. California has been the leader among \nthe state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints \nthat the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless \ncompanies. Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of \ncontract. \n \nSpecific Performance \nSpecific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which \nhe obligated himself in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be \nissued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is seeking \nenforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from \ndoing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate \nremedy.) Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental \nvalue because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while still \nexecutory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily. Specific \nperformance is an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach of contract to sell a unique \nitem (real estate is always unique). \n \nRestitution \nAs the word implies, restitution is a restoring to one party of what he gave to the other. Therefore, only \nto the extent that the injured party conferred a benefit on the other party may the injured party be \nawarded restitution. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n354 \nIf the claimant has given the other party a sum of money, there can be no dispute over the amount of the \nrestitution interest. Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom’s restitution \ninterest is $100. But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance. The courts \nhave considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the \ninjured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the \nproperty of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance. Mellors, a gardener, agrees to \nconstruct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500. After erecting \nthree, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased \nthe value of the Lady’s grounds by $800. If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s \nrestitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would \nhave cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends on who \nrepudiated the contract and for what reason. \n \nTort vs. Contract Remedies \nFrequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious conduct. A physician warrants her treatment as \nperfectly safe but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient for life. The patient could sue \nfor malpractice (tort) or for breach of warranty (contract). The choice involves at least four \nconsiderations: \n1. Statute of limitations. Most statutes of limitations prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort \nactions. \n2. Allowable damages. Punitive damages are more often permitted in tort actions, and certain kinds of \ninjuries are compensable in tort but not in contract suits—for example, pain and suffering. \n3. Expert testimony. In most cases, the use of experts would be the same in either tort or contract suits,",

Reppert \n432 S.W.2d 647 (Ky. 1968) \nR. L. Myre, Sr., Special Commissioner. \n \nThe sole question presented in this case is which of several claimants is entitled to an award for \ninformation leading to the apprehension and conviction of certain bank robbers.… \n \nOn June 12th or 13th, 1963, three armed men entered the First State Bank, Eubank, Kentucky, and with a \ndisplay of arms and threats robbed the bank of over $30,000 [about $208,000 in 2010 dollars]. Later in \nthe day they were apprehended by State Policemen Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert, \nplaced under arrest, and the entire loot was recovered. Later all of the prisoners were convicted and \nGarret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert appeared as witnesses at the trial. \n \nThe First State Bank of Eubank was a member of the Kentucky Bankers Association which provided and \nadvertised a reward of $500.00 for the arrest and conviction of each bank robber. Hence the outstanding \nreward for the three bank robbers was $1,500.00 [about $11,000 in 2010 dollars]. Many became \nclaimants for the reward and the Kentucky State Bankers Association being unable to determine the \nmerits of the claims for the reward asked the circuit court to determine the merits of the various claims \nand to adjudge who was entitled to receive the reward or share in it. All of the claimants were made \ndefendants in the action. \n \nAt the time of the robbery the claimants Murrell Denney, Joyce Buis, Rebecca McCollum and Jewell \nSnyder were employees of the First State Bank of Eubank and came out of the grueling situation with \ngreat credit and glory. Each one of them deserves approbation and an accolade. They were vigilant in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n360 \ndisclosing to the public and the peace officers the details of the crime, and in describing the culprits, and \ngiving all the information that they possessed that would be useful in capturing the robbers. Undoubtedly, \nthey performed a great service. It is in the evidence that the claimant Murrell Denney was conspicuous \nand energetic in his efforts to make known the robbery, to acquaint the officers as to the personal \nappearance of the criminals, and to give other pertinent facts. \n \nThe first question for determination is whether the employees of the robbed bank are eligible to receive or \nshare in the reward. The great weight of authority answers in the negative. [Citation] states the rule \nthusly: \n \n‘To the general rule that, when a reward is offered to the general public for the performance of some \nspecified act, such reward may be claimed by any person who performs such act, is the exception of \nagents, employees and public officials who are acting within the scope of their employment or official \nduties. * * *.’… \n \nAt the time of the robbery the claimants Murrell Denney, Joyce Buis, Rebecca McCollum, and Jewell \nSnyder were employees of the First State Bank of Eubank. They were under duty to protect and conserve \nthe resources and moneys of the bank, and safeguard every interest of the institution furnishing them \nemployment. Each of these employees exhibited great courage, and cool bravery, in a time of stress and \ndanger. The community and the county have recompensed them in commendation, admiration and high \npraise, and the world looks on them as heroes. But in making known the robbery and assisting in \nacquainting the public and the officers with details of the crime and with identification of the robbers, \nthey performed a duty to the bank and the public, for which they cannot claim a reward. \n \nThe claims of Corbin Reynolds, Julia Reynolds, Alvie Reynolds and Gene Reynolds also must fail. \nAccording to their statements they gave valuable information to the arresting officers. However, they did \nnot follow the procedure as set forth in the offer of reward in that they never filed a claim with the \nKentucky Bankers Association. It is well established that a claimant of a reward must comply with the \nterms and conditions of the offer of reward.

In 2000, the Ransoms decided to build a creamery on-site to \nprocess their milk and formed EBWS, LLC to operate the dairy-processing plant and to market the plant’s \nproducts. In July 2000, Earl Ransom, on behalf of EBWS, met with Britly’s president to discuss building \nthe creamery.…In January 2001, EBWS and Britly entered into a contract requiring Britly to construct a \ncreamery building for EBWS in exchange for $160,318.…The creamery was substantially completed by \nApril 15, 2001, and EBWS moved in soon afterward. On June 5, 2001, EBWS notified Britly of alleged \ndefects in construction. [EBWS continued to use the creamery pending the necessity to vacate it for three \nweeks when repairs were commenced]. \n \nOn September 12, 2001, EBWS filed suit against Britly for damages resulting from defective design and \nconstruction.… \n \nFollowing a three-day trial, the jury found Britly had breached the contract and its express warranty, and \nawarded EBWS: (1) $38,020 in direct damages, and (2) $35,711 in consequential damages.… \n \n…The jury’s award to EBWS included compensation for both direct and consequential damages that \nEBWS claimed it would incur while the facility closed for repairs. Direct damages [i.e., compensatory \ndamages] are for “losses that naturally and usually flow from the breach itself,” and it is not necessary that \nthe parties actually considered these damages. [Citation]. In comparison, special or consequential \ndamages “must pass the tests of causation, certainty and foreseeability, and, in addition, be reasonably \nsupposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract.” \n \n…The court ruled that EBWS could not recover for lost profits because it was not a going concern at the \ntime the contract was entered into, and profits were too speculative. The court concluded, however, that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n363 \nEBWS could submit evidence of other business losses, including future payment for unused milk and staff \nwages.… \n \nAt trial, Huyffer, the CEO of EBWS, testified that during a repairs closure the creamery would be required \nto purchase milk from adjacent Rock Bottom Farm, even though it could not process this milk. She \nadmitted that such a requirement was self-imposed as there was no written output contract between \nEBWS and the farm to buy milk. In addition, Huyffer testified that EBWS would pay its employees during \nthe closure even though EBWS has no written contract to pay its employees when they are not working. \nThe trial court allowed these elements of damages to be submitted to the jury, and the jury awarded \nEBWS consequential damages for unused milk and staff wages. \n \nOn appeal, Britly contends that because there is no contractual or legal obligation for EBWS to purchase \nmilk or pay its employees, these are not foreseeable damages.

EBWS counters that it is common \nknowledge that cows continue to produce milk, even if the processing plant is not working, and thus it is \nforeseeable that this loss would occur. We conclude that these damages are not the foreseeable result of \nBritly’s breach of the construction contract and reverse the award.… \n \n[W]e conclude that…it is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee that its failure to perform under the \ncontract would result in this type of damages. While we are sympathetic to EBWS’s contention that the \ncows continue to produce milk, even when the plant is closed down, this fact alone is not enough to \ndemonstrate that buying and dumping milk is a foreseeable result of Britly’s breach of the construction \ncontract. Here, the milk was produced by a separate and distinct entity, Rock Bottom Farm, which sold \nthe milk to EBWS.… \n \nSimilarly, EBWS maintained no employment agreements with its employees obligating it to pay wages \nduring periods of closure for repairs, dips in market demand, or for any other reason. Any losses EBWS \nmight suffer in the future because it chooses to pay its employees during a plant closure for repairs would \nbe a voluntary expense and not in Britly’s contemplation at the time it entered the construction contract. \nIt is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee losses incurred as a result of agreements that are informal in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n364 \nnature and carry no legal obligation on EBWS to perform. “[P]arties are not presumed to know the \ncondition of each other’s affairs nor to take into account contracts with a third party that is not \ncommunicated.” [Citation] While it is true that EBWS may have business reasons to pay its employees \neven without a contractual obligation, for example, to ensure employee loyalty, no evidence was \nintroduced at trial by EBWS to support a sound rationale for such considerations. Under these \ncircumstances, this business decision is beyond the scope of what Britly could have reasonably foreseen as \ndamages for its breach of contract.… \n \nIn addition, the actual costs of the wages and milk are uncertain.…[T]he the milk and wages here are \nfuture expenses, for which no legal obligation was assumed by EBWS, and which are separate from the \nterms of the parties’ contract. We note that at the time of the construction contract EBWS had not yet \nbegun to operate as a creamery and had no history of buying milk or paying employees. See [Citation] \n(explaining that profits for a new business are uncertain and speculative and not recoverable). Thus, both \nthe cost of the milk and the number and amount of wages of future employees that EBWS might pay in \nthe event of a plant closure for repairs are uncertain. \n \nAward for consequential damages is reversed.… \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why, according to EBWS’s CEO, would EBWS be required to purchase milk from adjacent Rock Bottom \nFarm, even though it could not process this milk? \n2. Surely it is well known in Vermont dairy country that dairy farmers can’t simply stop milking cows when no \nprocessing plant is available to take the milk—the cows will soon stop producing. Why was EBWS then not \nentitled to those damages which it will certainly suffer when the creamery is down for repairs? \n3. Britly (the contractor) must have known EBWS had employees that would be idled when the creamery shut \ndown for repairs. Why was it not liable for their lost wages? \n4. What could EBWS have done at the time of contracting to protect itself against the damages it would incur \nin the event the creamery suffered downtime due to faulty construction? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n365 \n \n \n \n \n8.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nIn this chapter we have seen that two fundamental sources of contract law are the common law as \ndeveloped in the state courts and as summarized in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, and the \nUniform Commercial Code for the sale of goods. \n \nSales law is a special type of contract law, governed by Article 2 of the UCC.

Understand why agency law is important. \n2. Recognize the recurring legal issues in agency law. \n3. Know the types of agents. \n4. Understand how the agency relationship is created. \n \n \nIntroduction to Agency Law \nWhy Is Agency Law Important, and What Is an Agent? \nAn agent is a person who acts in the name of and on behalf of another, having been given and assumed \nsome degree of authority to do so. Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—\nis carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships \nand other business organizations rely extensively on agents to conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each \npartner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the \ncorporation. \n \nThe existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature. He is said to \nhave been the first person from the Mayflower to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620; he was a carpenter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n372 \na cooper (barrel maker), and a diplomat. His agency task—of interest here—was celebrated in Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow’s “The Courtship of Miles Standish.” He was to woo Priscilla Mullins (d. 1680), \n“the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,” on behalf of Captain Miles Standish, a valiant soldier who was too shy \nto propose marriage. Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady. But Alden was so tongue-tied that his vaunted eloquence fell short, turned Priscilla cold toward \nthe object of Alden’s mission, and eventually led her to turn the tables in one of the most famous lines in \nAmerican literature and poetry: “Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?” John eventually did: the two \nwere married in 1623 in Plymouth. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency \nLet’s analyze this sequence of events in legal terms—recognizing, of course, that this example is an \nanalogy and that the law, even today, would not impose consequences on Alden for his failure to carry out \nCaptain Standish’s wishes. Alden was the captain’s agent: he was specifically authorized to speak in his \nname in a manner agreed on, toward a specified end, and he accepted the assignment in consideration of \nthe captain’s friendship. He had, however, a conflict of interest. He attempted to carry out the assignment, \nbut he did not perform according to expectations. Eventually, he wound up with the prize himself.

Could he have made promises to Priscilla on the captain’s \nbehalf—for example, that Standish would have built her a fine house? \n• \nCould he, if he committed a tort, have imposed liability on his principal? Suppose, for example, \nthat he had ridden at breakneck speed to reach Priscilla’s side and while en route ran into and \ninjured a pedestrian on the road. Could the pedestrian have sued Standish? \n• \nSuppose Alden had injured himself on the journey. Would Standish be liable to Alden? \n• \nIs Alden liable to Standish for stealing the heart of Priscilla—that is, for taking the “profits” of the \nenterprise for himself?",

These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant. Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v. Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from",

Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from \ncoverage accidents involving employees of the insureds. General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. \nPro Golf Association [3] involved such a situation. The insurance policy in question covered members of \nthe Professional Golfers Association. Gerald Hall, a golf pro employed by the local park department, was \nafforded coverage under the policy, which excluded “bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising \nout of and in the course of his employment by the insured.” That is, no employee of Hall’s would be \ncovered (rather, any such person would have coverage under workers’ compensation statutes). Bradley \nMartin, age thirteen, was at the golf course for junior league play. At Hall’s request, he agreed to retrieve \nor “shag” golf balls to be hit during a lesson Hall was giving; he was—as Hall put it—to be compensated \n“either through golf instructions or money or hotdogs or whatever.” During the course of the lesson, a golf \nball hit by Hall hit young Martin in the eye. If Martin was an employee, the insurance company would be \nliable; if he was not an employee, the insurance company would not liable. The trial court determined he \nwas not an employee. The evidence showed: sometimes the boys who “shagged” balls got paid, got golfing \ninstructions, or got food, so the question of compensation was ambiguous. Martin was not directed in how \nto perform (the admittedly simple) task of retrieving golf balls, no control was exercised over him, and no \nequipment was required other than a bag to collect the balls: “We believe the evidence is susceptible of \ndifferent inferences.…We cannot say that the decision of the trial court is against the manifest weight of \nthe evidence.” \n \nCreation of the Agency Relationship \nThe agency relationship can be created in two ways: by agreement (expressly) or by operation of law \n(constructively or impliedly). \n \n \nAgency Created by Agreement \nMost agencies are created by contract. Thus the general rules of contract law covered in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" govern the law of agency. But agencies can also be created without contract, by agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n379 \nTherefore, three contract principles are especially important: the first is the requirement for \nconsideration, the second for a writing, and the third concerns contractual capacity. \n \nConsideration \nAgencies created by consent—agreement—are not necessarily contractual. It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent. There are, however, a few situations in which",

A principal’s wishes may have been stated \nambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts \nreasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately \nrepudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to \nhim, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to \nliability to the principal.”[3] \n \nDuty Not to Attempt the Impossible or Impracticable \nThe principal says to the agent, “Keep working until the job is done.” The agent is not obligated to go \nwithout food or sleep because the principal misapprehended how long it would take to complete the job. \nNor should the agent continue to expend the principal’s funds in a quixotic attempt to gain business, sign \nup customers, or produce inventory when it is reasonably clear that such efforts would be in vain. \n \nDuty to Obey \nAs a general rule, the agent must obey reasonable directions concerning the manner of performance. \nWhat is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n385 \nprincipal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency. A principal may prescribe uniforms for \nvarious classes of employees, for instance, and a manufacturing company may tell its sales force what \nsales pitch to use on customers. On the other hand, certain tasks entrusted to agents are not subject to the \nprincipal’s control; for example, a lawyer may refuse to permit a client to dictate courtroom tactics. \n \nDuty to Give Information \nBecause the principal cannot be every place at once—that is why agents are hired, after all—much that is \nvital to the principal’s business first comes to the attention of agents. If the agent has actual notice or \nreason to know of information that is relevant to matters entrusted to him, he has a duty to inform the \nprincipal. This duty is especially critical because information in the hands of an agent is, under most \ncircumstances, imputed to the principal, whose legal liabilities to third persons may hinge on receiving \ninformation in timely fashion. Service of process, for example, requires a defendant to answer within a \ncertain number of days; an agent’s failure to communicate to the principal that a summons has been \nserved may bar the principal’s right to defend a lawsuit. The imputation to the principal of knowledge \npossessed by the agent is strict: even where the agent is acting adversely to the principal’s interests—for \nexample, by trying to defraud his employer—a third party may still rely on notification to the agent, unless \nthe third party knows the agent is acting adversely. \n \n“Shop Rights” Doctrine \nIn Grip Nut Co. v. Sharp, Sharp made a deal with Grip Nut Company that in return for a salary and \nbonuses as company president, he would assign to the company any inventions he made. [4] When the five-\nyear employment contract expired, Sharp continued to serve as chief executive officer, but no new \ncontract was negotiated concerning either pay or rights to inventions. During the next ten years, Sharp \ninvented a number of new products and developed new machinery to manufacture them; patent rights \nwent to the company. However, he made one invention with two other employees and they assigned the \npatent to him. A third employee invented a safety device and also assigned the patent to Sharp. At one \ntime, Sharp’s son invented a leakproof bolt and a process to manufacture it; these, too, were assigned to \nSharp.

Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his \nagent. \n \nGeneral Contract Duties \nThese duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal \nhas a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” [5] The principal is allowed, \nhowever, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty \nto inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of \nassigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may \nbe dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject \nthe principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n387 \nprincipal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends \non a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, \nand the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, \nand so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it. \n \nEmployment at Will \nUnder the traditional “employment-at-will” doctrine, an employee who is not hired for a specific period \ncan be fired at any time, for any reason (except bad reasons: an employee cannot be fired, for example, for \nreporting that his employer’s paper mill is illegally polluting groundwater). This doctrine has been much \ncriticized. \n \nDuty to Indemnify \nAgents commonly spend money pursuing the principal’s business. Unless the agreement explicitly \nprovides otherwise, the principal has a duty to indemnify or reimburse the agent. A familiar form of \nindemnity is the employee expense account. \n \nTort and Workers’ Compensation Duties \nThe employer owes the employee—any employee, not just agents—certain statutorily imposed tort and \nworkers’ compensation duties. \n \nBackground to Workers’ Compensation \nAndy, who works in a dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong shed. Andy warns his \nfellow employee Bill that he has done so. Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands on \nthe ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At \ncommon law, the answer would be no—three times no. First, the “fellow-servant” rule would bar recovery \nbecause the employer was held not to be responsible for torts committed by one employee against \nanother. Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the dynamite had been negligently stored by the \nemployer rather than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been dismissed. Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

In large numbers of cases, workers who were mutilated or killed on the job found themselves and \ntheir families without recompense. Union pressure and grass roots lobbying led to \nworkers’ compensation acts—statutory enactments that dramatically overhauled the law of torts as it \naffected employees. \n \n \nThe System in General \nWorkers’ compensation is a no-fault system. The employee gives up the right to sue the employer (and, in \nsome states, other employees) and receives in exchange predetermined compensation for a job-related \ninjury, regardless of who caused it. This trade-off was felt to be equitable to employer and employee: the \nemployee loses the right to seek damages for pain and suffering—which can be a sizable portion of any \njury award—but in return he can avoid the time-consuming and uncertain judicial process and assure \nhimself that his medical costs and a portion of his salary will be paid—and paid promptly. The employer \nmust pay for all injuries, even those for which he is blameless, but in return he avoids the risk of losing a \nbig lawsuit, can calculate his costs actuarially, and can spread the risks through insurance. \n \nMost workers’ compensation acts provide 100 percent of the cost of a worker’s hospitalization and \nmedical care necessary to cure the injury and relieve him from its effects. They also provide for payment \nof lost wages and death benefits. Even an employee who is able to work may be eligible to receive \ncompensation for specific injuries.

In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a \nnew logo for the hotel’s stationery. Andy has no implied authority to change the name or to commission \nthe artist, though he does have implied authority to engage a printer to replenish the stationery supply—\nand possibly to make some design changes in the letterhead. \n \nEven when there is no implied authority, in an emergency the agent may act in ways that would in the \nnormal course require specific permission from the principal. If unforeseen circumstances arise and it is \nimpracticable to communicate with the principal to find out what his wishes would be, the agent may do \nwhat is reasonably necessary in order to prevent substantial loss to his principal. During World War II, \nEastern Wine Corporation marketed champagne in a bottle with a diagonal red stripe that infringed the \ntrademark of a French producer. The French company had granted licenses to an American importer to \nmarket its champagne in the United States. The contract between producer and importer required the \nlatter to notify the French company whenever a competitor appeared to be infringing its rights and to \nrecommend steps by which the company could stop the infringement. The authority to institute suit was \nnot expressly conferred, and ordinarily the right to do so would not be inferred. Because France was under \nGerman occupation, however, the importer was unable to communicate with the producer, its principal. \nThe court held that the importer could file suit to enjoin Eastern Wine from continuing to display the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n420 \ninfringing red diagonal stripe, since legal action was “essential to the preservation of the principal’s \nproperty.” [3] \n \nThe rule that a person’s position can carry with it implied authority is fundamental to American business \npractice. But outside the United States this rule is not applicable, and the business executive traveling \nabroad should be aware that in civil-law countries it is customary to present proof of authority to transact \ncorporate business—usually in the form of a power of attorney. This is not always an easy task. Not only \nmust the power of the traveling executive be shown but the right of the corporate officer back in the \nUnited States to delegate authority must also be proven. \n \nApparent Authority \nIn the agency relationship, the agent’s actions in dealing with third parties will affect the legal rights of the \nprincipal. What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel. Estoppel is the doctrine \nthat a person will not now be allowed to deny a promise or assertion she previously made where there has \nbeen detrimental reliance on that promise or assertion. Estoppel is commonly used to avoid injustice. It \nmay be a substitute for the requirement of consideration in contract (making the promise of a gift \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n421 \nenforceable where the donee has relied upon the promise), and it is sometimes available to circumvent the \nrequirement of a writing under the Statute of Frauds. \n \nApparent authority can arise from prior business transactions.

However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers. Thus the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n429 \nIllinois Parental Responsibility Law provides the following: “The parent or legal guardian of an \nunemancipated minor who resides with such parent or legal guardian is liable for actual damages for the \nwillful or malicious acts of such minor which cause injury to a person or property.” [5] Several other states \nimpose a monetary limit on such liability. \n \nOther Torts Governed by Statute or Regulation \nThere are certain types of conduct that statutes or regulation attempt to control by placing the burden of \nliability on those presumably in a position to prevent the unwanted conduct. An example is the \n“Dramshop Act,” which in many states subjects the owner of a bar to liability if the bar continues to serve \nan intoxicated patron who later is involved in an accident while intoxicated. Another example involves the \nsale of adulterated or short-weight foodstuffs: the employer of one who sells such may be liable, even if \nthe employer did not know of the sales. \n \nPrincipal’s Criminal Liability \nAs a general proposition, a principal will not be held liable for an agent’s unauthorized criminal acts if the \ncrimes are those requiring specific intent. Thus a department store proprietor who tells his chief buyer to \nget the “best deal possible” on next fall’s fashions is not liable if the buyer steals clothes from the \nmanufacturer. A principal will, however, be liable if the principal directed, approved, or participated in \nthe crime. Cases here involve, for example, a corporate principal’s liability for agents’ activity in antitrust \nviolations—price-fixing is one such violation. \n \nThere is a narrow exception to the broad policy of immunity. Courts have ruled that under certain \nregulatory statutes and regulations, an agent’s criminality may be imputed to the principal, just as civil \nliability is imputed under Dramshop Acts. These include pure food and drug acts, speeding ordinances, \nbuilding regulations, child labor rules, and minimum wage and maximum hour legislation. Misdemeanor \ncriminal liability may be imposed upon corporations and individual employees for the sale or shipment of \nadulterated food in interstate commerce, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant may have had no \nactual knowledge that the food was adulterated at the time the sale or shipment was made. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n430 \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe principal will be liable for the employee’s torts in two circumstances: first, if the principal was directly \nresponsible, as in hiring a person the principal knew or should have known was incompetent or dangerous; \nsecond, if the employee committed the tort in the scope of business for the principal. This is the master-\nservant doctrine or respondeat superior. It imposes vicarious liability on the employer: the master (employer) \nwill be liable if the employee was in the zone of activity creating a risk for the employer (“zone of risk” test), \nthat is—generally—if the employee was where he was supposed to be, when he was supposed to be there, \nand the incident arose out of the employee’s interest (however perverted) in promoting the employer’s \nbusiness. \nSpecial cases of vicarious liability arise in several circumstances. For example, the owner of an automobile may \nbe liable for torts committed by one who borrows it, or if it is—even if indirectly—used for family purposes. \nParents are, by statute in many states, liable for their children’s torts. Similarly by statute, the sellers and \nemployers of sellers of alcohol or adulterated or short-weight foodstuffs may be liable. The employer of one \nwho commits a crime is not usually liable unless the employer put the employee up to the crime or knew that \na crime was being committed. But some prophylactic statutes impose liability on the employer for the \nemployee’s crime—even if the employee had no intention to commit it—as a means to force the employer to \nprevent such actions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Cockrell told Officer James to release her, but he continued to \nembrace her for approximately five minutes before continuing on to the jail. \n \nOn June 30, 1998, Cockrell returned to the Reservoir Patrol office to retrieve her driver’s license.

The motion alleged that the conduct \ndescribed by Cockrell was outside the course and scope of Officer James’s public employment as he was \nintending to satisfy his lustful urges. Cockrell responded to the motion arguing that the misconduct did \noccur in the course and scope of Officer James’s employment with the District and also that the \nmisconduct did not reach the level of a criminal offense such that the District could be found not liable \nunder the MTCA. \n \nThe trial court entered a final judgment granting the District’s motion for summary judgment and \ndismissing the complaint with prejudice.

Cockrell argues Officer James’s conduct, although inappropriate, \ndid not rise to the level of criminal conduct. Cockrell contends Officer James’s action of hugging Cockrell \nwas similar to an officer consoling a victim of a crime. Cockrell does admit that Officer James’s action of \nkissing her is more difficult to view as within the course and scope of his employment… \n \nThe District argues that although Officer James acted within the course and scope of his duties when he \narrested Cockrell, his later conduct, which was intended to satisfy his lustful desires, was outside the \nscope of his employment with it.… \n \n“Mississippi law provides that an activity must be in furtherance of the employer’s business to be within \nthe scope and course of employment.” [Citation] To be within the course and scope of employment, an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n450 \nactivity must carry out the employer’s purpose of the employment or be in furtherance of the employer’s \nbusiness.

Partnership law and tax law permit an investor to \nput capital into a limited partnership and realize tax benefits without liability for the acts of the general \npartners. \n \nEven if you do not plan to work within a partnership, it can be important to understand the law that \ngoverns it. Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order. An amended UPA appeared in 1992, and \nfurther amendments were promulgated in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. The NCCUL reports that thirty-\nnine states have adopted some version of the revised act. This chapter will discuss the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) as promulgated in 1997, but because not all jurisdictions have not adopted it, \nwhere RUPA makes significant changes, the original 1914 UPA will also be considered. [2] The NCCUL \nobserves in its “prefatory note” to the 1997 act: “The Revised Act is largely a series of ‘default rules’ that \ngovern the relations among partners in situations they have not addressed in a partnership agreement. \nThe primary focus of RUPA is the small, often informal, partnership. Larger partnerships generally have a \npartnership agreement addressing, and often modifying, many of the provisions of the partnership act.” [3] \n \nEntity Theory \nMeaning of “Legal Entity” \nA significant difference between a partnership and most other kinds of business organization relates to \nwhether, and the extent to which, the business is a legal entity. A legal entity is a person or group that the \nlaw recognizes as having legal rights, such as the right to own and dispose of property, to sue and be sued, \nand to enter into contracts; the entity theory is the concept of a business firm as a legal person, with \nexistence and accountability separate from its owners. When individuals carry out a common enterprise \nas partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said \nno. In other words, under the common-law theory, a partnership was but a convenient name for an",

Since they are not partners, the \npedestrian cannot sue them as if they were; hence Mr. Tut has no partnership liability. \n \nSuppose that Mr. Tot and Mr. Tut happened to go to a lumberyard together to purchase materials that Mr. \nTot intended to use to add a room to the house. Short of cash, Mr. Tot looks around and espies Mr. Tat, \nwho greets his two friends heartily by saying within earshot of the salesman who is debating whether to \nextend credit, “Well, how are my two partners this morning?” Messrs. Tot and Tut say nothing but smile \nfaintly at the salesman, who mistakenly but reasonably believes that the two are acknowledging the \npartnership. The salesman knows Mr. Tat well and assumes that since Mr. Tat is rich, extending credit to \nthe “partnership” is a “sure thing.” Messrs. Tot and Tut fail to pay. The lumberyard is entitled to collect \nfrom Mr. Tat, even though he may have forgotten completely about the incident by the time suit is filed. \nUnder Uniform Partnership Act Section 16(1), Mr. Tat would be liable for the debt as being part of \na partnership by estoppel.

Liability of Purported Partner. \n \n(a) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented \nby another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the \npurported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, \nrelying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. \n \nPartnership by estoppel has two elements: (1) a representation to a third party that there is in fact a \npartnership and (2) reliance by the third party on the representation. See Section 11.3.3 \"Partnership by \nEstoppel\", Chavers v. Epsco, Inc., for an example of partnership by estoppel. \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA partnership is any two or more persons—including corporate persons—carrying on a business as co-owners \nfor profit. A primary test of whether a partnership exists is whether there is a sharing of profits, though other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n471 \nfactors such as sharing decision making, sharing liabilities, and how the business is operated are also \nexamined. \nMost partnerships are expressly created. Several factors become important in the partnership agreement, \nwhether written or oral. These include the name of the business, the capital contributions of each partner, \nprofit sharing, and decision making. But a partnership can also arise by implication or by estoppel, where one \nhas held herself as a partner and another has relied on that representation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is it necessary—or at least useful—to have tests to determine whether a partnership exists? \n2. What elements of the business organization are examined to make this determination? \n3.

Joint ventures are also a way to avoid liability for a new project. A joint venture can be set up to do almost anything, from building a new shopping mall to developing a new computer software program. Joint ventures can be very successful. They can also be disastrous. In the late 1980s, a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company and Coca-Cola was formed to build a new theme park in Florida. The joint venture was a disaster, and the two companies have not worked together since."

The fifth paragraph forbade assignment of the \nagreement without permission of Chaiken. The sixth paragraph required Chaiken to hold and distribute \nall receipts. The final paragraph stated hours of work for Strazella and Spitzer and holidays. \n \nThe mere existence of an agreement labeled “partnership” agreement and the characterization of \nsignatories as “partners” docs not conclusively prove the existence of a partnership.

As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept. Co-owners should also contribute valuable consideration \nfor the creation of the business. Under paragraph two, however, Chaiken provides the barber chair (and \nimplicitly the barber shop itself), mirror, licenses and linen, while the other partners merely provide their \ntools and labor—nothing more than any barber-employee would furnish. Standing alone, however, mere \ncontribution of work and skill can be valuable consideration for a partnership agreement. \n \nPartnership interests may be assignable, although it is not a violation of partnership law to prohibit \nassignment in a partnership agreement.

If the partners should happen to continue their business beyond the \nterm fixed for it in their agreement, the terms of the agreement continue to apply. \n \nDuties Partners Owe Each Other \nAmong the duties partners owe each other, six may be called out here: (1) the duty to serve, (2) the duty of \nloyalty, (3) the duty of care, (4) the duty of obedience, (5) the duty to inform copartners, and (6) the duty \nto account to the partnership. These are all very similar to the duty owed by an agent to the principal, as \npartnership law is based on agency concepts. [2] \n \nDuty to Serve \nUnless otherwise agreed, expressly or impliedly, a partner is expected to work for the firm. The \npartnership, after all, is a profit-making co-venture, and it would not do for one to loaf about and still \nexpect to get paid. For example, suppose Joan takes her two-week vacation from the horse-stable \npartnership she operates with Sarah and Sandra. Then she does not return for four months because she \nhas gone horseback riding in the Southwest. She might end up having to pay if the partnership hired a \nsubstitute to do her work. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n493 \nIn general, this requires partners to put the firm’s interests ahead of their own. Partners are fiduciaries as \nto each other and as to the partnership, and as such, they owe a fiduciary duty to each other and the \npartnership. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty “something \nstricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most \nsensitive, is then the standard of behavior.” [3]Breach of the fiduciary duty gives rise to a claim for \ncompensatory, consequential, and incidental damages; recoupment of compensation; and—rarely—\npunitive damages. See Section 12.4.1 \"Breach of Partnership Fiduciary Duty\", Gilroy v. Conway, for an \nexample of breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n \nApplication of the Fiduciary Standard to Partnership Law \nUnder UPA, all partners are fiduciaries of each other—they are all principals and agents of each other—\nthough the word fiduciary was not used except in the heading to Section 21. The section reads, “Every \npartner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by \nhim without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, \nconduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.” \n \nSection 404 of RUPA specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other \npartners. It imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three circumstances: \n \n(1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived \nby the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use \nby the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership \nopportunity; \n \n(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership \nbusiness as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n494 \n(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business \nbefore the dissolution of the partnership. \n \nLimits on the Reach of the Fiduciary Duty \nThis sets out a fairly limited scope for application of the fiduciary standard, which is reasonable because \npartners do not delegate open-ended control to their copartners. Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached.",

In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty? Section 28 of UPA and RUPA Section 504 permit a judgment creditor to obtain \na charging order, which charges the partner’s interest in the partnership with obligation to satisfy the \njudgment. The court may appoint a receiver to ensure that partnership proceeds are paid to the judgment \ncreditor. But the creditor is not entitled to specific partnership property. The partner may always pay off \nthe debt and redeem his interest in the partnership. If the partner does not pay off the debt, the holder of \nthe charging order may acquire legal ownership of the partner’s interest. That confers upon the judgment \ncreditor an important power: he may, if the partnership is one at will, dissolve the partnership and claim \nthe partner’s share of the assets. For that reason, the copartners might wish to redeem the interest—pay \noff the creditor—in order to preserve the partnership. As with the voluntary assignment, the assignee of an \ninvoluntary assignment does not become a partner.

Section 403(b) of RUPA provides, “A partnership shall provide partners \nand their agents and attorneys access to its books and records. It shall provide former partners and their \nagents and attorneys access to books and records pertaining to the period during which they were \npartners. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy books and records during \nordinary business hours. A partnership may impose a reasonable charge, covering the costs of labor and \nmaterial, for copies of documents furnished.”[18] \n \nSection 19 of UPA is basically in accord. This means that without demand—and for any purpose—the \npartnership must provide any information concerning its business and affairs reasonably required for the \nproper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or the act; and on \ndemand, it must provide any other information concerning the partnership’s business and affairs, unless \nthe demand is unreasonable or improper. [19] Generally, the partnership agreement cannot deny the right \nto inspection. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n502 \nThe duty to account mentioned in Section 12.1.1 \"Duties Partners Owe Each Other\" of this chapter \nnormally means that the partners and the partnership should keep reasonable records so everyone can tell \nwhat is going on. A formal accounting under UPA is different. \n \nUnder UPA Section 22, any partner is entitled to a formal account (or accounting) of the partnership \naffairs under the following conditions: \n \n1. If he is wrongfully excluded from the partnership business or possession of its property by his \ncopartners; \n2. If the right exists under the terms of any agreement; \n3. If a partner profits in violation of his fiduciary duty (as per UPA 22); and \n4. Whenever it is otherwise just and reasonable. \n \nAt common law, partners could not obtain an accounting except in the event of dissolution. But from an \nearly date, equity courts would appoint a referee, auditor, or special master to investigate the books of a \nbusiness when one of the partners had grounds to complain, and UPA broadened considerably the right to \nan accounting. The court has plenary power to investigate all facets of the business, evaluate claims, \ndeclare legal rights among the parties, and order money judgments against any partner in the wrong. \n \nUnder RUPA Section 405, this “accounting” business is somewhat modified. Reflecting the entity theory, \nthe partnership can sue a partner for wrongdoing, which is not allowed under UPA. Moreover, to quote \nfrom the Official Comment, RUPA “provides that, during the term of the partnership, partners may \nmaintain a variety of legal or equitable actions, including an action for an accounting, as well as a final",

                    "answer": "Involuntary assignment is a legal term that refers to the transfer of a partner's interest in a partnership without their consent. This can occur when a partner is sued and a judgment is rendered against them, or when a creditor forecloses on a security interest held by the partner. In either case, the judgment creditor or the creditor who foreclosed on the security interest may be able to seize partnership property to satisfy the judgment or debt. However, the partner may be able to redeem their interest in the partnership by paying off the debt or obtaining a charging order from the court."

Understand the partners’ and partnership’s tort and criminal liability. \n3. Describe the partners’ and partnership’s tax liability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n505 \n \n \nBy express terms, the law of agency applies to partnership law. Every partner is an agent of the \npartnership for the purpose of its business. Consequently, the following discussion will be a review of \nagency law, covered in Chapter 11 \"Partnerships: General Characteristics and Formation\" as it applies to \npartnerships. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) adds a few new wrinkles to the liability issue. \n \nContract Liability \nLiability of the Partnership \nRecall that an agent can make contracts on behalf of a principal under three types of authority: express, \nimplied, and apparent. Express authority is that explicitly delegated to the agent, implied authority is \nthat necessary to the carrying out of the express authority, and apparent authority is that which a third \nparty is led to believe has been conferred by the principal on the agent, even though in fact it was not or it \nwas revoked. When a partner has authority, the partnership is bound by contracts the partner makes on \nits behalf. Section 12.4.2 \"Partnership Authority, Express or Apparent\", Hodge v. Garrett, discusses all \nthree types of authority. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 305 of RUPA restates agency law: “A partnership is liable for loss or injury, or for a penalty \nincurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the \nordinary course” [1] of partnership business or with its authority. The ability of a partner to bind the \npartnership to contract liability is problematic, especially where the authority is apparent: the firm denies \nliability, lawsuits ensue, and unhappiness generally follows. \n \nBut the firm is not liable for an act not apparently in the ordinary course of business, unless the act was \nauthorized by the others. [2] Section 401(j) of RUPA requires the unanimous consent of the partners for a \ngrant of authority outside the ordinary course of business, unless the partnership agreement provides \notherwise. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n506 \nUnder the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) Section 9(3), the firm is not liable for five actions that no single \npartner has implied or apparent authority to do, because they are not “in the ordinary course of \npartnership.” These actions are: (1) assignment of partnership property for the benefit of creditors, (2) \ndisposing of the firm’s goodwill (selling the right to do business with the firm’s clients to another \nbusiness), (3) actions that make it impossible to carry on the business, (4) confessing a judgment against \nthe partnership, and (5) submitting a partnership claim or liability. RUPA omits that section, leaving it to \nthe courts to decide the outer limits of the agency power of a partner. In any event, unauthorized actions \nby a partner may be ratified by the partnership. \n \nPartnership “Statements” \nNew under RUPA is the ability of partnerships, partners, or even nonpartners to issue and file \n“statements” that announce to the world the establishment or denial of authority. The goal here is to \ncontrol the reach of apparent authority. There are several kinds of statements authorized. \n \nA statement of partnership authority is allowed by RUPA Section 303. It specifies the names of the \npartners authorized, or not authorized, to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership and any \nother matters. The most important goal of the statement of authority is to facilitate the transfer of real \nproperty held in the name of the partnership. A statement must specify the names of the partners \nauthorized to execute an instrument transferring that property. \nA statement of denial, RUPA Section 304, operates to allow partners (and persons named as partners) \nan opportunity to deny any fact asserted in a statement of partnership authority. \n \nA statement of dissociation, RUPA Section 704, may be filed by a partnership or a dissociated partner, \ninforming the world that the person is no longer a partner. This tells the world that the named person is \nno longer in the partnership. \n \nThere are three other statements authorized: a statement of qualification establishes that the partnership \nhas satisfied all conditions precedent to the qualification of the partnership as a limited liability \npartnership; a statement of foreign qualification means a limited liability partnership is qualified and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n507 \nregistered to do business in a state other than that in which it is originally registered; and a statement of \namendment or cancellation of any of the foregoing.

[3] Limited liability partnerships are taken up \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nGenerally, RUPA Section 105 allows partnerships to file these statements with the state secretary of state’s \noffice; those affecting real estate need to be filed with (or also with) the local county land recorder’s office. \nThe notices bind those who know about them right away, and they are constructive notice to the world \nafter ninety days as to authority to transfer real property in the partnership’s name, as to dissociation, and \nas to dissolution. However, as to other grants or limitations of authority, “only a third party who knows or \nhas received a notification of a partner’s lack of authority in an ordinary course transaction is bound.” [4] \n \nSince RUPA is mostly intended to provide the rules for the small, unsophisticated partnership, it is \nquestionable whether these arcane “statements” are very often employed. \n \nPersonal Liability of Partners, in General \nIt is clear that the partnership is liable for contracts by authorized partners, as discussed in the preceding \nparagraphs. The bad thing about the partnership as a form of business organization is that it imposes \nliability on the partners personally and without limit. Section 306 of RUPA provides that “all partners are \nliable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or \nprovided by law.” [5] Section 13 of UPA is in accord. \n \nLiability of Existing Partners \nContract liability is joint and several: that is, all partners are liable (“joint”) and each is “several.” (We \nusually do not use several in modern English to mean “each”; it’s an archaic usage.) But—and here’s the \nintrusion of entity theory—generally RUPA requires the judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s \nassets before going after the separate assets of a partner. Thus under RUPA the partners \nare guarantors of the partnership’s liabilities. [6] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n508 \nUnder UPA, contract liability is joint only, not also several. This means the partners must be sued in a \njoint action brought against them all. A partner who is not named cannot later be sued by a creditor in a \nseparate proceeding, though the ones who were named could see a proportionate contribution from the \nones who were not. \n \nLiability of Incoming Partners \nUnder RUPA Section 306(b), a new partner has no personal liability to existing creditors of the \npartnership, and only her capital investment in the firm is at risk for the satisfaction of existing \npartnership debts. Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners. Even after winning a judgment, the plaintiff may \nsue other partners unnamed in the original action. Each and every partner is separately liable for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n509",

In some circumstances, a court will order dissolution upon the \napplication of a purchaser of a partner’s interest. [4] \n \nEffect of Dissolution on Authority \nFor the most part, dissolution terminates the authority of the partners to act for the partnership. The only \nsignificant exceptions are for acts necessary to wind up partnership affairs or to complete transactions \nbegun but not finished at the time of dissolution. [5] Notwithstanding the latter exception, no partner can \nbind the partnership if it has dissolved because it has become unlawful to carry on the business or if the \npartner seeking to exercise authority has become bankrupt. \n \nAfter Dissolution \nAfter a partnership has dissolved, it can follow one of two paths. It can carry on business as a new \npartnership, or it can wind up the business and cease operating (see Figure 12.2 \"Alternatives Following \nUPA Dissolution\"). \n \nFigure 12.2 Alternatives Following UPA Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n514 \n \nForming a New Partnership \nIn order to carry on the business as a new partnership, there must be an agreement—preferably as part of \nthe original partnership agreement but maybe only after dissolution (and maybe oral)—that upon \ndissolution (e.g., if a partner dies, retires, or quits) the others will regroup and carry on. \n \nUnder UPA the remaining partners have the right to carry on when (1) the dissolution was in \ncontravention of the agreement, (2) a partner was expelled according to the partnership agreement, or (3) \nall partners agree to carry on. [6] \n \nWhether the former partner dies or otherwise quits the firm, the noncontinuing one or his, her, or its legal \nrepresentative is entitled to an accounting and to be paid the value of the partnership interest, less \ndamages for wrongful dissolution. [7] The firm may need to borrow money to pay the former partner or her \nestate; or, in the case of a deceased partner, the money to pay the former partner is obtained through a life \ninsurance buyout policy. \n \nPartnerships routinely insure the lives of the partners, who have no ownership interests in the insurance \npolicies. The policies should bear a face amount equal to each partner’s interest in the partnership and \nshould be adjusted as the fortunes of the partnership change. Proceeds of the insurance policy are used on \ndeath to pay the purchase price of the interest inherited by the deceased’s estate. If the insurance policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n515 \npays out more than the interest at stake, the partnership retains the difference. If the policy pays out less, \nthe partnership agrees to pay the difference in installments. \n \nAnother set of issues arises when the partnership changes because an old partner departs and a new one \njoins. Suppose that Baker leaves the car dealership business and his interest is purchased by Alice, who is \nthen admitted to the partnership. Assume that when Baker left, the business owed Mogul Parts Company \n$5,000 and Laid Back Upholsterers $4,000. After Baker left and Alice joined, Mogul sells another $5,000 \nworth of parts to the firm on credit, and Sizzling Radiator Repair, a new creditor, advances $3,000 worth \nof radiator repair parts. These circumstances pose four questions. \n \nFirst, do creditors of the old partnership remain creditors of the new partnership? Yes. [8] \n \nSecond, does Baker, the old partner, remain liable to the creditors of the old partnership? Yes. [9] That \ncould pose uncomfortable problems for Baker, who may have left the business because he lost interest in \nit and wished to put his money elsewhere. The last thing he wants is the threat of liability hanging over his \nhead when he can no longer profit from the firm’s operations. That is all the more true if he had a falling \nout with his partners and does not trust them. The solution is given in UPA Section 36(2), which says that \nan old partner is discharged from liability if the creditors and the new partnership agree to discharge him. \n \nThird, is Alice, the new partner, liable to creditors of the old partnership? Yes, but only to the extent of her \ncapital contribution. [10] \n \nFourth, is Baker, the old partner, liable for debts incurred after his withdrawal from the partnership? \nSurprisingly, yes, unless Baker takes certain action toward old and new creditors. He must provide actual \nnotice that he has withdrawn to anyone who has extended credit in the past. Once he has done so, he has \nno liability to these creditors for credit extended to the partnership thereafter. Of course, it would be \ndifficult to provide notice to future creditors, since at the time of withdrawal they would not have had a",

The division thereof after adjustments for plaintiff’s \npositive equity or capital resulted in an award to plaintiff for his interest in the business of $53,779.46 \n[about $126,000 in 2011 dollars].… \nPlaintiff also sought exemplary [punitive] damages. Count II of the complaint alleged that defendant’s \nconduct constituted a breach of defendant’s fiduciary duty to his partner under §§ 19-22 of the Uniform \nPartnership Act, and Count III alleged conversion of partnership property. Each count contained \nallegations that defendant’s conduct was willful, wanton and in reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights and \nthat such conduct had caused injury to plaintiff’s feelings, including humiliation, indignity and a sense of \nmoral outrage. The prayer for relief sought exemplary damages therefore. \n \nPlaintiff’s testimony on the point was brief. He said: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n527 \nThe effect of really the whole situation, and I think it was most apparent when I walked into the \nempty building, was extreme disappointment and really total outrage at the fact that something \nthat I had given the utmost of my talent and creativity, energy, and whatever time was necessary \nto build, was totally destroyed and there was just nothing of any value that was left.…My \nbusiness had been stolen and there wasn’t a thing that I could do about it. And to me, that was \nvery humiliating that one day I had something that I had worked 10 years on, and the next day I \nhad absolutely nothing of any value. \n \nAs noted above, the trial judge found that defendant had literally destroyed the partnership by knowingly \nand willfully converting partnership assets in violation of his fiduciary duty as a partner. He also found \nthat plaintiff had suffered a sense of outrage, indignity and humiliation and awarded him $10,000 \n[$23,000 in 2011 dollars] as exemplary damages. \n \nDefendant appeals from that award, asserting that plaintiff’s cause of action arises from a breach of the \npartnership contract and that exemplary damages may not be awarded for breach of that contract.… \n \nIf it were to be assumed that a partner’s breach of his fiduciary duty or appropriation of partnership \nequipment and business contract to his own use and profit are torts, it is clear that the duty breached \narises from the partnership contract. One acquires the property interest of a co-tenant in partnership only \nby the contractual creation of a partnership; one becomes a fiduciary in partnership only by the \ncontractual undertaking to become a partner. There is no tortious conduct here existing independent of \nthe breach of the partnership contract. \n \nNeither do we see anything in the Uniform Partnership Act to suggest that an aggrieved partner is entitled \nto any remedy other than to be made whole economically. The act defines identically the partnership \nfiduciary duty and the remedy for its breach, i.e., to account: \n \nSec. 21. (1) Every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for \nit any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n528 \nconnected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him \nof its property. \n \nSo, the cases involving a partner’s breach of the fiduciary duty to their partners have been concerned \nsolely with placing the wronged partners in the economic position that they would have enjoyed but for \nthe breach. \n \n[Judgment for plaintiff affirmed, as modified with regard to damages.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Lopez \n115 S.W.3d 221 (Texas App. 2003) \n \nHolman, J. \n \nWayne A. Long [plaintiff at the trial court] sued Appellee Sergio Lopez to recover from him, jointly and \nseverally, his portion of a partnership debt that Long had paid. After a bench trial, the trial court ruled \nthat Long take nothing from Appellee. We reverse and render, and remand for calculation of attorney’s \nfees in this suit and pre- and post-judgment interest. \n \nLong testified that in September 1996, Long, Lopez, and Don Bannister entered into an oral partnership \nagreement in which they agreed to be partners in Wood Relo (“the partnership”), a trucking business \nlocated in Gainesville, Texas. Wood Relo located loads for and dispatched approximately twenty trucks it \nleased from owner-operators.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n533 \nThe trial court found that Long, Lopez, and Bannister formed a partnership, Wood Relo, without a written \npartnership agreement. Lopez does not contest these findings. \n \nLong testified that to properly conduct the partnership’s business, he entered into an office equipment \nlease with IKON Capital Corporation (“IKON”) on behalf of the partnership. The lease was a thirty-month \ncontract under which the partnership leased a telephone system, fax machine, and photocopier at a rate of \n$577.91 per month. The lease agreement was between IKON and Wood Relo; the “authorized signer” was \nlisted as Wayne Long, who also signed as personal guarantor. \n \nLong stated that all three partners were authorized to buy equipment for use by the partnership. He \ntestified that the partners had agreed that it was necessary for the partnership to lease the equipment and \nthat on the day the equipment was delivered to Wood Relo’s office, Long was the only partner at the \noffice; therefore, Long was the only one available to sign the lease and personal guaranty that IKON \nrequired. [The partnership disintegrated when Bannister left and he later filed for bankruptcy.]…Long \ntestified that when Bannister left Wood Relo, the partnership still had “quite a few” debts to pay, \nincluding the IKON lease.… \n \nEventually, IKON did repossess all the leased equipment. Long testified that he received a demand letter \nfrom IKON, requesting payment by Wood Relo of overdue lease payments and accelerating payment of \nthe remaining balance of the lease. IKON sought recovery of past due payments in the amount of \n$2,889.55 and accelerated future lease payments in the amount of $11,558.20, for a total of $14,447.75, \nplus interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, with the total exceeding $16,000. Long testified that he advised \nLopez that he had received the demand letter from IKON. \n \nUltimately, IKON filed a lawsuit against Long individually and d/b/a Wood Relo, but did not name Lopez \nor Bannister as parties to the suit. Through his counsel, Long negotiated a settlement with IKON for a \ntotal of $9,000. An agreed judgment was entered in conjunction with the settlement agreement providing \nthat if Long did not pay the settlement, Wood Relo and Long would owe IKON $12,000. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n534 \nAfter settling the IKON lawsuit, Long’s counsel sent a letter to Lopez and Bannister regarding the \nsettlement agreement, advising them that they were jointly and severally liable for the $9,000 that \nextinguished the partnership’s debt to IKON, plus attorney’s fees.… \n \nThe trial court determined that Long was not entitled to reimbursement from Lopez because Long was not \nacting for the partnership when he settled IKON’s claim against the partnership. The court based its \nconclusion on the fact that Long had no “apparent authority with respect to lawsuits” and had not notified \nLopez of the IKON lawsuit. \n \nAnalysis \nTo the extent that a partnership agreement does not otherwise specify, the provisions of the Texas Revised \nPartnership Act govern the relations of the partners and between the partners and the partnership. \n[Citations] Under the Act, each partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the business \nof a partnership.

To that end, Southern Oaks and Horizon entered \ninto several partnership and management contracts in 1993. \n \nIn 1996, Southern Oaks filed suit alleging numerous defaults and breaches of the twenty-year \nagreements.…[T]he trial court found largely in favor of Southern Oaks, concluding that Horizon breached \nits obligations under two different partnership agreements [and that] Horizon had breached several \nmanagement contracts. Thereafter, the court ordered that the partnerships be dissolved, finding that “the \nparties to the various agreements which are the subject of this lawsuit are now incapable of continuing to \noperate in business together” and that because it was dissolving the partnerships, “there is no entitlement \nto future damages.…” In its cross appeal, Southern Oaks asserts that because Horizon unilaterally and \nwrongfully sought dissolution of the partnerships, Southern Oaks should receive a damage award for the \nloss of the partnerships’ seventeen remaining years’ worth of future profits. We reject its argument. \n \nSouthern Oaks argues Horizon wrongfully caused the dissolution because the basis for dissolution cited \nby the court is not one of the grounds for which the parties contracted. The pertinent contracts provided \nin section 7.3 “Causes of Dissolution”: “In addition to the causes for dissolution set forth in Section 7.2(c), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n539 \nthe Partnership shall be dissolved in the event that:…(d) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the \nother Partner, either Partner elects to dissolve the Partnership on account of an Irreconcilable Difference \nwhich arises and cannot, after good faith efforts, be resolved.…” \n \nSouthern Oaks argues that what Horizon relied on at trial as showing irreconcilable differences—the \ndecisions of how profits were to be determined and divided—were not “good faith differences of opinion,” \nnor did they have “a material and adverse impact on the conduct of the Partnerships’ Business.” Horizon’s \nrefusal to pay Southern Oaks according to the terms of the contracts was not an “irreconcilable difference” \nas defined by the contract, Southern Oaks asserts, pointing out that Horizon’s acts were held to be \nbreaches of the contracts. Because there was no contract basis for dissolution, Horizon’s assertion of \ndissolution was wrongful, Southern Oaks concludes. \n \nSouthern Oaks contends further that not only were there no contractual grounds for dissolution, \ndissolution was also wrongful under the Florida Statutes. Southern Oaks argues that pursuant to section \n[of that statute] Horizon had the power to dissociate from the partnership, but, in the absence of contract \ngrounds for the dissociation, Horizon wrongfully dissociated. It asserts that it is entitled to lost future \nprofits under Florida’s partnership law.… \n \nWe find Southern Oaks’ argument without merit. First, the trial court’s finding that the parties are \nincapable of continuing to operate in business together is a finding of “irreconcilable differences,” a \npermissible reason for dissolving the partnerships under the express terms of the partnership agreements. \nThus, dissolution was not “wrongful,” assuming there can be “wrongful” dissolutions, and Southern Oaks \nwas not entitled to damages for lost future profits. Additionally, the partnership contracts also permit \ndissolution by “judicial decree.” Although neither party cites this provision, it appears that pursuant \nthereto, the parties agreed that dissolution would be proper if done by a trial court for whatever reason \nthe court found sufficient to warrant dissolution. \n \nSecond, even assuming the partnership was dissolved for a reason not provided for in the partnership \nagreements, damages were properly denied. Under RUPA, it is clear that wrongful dissociation triggers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n540 \nliability for lost future profits. See [RUPA:] “A partner who wrongfully dissociates is liable to the \npartnership and to the other partners for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition \nto any other obligation of the partner to the partnership or to the other partners.” However, RUPA \ndoes not contain a similar provision for dissolution; RUPA does not refer to the dissolutions as rightful or \nwrongful. [RUPA sets out] “Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership business,” [and] \noutlines the events causing dissolution without any provision for liability for damages.…[RUPA] \nrecognizes judicial dissolution: \n \nA partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only upon the occurrence of any of \nthe following events:… \n \n(5) On application by a partner, a judicial determination that: \n(a) The economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; \n(b) Another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business which makes it \nnot reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with such partner; or",

While “reasonably \npracticable” is not defined in RUPA, the term is broad enough to encompass the inability of partners to \ncontinue working together, which is what the court found. \n \nCertainly the law predating RUPA allowed for recovery of lost profits upon the wrongful dissolution of a \npartnership. See e.g., [Citation]: “A partner who assumes to dissolve the partnership before the end of the \nterm agreed on in the partnership articles is liable, in an action at law against him by his co-partner for \nthe breach of the agreement, to respond in damages for the value of the profits which the plaintiff would \notherwise have received.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n541 \nHowever, RUPA brought significant changes to partnership law, among which was the adoption of the \nterm “dissociation.” Although the term is undefined in RUPA, dissociation appears to have taken the place \nof “dissolution” as that word was used pre-RUPA. “Dissolution” under RUPA has a different meaning, \nalthough the term is undefined in RUPA. It follows that the pre-RUPA cases providing for future damages \nupon wrongful dissolution are no longer applicable to a partnership dissolution. In other words a \n“wrongful dissolution” referred to in the pre-RUPA case law is now, under RUPA, known as “wrongful \ndissociation.” Simply stated, under [RUPA], only when a partner dissociates and the dissociation is \nwrongful can the remaining partners sue for damages. When a partnership is dissolved, RUPA…provides \nthe parameters of liability of the partners upon dissolution.… \n \n[Citation]: “Dissociation is not a condition precedent to dissolution.…Most dissolution events are \ndissociations. On the other hand, it is not necessary to have a dissociation to cause a dissolution and \nwinding up.” \n \nSouthern Oaks’ attempt to bring the instant dissolution under the statute applicable to dissociation is \nrejected. The trial court ordered dissolution of the partnership, not the dissociation of Horizon for \nwrongful conduct. There no longer appears to be “wrongful” dissolution—either dissolution is provided \nfor by contract or statute or the dissolution was improper and the dissolution order should be reversed. In \nthe instant case, because the dissolution either came within the terms of the partnership agreements or \n[RUPA] (judicial dissolution where it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the partnership business), \nSouthern Oaks’ claim for lost future profits is without merit. Affirmed. \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Under RUPA, what is a dissociation? What is a dissolution? \n2. Why did Southern Oaks claim there was no contractual basis for dissolution, notwithstanding the \ndetermination that Horizon had breached the partnership agreement and the management contract? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n542 \n3.

Why didn’t Southern Oaks get what it wanted on this appeal? \n \n \n \n \n12.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nMost of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) rules apply \nonly in the absence of agreement among the partners. Under both, unless the agreement states otherwise, \npartners have certain duties: (1) the duty to serve—that is, to devote themselves to the work of the \npartnership; (2) the duty of loyalty, which is informed by the fiduciary standard: the obligation to act \nalways in the best interest of the partnership and not in one’s own best interest; (3) the duty of care—that \nis, to act as a reasonably prudent partner would; (4) the duty of obedience not to breach any aspect of the \nagreement or act without authority; (5) the duty to inform copartners; and (6) the duty to account to the \npartnership. Ordinarily, partners operate through majority vote, but no act that contravenes the \npartnership agreement itself can be undertaken without unanimous consent. \n \nPartners’ rights include rights (1) to distributions of money, including profits (and losses) as per the \nagreement or equally, indemnification, and return of capital contribution (but not a right to",

Contributions may be in the form of cash, property or services rendered, or a promise \nto render them in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nThe LLC operating agreement may provide for either a member-managed LLC or a manager-managed \n(centralized) LLC. If the former, all members have actual and apparent authority to bind the LLC to \ncontracts on its behalf, as in a partnership, and all members’ votes have equal weight unless otherwise \nagreed. Member-managers have duty of care and a fiduciary duty, though the parameters of those duties \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n559 \nvary from state to state. If the firm is manager managed, only managers have authority to bind the firm; \nthe managers have the duty of care and fiduciary duty, but the nonmanager members usually do not. \nSome states’ statutes provide that voting is based on the financial interests of the members. Most statutes \nprovide that any extraordinary firm decisions be voted on by all members (e.g., amend the agreement, \nadmit new members, sell all the assets prior to dissolution, merge with another entity). Members can \nmake their own rules without the structural requirements (e.g., voting rights, notice, quorum, approval of \nmajor decisions) imposed under state corporate law. \n \nIf the firm has a centralized manager system, it gets a check in its “corporate-like” box, so it will need to \nmake sure there are enough noncorporate-like attributes to make up for this one. If it looks too much like \na corporation, it will be taxed like one. \n \nOne of the real benefits of the LLC as compared with the corporation is that no annual meetings are \nrequired, and no minutes need to be kept. Often, owners of small corporations ignore these formalities to \ntheir peril, but with the LLC there are no worries about such record keeping. \n \nCompensation \nDistributions are allocated among members of an LLC according to the operating agreement; managing \npartners may be paid for their services. Absent an agreement, distributions are allocated among members \nin proportion to the values of contributions made by them or required to be made by them. Upon a \nmember’s dissociation that does not cause dissolution, a dissociating member has the right to distribution \nas provided in the agreement, or—if no agreement—the right to receive the fair value of the member’s \ninterest within a reasonable time after dissociation. No distributions are allowed if making them would \ncause the LLC to become insolvent. \n \nLiability \nThe great accomplishment of the LLC is, again, to achieve limited liability for all its members: no general \npartner hangs out with liability exposure. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n560 \nLiability to Outsiders \nMembers are not liable to third parties for contracts made by the firm or for torts committed in the scope \nof business (but of course a person is always liable for her own torts), regardless of the owner’s level of \nparticipation—unlike a limited partnership, where the general partner is liable. Third parties’ only \nrecourse is as against the firm’s property. See Puleo v. Topel, (see Section 13.4.2 \"Liability Issues in \nLLCs\"), for an analysis of owner liability in an LLC. \n \nInternal Liabilities \nUnless the operating agreement provides otherwise, members and managers of the LLC are generally not \nliable to the firm or its members except for acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, intentional \nmisconduct, or knowing violations of the law. Members and managers, though, must account to the firm \nfor any personal profit or benefit derived from activities not consented to by a majority of disinterested \nmembers or managers from the conduct of the firm’s business or member’s or managers use of firm \nproperty—which is the same as in partnership law. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the LLC is properly formed so that it is not too much like a corporation, it will—upon its \nmembers’ election—be treated like a partnership for tax purposes. \n \nTermination \nTermination, loosely speaking, refers either to how the entity’s life as a business ends (continuity of life) \nor to how a member’s interest in the firm ends—that is, how freely the interest is transferable. \n \nContinuity of Life \nThe first step in the termination of the LLC is dissolution, though dissolution is not necessarily followed \nby termination. \n \nDissolution and Winding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n561 \nThe IRS has determined that continuity of life does not exist “if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, \nretirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization,” [1] and \nthat if one of these events occurs, the entity may continue only with the members’ unanimous consent.",

[2] (Here we see an example of the legislature allowing \nbusiness owners to externalize the risks of business operation.) More broadly, the success of the limited \nliability company attracted the attention of professionals like accountants, lawyers, and doctors who \nsought insulation from personal liability for the mistakes or malpractice of their partners. Their wish was \ngranted with the adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the limited liability \npartnership in the early 1990s. Most partnership law under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act applies \nto LLPs. \n \nCreation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n566 \nMembers of a partnership (only a majority is required) who want to form an LLP must file with the \nsecretary of state; the name of the firm must include “limited liability partnership” or “LLP” to notify the \npublic that its members will not stand personally for the firm’s liabilities. \n \nLiability \nAs noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to afford insulation from liability for its members. A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed limited liability for negligent acts and retained \nunlimited liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts by partners, \nemployees, or agents. The second wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability, leaving only \nbreaches of ordinary contract obligation. These two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. \nThe third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection—no unlimited liability at all. Needless to \nsay, the full-shield type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still, however, many statutes \nrequire specified amounts of professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain fully liable for their \nown negligence or for wrongful acts of those in the LLP whom they supervise. \n \nIn other respects, the LLP is like a partnership. \n \n \nLimited Liability Limited Partnerships \nThe progress toward achieving limited liability continues. A \nlimited liability limited partnership (LLLP, or triple LP) is the latest invention. It is a limited \npartnership that has invoked the LLLP provisions of its state partnership law by filing with a specified \npublic official the appropriate documentation to become an LLLP. This form completely eliminates the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n567 \nautomatic personal liability of the general partner for partnership obligations and, under most statutes, \nalso eliminates the “control rule” liability exposure for all limited partners. It is noteworthy that California \nlaw does not allow for an LLLP to be formed in California; however, it does recognize LLLPs formed in \nother states. A “foreign” LLLP doing business in California must register with the secretary of state. As of \nFebruary 2011, twenty-one states allow the formation of LLLPs. \n \nThe 2001 revision of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) provides this definition of an LLLP: \n“‘Limited liability limited partnership’…means a limited partnership whose certificate of limited \npartnership states that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.” [4] Section 404(c) \ngets to the point: “An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a \nlimited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation \nof the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5]",

Commercial breached \nthe contract, and Plaintiff brought suit against Union Properties and Defendants.

Limited partnerships are a statutory form of business \norganization, and parties creating a limited partnership must follow the statutory requirements. In \nWashington, parties may form a limited partnership with a corporation as the sole general partner. \n[Citations] \n \nPlaintiff’s sole contention is that Defendants should incur general liability for the limited partnership’s \nobligations under RCW 25.08.070, because they exercised the day-to-day control and management of \nCommercial. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Commercial was controlled by Union Properties, a \nseparate legal entity, and not by Defendants in their individual capacities. [RCW 25.08.070 then read: “A \nlimited partner shall not become liable as a general partner unless, in addition to the exercise of his rights \nand powers as limited partner, he takes part in the control of the business.”] \n \n…The pattern of operation of Union Properties was to investigate and conceive of real estate investment \nopportunities and, when it found such opportunities, to cause the creation of limited partnerships with \nUnion Properties acting as the general partner. Commercial was only one of several limited partnerships \nso conceived and created. Defendants did not form Union Properties for the sole purpose of operating \nCommercial. Hence, their acts on behalf of Union Properties were not performed merely for the benefit of \nCommercial.… \n \n[P]etitioner was never led to believe that Defendants were acting in any capacity other than in their \ncorporate capacities. The parties stipulated at the trial that Defendants never acted in any direct, personal \ncapacity. When the shareholders of a corporation, who are also the corporation’s officers and directors, \nconscientiously keep the affairs of the corporation separate from their personal affairs, and no fraud or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n571 \nmanifest injustice is perpetrated upon third persons who deal with the corporation, the corporation’s \nseparate entity should be respected. [Citations] \n \nFor us to find that Defendants incurred general liability for the limited partnership’s obligations under \nRCW 25.08.070 would require us to apply a literal interpretation of the statute and totally ignore the \ncorporate entity of Union Properties, when Plaintiff knew it was dealing with that corporate entity. There \ncan be no doubt that Defendants, in fact, controlled the corporation. However, they did so only in their \ncapacities as agents for their principal, the corporate general partner. Although the corporation was a \nseparate entity, it could act only through its board of directors, officers, and agents. [Citations] Plaintiff \nentered into the contract with Commercial. Defendants signed the contract in their capacities as president \nand secretary-treasurer of Union Properties, the general partner of Commercial. In the eyes of the law it \nwas Union Properties, as a separate corporate entity, which entered into the contract with Plaintiff and \ncontrolled the limited partnership. \nFurther, because Defendants scrupulously separated their actions on behalf of the corporation from their \npersonal actions, Plaintiff never mistakenly assumed that Defendants were general partners with general \nliability.

Know how partnerships and corporations are taxed. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n591 \nLet us assume that three people have already formed a partnership to run a bookstore business. Bob \nhas contributed $80,000. Carol has contributed a house in which the business can lawfully operate. \nTed has contributed his services; he has been managing the bookstore, and the business is showing a \nslight profit. A friend has been telling them that they ought to incorporate. What are the major \nfactors they should consider in reaching a decision? \n \nEase of Formation \nPartnerships are easy to form. If the business is simple enough and the partners are few, the agreement \nneed not even be written down. Creating a corporation is more complicated because formal documents \nmust be placed on file with public authorities. \n \nOwnership and Control \nAll general partners have equal rights in the management and conduct of the business. By contrast, \nownership and control of corporations are, in theory, separated. In the publicly held corporation, \nwhich has many shareholders, the separation is real. Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of \nshares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of \nstock. It is difficult under the best of circumstances for shareholders to exert any form of control over \ncorporate operations. However, in the closely held corporation, which has few shareholders, the \nofficers or senior managers are usually also the shareholders, so the separation of ownership and control \nmay be less pronounced or even nonexistent. \n \nTransferability of Interests \nTransferability of an interest in a partnership is a problem because a transferee cannot become a member \nunless all partners consent. The problem can be addressed and overcome in the partnership \nagreement. Transfer of interest in a corporation, through a sale of stock, is much easier; but for the \nstock of a small corporation, there might not be a market or there might be contractual restrictions on \ntransfer. \n \nFinancing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n592 \nPartners have considerable flexibility in financing. They can lure potential investors by offering interests \nin profits and, in the case of general partnerships, control. Corporations can finance by selling freely \ntransferable stock to the public or by incurring debt. Different approaches to the financing of corporations \nare discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". \n \nTaxation \nThe partnership is a conduit for income and is not taxed as a separate entity. Individual partners are \ntaxed, and although limited by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, they can deduct partnership losses. Corporate \nearnings, on the other hand, are subject to double taxation. The corporation is first taxed on its own \nearnings as an entity. Then, when profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, the \nshareholders are taxed again. (A small corporation, with no more than one hundred shareholders, can \nelect S corporation status. Because S corporations are taxed as partnerships, they avoid double taxation.) \nHowever, incorporating brings several tax benefits. For example, the corporation can take deductions for \nlife, medical, and disability insurance coverage for its employees, whereas partners or sole proprietors \ncannot. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nPartnerships are easier to form than corporations, especially since no documents are required. General \npartners share both ownership and control, but in publicly held corporations, these functions are separated. \nAdditional benefits for a partnership include flexibility in financing, single taxation, and the ability to deduct \nlosses. Transfer of interest in a partnership can be difficult if not addressed in the initial agreement, since all \npartners must consent to the transfer. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Know what rights a corporate “person” and a natural person have in common. \n2. Recognize when a corporate “veil” is pierced and shareholder liability is imposed. \n3. Identify other instances when a shareholder will be held personally liable. \n \nIn comparing partnerships and corporations, there is one additional factor that ordinarily tips the balance \nin favor of incorporating: the corporation is a legal entity in its own right, one that can provide a “veil” \nthat protects its shareholders from personal liability. \n \nFigure 14.1 The Corporate Veil \n \n \nThis crucial factor accounts for the development of much of corporate law. Unlike the individual actor in \nthe legal system, the corporation is difficult to deal with in conventional legal terms. The business of the \nsole proprietor and the sole proprietor herself are one and the same. When a sole proprietor makes a \ndecision, she risks her own capital. When the managers of a corporation take a corporate action, they are \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n594 \nrisking the capital of others—the shareholders. Thus accountability is a major theme in the system of law \nconstructed to cope with legal entities other than natural persons. \n \n \n \nThe Basic Rights of the Corporate “Person” \nTo say that a corporation is a “person” does not automatically describe what its rights are, for the \ncourts have not accorded the corporation every right guaranteed a natural person. Yet the Supreme Court \nrecently affirmed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) that the government may not \nsuppress the First Amendment right of political speech because the speaker is a corporation rather than a \nnatural person. According to the Court, “No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the \npolitical speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” [1] \n \nThe courts have also concluded that corporations are entitled to the essential constitutional protections of \ndue process and equal protection. They are also entitled to Fourth Amendment protection against \nunreasonable search and seizure; in other words, the police must have a search warrant to enter corporate \npremises and look through files. Warrants, however, are not required for highly regulated industries, such \nas those involving liquor or guns. The Double Jeopardy Clause applies to criminal prosecutions of \ncorporations: an acquittal cannot be appealed nor can the case be retried. For purposes of the federal \ncourts’ diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of both the state in which it is \nincorporated and the state in which it has its principal place of business (often, the corporate \n“headquarters”). \n \nUntil relatively recently, few cases had tested the power of the state to limit the right of corporations to \nspend their own funds to speak the “corporate mind.” Most cases involving corporate free speech address \nadvertising, and few states have enacted laws that directly impinge on the freedom of companies to \nadvertise. But those states that have done so have usually sought to limit the ability of corporations to \nsway voters in public referenda. In 1978, the Supreme Court finally confronted the issue head on in First \nNational Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (Section 14.7.1 \"Limiting a Corporation’s First Amendment Rights\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n595 \nThe ruling in Bellotti was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. In Citizens United, the Court struck down the part of the McCain-Feingold Act [2] that \nprohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting \n“electioneering communications.” \nAbsence of Rights \nCorporations lack certain rights that natural persons possess. For example, corporations do not have the \nprivilege against self-incrimination guaranteed for natural persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation. As we explore \nin Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign Corporations, and \nCorporate Dissolution\", corporations are not citizens under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the \nConstitution, so that the states can discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations. And the \ncorporation is not entitled to federal review of state criminal convictions, as are many individuals. \n \nPiercing the Corporate Veil \nGiven the importance of the corporate entity as a veil that limits shareholder liability, it is important to",

The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware.

Bestfoods \n113 F.3d 572 (1998) \n \nSOUTER, JUSTICE \n \nThe United States brought this action under §107(a)(2) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) against, among others, respondent CPC International, \nInc., the parent corporation of the defunct Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II), for the costs of cleaning up industrial \nwaste generated by Ott II’s chemical plant. Section 107(a)(2) authorizes suits against, among others, “any \nperson who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.” The trial \nfocused on whether CPC, as a parent corporation, had “owned or operated” Ott II’s plant within the \nmeaning of §107(a)(2). The District Court said that operator liability may attach to a parent corporation \nboth indirectly, when the corporate veil can be pierced under state law, and directly, when the parent has \nexerted power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in, and exercising control over, the \nsubsidiary’s business during a period of hazardous waste disposal. Applying that test, the court held CPC \nliable because CPC had selected Ott II’s board of directors and populated its executive ranks with CPC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n615 \nofficials, and another CPC official had played a significant role in shaping Ott II’s environmental \ncompliance policy. \nThe Sixth Circuit reversed. Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1. When (but only when) the corporate veil may be pierced, a parent corporation may be charged with \nderivative CERCLA liability for its subsidiary’s actions in operating a polluting facility. It is a general \nprinciple of corporate law that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of \nanother corporation’s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. CERCLA does not purport to reject \nthis bedrock principle, and the Government has indeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as \nan owner or an operator under §107(a)(2) simply because its subsidiary owns or operates a polluting \nfacility. But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary \nrelationship as well as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for \nthe corporation’s conduct when, inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish \ncertain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud, on the shareholder’s behalf. CERCLA does not purport to \nrewrite this well-settled rule, either, and against this venerable common-law backdrop, the congressional \nsilence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U.S. 256, 266-267. \nCERCLA’s failure to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership \ndemands application of the rule that, to abrogate a common-law principle, a statute must speak directly to \nthe question addressed by the common law. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n616 \n \n2. A corporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of its \nsubsidiary’s facility may be held directly liable in its own right under §107(a)(2) as an operator of the \nfacility. \n \n(a) Derivative liability aside, CERCLA does not bar a parent corporation from direct liability for its own \nactions. Under the plain language of §107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly \nliable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even if that person is the parent corporation \nof the facility’s owner. Because the statute does not define the term “operate,” however, it is difficult to \ndefine actions sufficient to constitute direct parental “operation.” In the organizational sense obviously \nintended by CERCLA, to “operate” a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or \nconduct the affairs of the facility.

Review the advantages and disadvantages to the corporation of issuing bonds. \n \n \nBasics of Corporate Bonds \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n634 \nCorporations often raise money through debt. This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration. There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. In \nbankruptcy, the bondholders have a liquidation preference over investors with ownership—that is, the \nshareholders. Additionally, being highly leveraged can be risky: a corporation could load itself up with too \nmuch debt and not be able to make its interest payments or face-value payments. Another major \nconsideration is the “cost” of debt. When interest rates are high, corporations must offer higher interest \nrates to attract investors. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations often raise capital and finance operations through debt. Bank loans are one source of debt, but \nlarge corporations often turn to bonds for financing. Bonds are an IOU, whereby the corporation sells a bond \nto an investor; agrees to make periodic interest payments, such as 5 percent of the face value of the bond \nannually; and at the maturity date, pays the face value of the bond to the investor. There are several \nadvantages to the corporation in using bonds as a financial instrument: the corporation does not give up \nownership in the firm, it attracts more investors, it increases its flexibility, and it can deduct the interest \npayments from corporate taxes. Bonds do have some disadvantages: they are debt and can hurt a highly \nleveraged company, the corporation must pay the interest and principal when they are due, and the \nbondholders have a preference over shareholders upon liquidation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Private equity can be used to finance a company's growth, to buy out a competitor, or to take a company private. Venture capital is a type of investment in which a company or business is owned by a group of investors. Venture capital can be used to finance a company's growth, to buy out a competitor, or to take a company public. There are some similarities and differences between private equity and venture capital. Both are types of investment in which a company or business is owned by a small group of individuals or companies. Both can be used to finance a company's growth, to buy out a competitor, or to take a company private. However, there are some differences. Private equity is usually used to finance a company's growth, while venture capital is usually used to finance a company's start-up or expansion. Private equity is usually used to finance a company's buyout, while venture capital is usually used to finance a company's buyout or expansion."

Surplus is divided into earned surplus (essentially the company’s retained \nearnings) and capital surplus (all surpluses other than earned surplus). We will return to these concepts in \nour discussion of dividends. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n638 \n \nPreferred Stock \nThe term preferred has no set legal meaning, but shareholders of preferred stock often have different \nrights than shareholders of common stock. Holders of preferred stock must look to the articles of \nincorporation to find out what their rights are. Preferred stock has elements of both stock (equity) and \nbonds (debt). Thus corporations issue preferred stock to attract more conservative investors: common \nstock is riskier than preferred stock, so corporations can attract more investors if they have both preferred \nand common stock. \n \nPreference to Dividends \nA dividend is a payment made to stockholders from corporate profits. Assume that one class of preferred \nstock is entitled to a 7 percent dividend. The percentage applies to the par value; if par value is $100, each \nshare of preferred is entitled to a dividend of $7 per year. Assuming the articles of incorporation say so, \nthis 7 percent preferred stock has preference over other classes of shares for dividend payments. \n \nLiquidation Preference \nAn additional right of preferred shareholders is the right to share in the distribution of assets in the event \nof liquidation, after having received assets under a liquidation preference—that is, a preference, according \nto a predetermined formula, to receive the assets of the company on liquidation ahead of other classes of \nshareholders. \n \nConvertible Shares \nWith one exception, the articles of incorporation may grant the right to convert any class of stock into any \nother at the holder’s option according to a fixed ratio. Alternatively, the corporation may force a \nconversion of a shareholder’s convertible stock. Thus if permitted, a preferred shareholder may convert \nhis or her preferred shares into common stock, or vice versa. The exception bars conversion of stock into a \nclass with an asset liquidation preference, although some states permit even that type of so-called \nupstream conversion to a senior security. Convertible preferred shares can be used as a poison pill (a \ncorporate strategy to avoid a hostile takeover): when an outsider seeks to gain control, convertible \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n639 \nshareholders may elect to convert their preferred shares into common stock, thus increasing the number \nof common shares and increasing the number of shares the outsider must purchase in order to gain \ncontrol. \n \nRedeemable Shares \nThe articles of incorporation may provide for the redemption of shares, unless in doing so the corporation \nwould become insolvent. Redemption may be either at an established price and time or by election of the \ncorporation or the shareholder. Redeemed stock is called cancelled stock. Unless the articles of \nincorporation prohibit it, the shares are considered authorized but unissued and can be reissued as the \nneed arises. If the articles of incorporation specifically make the cancellation permanent, then the total \nnumber of authorized shares is reduced, and new shares cannot be reissued without amending the articles \nof incorporation. In this case, the redeemed shares cannot be reissued and must be marked as cancelled \nstock. \n \nVoting Rights \nOrdinarily, the articles of incorporation provide that holders of preferred shares do not have a voting \nright. Or they may provide for contingent voting rights, entitling preferred shareholders to vote on the \nhappening of a particular event—for example, the nonpayment of a certain number of dividends. The \narticles may allow class voting for directors, to ensure that the class of preferred stockholders has some \nrepresentation on the board. \n \nCommon Stock \nCommon stock is different from preferred stock. Common stock represents an ownership interest in a \ncorporation. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, common stockholders have the \nfollowing rights: \n1. Voting rights. This is a key difference: preferred shareholders usually do not have the right to vote. \nCommon shareholders express their ownership interest in the corporation by voting. Votes are cast at \nmeetings, typically the annual meetings, and the shareholders can vote for directors and on other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n640 \nimportant corporate decisions (e.g., there has been a recent push to allow shareholders to vote on \nexecutive compensation). \n2. The right to ratable participation in earnings (i.e., in proportion to the total shares) and/or the right to \nratable participation in the distribution of net assets on liquidation. Bondholders and other creditors \nhave seniority upon liquidation, but if they have been satisfied, or the corporation has no debt, the \ncommon shareholders may ratably recover from what is left over in liquidation.",

Understand what an initial public offering is and under what circumstances one is usually done. \n2. Examine the various requirements of selling stock. \n3. Discuss what adequate and valid consideration is in exchange for stock. \n \n \nSale of stock \nRather than using debt to finance operations, a corporation may instead sell stock. This is most often \naccomplished through an initial public offering (IPO), or the first time a corporation offers stock for \nsale to the public. The sale of securities, such as stock, is governed by the Securities Act of 1933. In \nparticular, Section 5 of the 1933 act governs the specifics of the sale of securities. To return to BCT \nBookstore, Inc., suppose the company wishes to sell stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for \nthe first time. That would be an IPO. The company would partner with securities lawyers and investment \nbanks to accomplish the sale. The banks underwrite the sale of the securities: in exchange for a fee, the \nbank will buy the shares from BCT and then sell them. The company and its team prepare a registration \nstatement, which contains required information about the IPO and is submitted to the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC). The SEC reviews the registration statement and makes the decision \nwhether to permit or prohibit BCT’s IPO. Once the SEC approves the IPO, BCT’s investment banks \npurchase the shares in the primary market and then resell them to investors on the secondary market on \nthe NYSE. (For a further discussion of these two markets, see Chapter 17 \"Securities Regulation\"). Stock \nsales are not limited to an IPO—publicly traded corporations may sell stock several times after going \npublic. The requirements of the 1933 act remain but are loosened for well-known corporations (well-\nknown seasoned issuers). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n644 \nAn IPO or stock sale has several advantages. A corporation may have too much debt and would prefer to \nraise funds through a sale of stock rather than increasing its debt. The total costs of selling stock are often \nlower than financing through debt: the IPO may be expensive, but debt costs can vastly exceed the IPO \ncost because of the interest payments on the debt. Also, IPOs are a popular method of increasing a firm’s \nexposure, bringing the corporation many more investors and increasing its public image. Issuing stock is \nalso beneficial for the corporation because the corporation can use shares as compensation; for example,",

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends \nThe law imposes certain limitations on cash or property dividends a corporation may disburse. Dividends \nmay not be paid if (1) the business is insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they become due), (2) \npaying dividends would make it insolvent, or (3) payment would violate a restriction in the articles of \nincorporation. Most states also restrict the funds available for distribution to those available in earned \nsurplus. Under this rule, a corporation that ran a deficit in the current year could still declare a dividend \nas long as the total earned surplus offset the deficit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n650 \nA few states—significantly, Delaware is one of them—permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current \nearnings and those of the immediately preceding year, both years taken as a single period, even if the \nbalance sheet shows a negative earned surplus. Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified",

Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent. It may revoke a share \ndividend as long as the shares have not been issued. \n \nDiscretion of Directors to Pay Dividends \nWhen Directors Are Too Stingy \nIn every state, dividends are normally payable only at the discretion of the directors. Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders.

One method is to reinvest profits in the \ncorporation. Another method is to use private equity. Private equity involves financing from private \ninvestors, whether individuals (angel investors) or a private equity firm. Venture capital is often used as a \nfundraising mechanism by businesses that are just starting operations. \n \nA third method is to finance through debt, such as a loan or a bond. A corporation sells a bond and agrees \nto make interest payments over the life of the bond and to pay the face value of the bond at the bond’s \nmaturity. \nThe final important method of raising capital is by the sale of stock. The articles of incorporation govern \nthe total number of shares of stock that the corporation may issue, although it need not issue the \nmaximum. Stock in the hands of shareholders is said to be authorized, issued, and outstanding. Stock may \nhave a par value, which is usually the floor price of the stock. No-par shares may be sold for any price set \nby the directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n663 \nPreferred stock (1) may have a dividend preference, (2) takes preference upon liquidation, and (3) may be \nconvertible. Common stock normally has the right to (1) ratable participation in earnings, (2) ratable \nparticipation in the distribution of net assets on liquidation, and (3) ratable vote. \n \nOrdinarily, the good-faith judgment of the directors concerning the fair value of the consideration \nreceived for stock is determinative. A minority of states adhere to a true value rule that holds to an \nobjective standard. \n \nA corporation that sells shares for the first time engages in an initial public offering (IPO). The Securities \nAct of 1933 governs most IPOs and initial stock sales. A corporation that has previously issued stock may \ndo so many times afterward, depending on the corporation’s needs. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \ngoverns most secondary market stock sales. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 adds another layer of \nregulation to the financial transactions discussed in this chapter. \n \nA dividend is a share of a corporation’s profits. Dividends may be distributed as cash, property, or stock. \nThe law imposes certain limitations on the amount that the corporation may disburse; most states restrict \nthe cash or property available for distribution to earned surplus. However, a few states, including \nDelaware, permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current earnings and those of the immediately \npreceding year, both years taken as a single period; these are known as nimble dividends.

In Chapter 17 \"Securities \nRegulation\", we will continue discussion of officers’ and directors’ liability within the context of \nsecurities regulation and insider trading. \n \n \n \n16.1 Powers of a Corporation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the two types of corporate power. \n2. Consider the ramifications when a corporation acts outside its prescribed powers. \n3. Review legal issues surrounding corporate actions. \n \n \n \nTwo Types of Corporate Powers \nA corporation generally has three parties sharing power and control: directors, officers, and shareholders. \nDirectors are the managers of the corporation, and officers control the day-to-day decisions and work \nmore closely with the employees. The shareholders are the owners of the corporation, but they have little \ndecision-making authority. The corporation itself has powers; while a corporation is not the same as a \nperson (e.g., a corporation cannot be put in prison), it is allowed to conduct certain activities and has been \ngranted certain rights. \n \nExpress Powers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n668 \nThe corporation may exercise all powers expressly given it by statute and by its articles of incorporation. \nSection 3.02 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) sets out a number \nof express powers, including the following: to sue and be sued in the corporate name; to purchase, use, \nand sell land and dispose of assets to the same extent a natural person can; to make contracts, borrow \nmoney, issue notes and bonds, lend money, invest funds, make donations to the public welfare, and \nestablish pension plans; and to join in partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, or other enterprises. The \npowers set out in this section need not be included in the articles of incorporation. \n \nImplied Powers \nCorporate powers beyond those explicitly established are implied powers. For example, suppose BCT \nBookstore, Inc.’s statement of purpose reads simply, “to operate a bookstore.” The company may lawfully \nconduct all acts that are necessary or appropriate to running a bookstore—hiring employees, advertising \nspecial sales, leasing trucks, and so forth. Could Ted, its vice president and general manager, authorize the \nexpenditure of funds to pay for a Sunday afternoon lecture on the perils of nuclear war or the adventures \nof a professional football player? Yes—if the lectures are relevant to current books on sale or serve to bring \npeople into the store, they comply with the corporation’s purpose. \n \n \nThe Ultra Vires Doctrine \nThe law places limitations upon what acts a corporation may undertake. Corporations cannot do anything \nthey wish, but rather, must act within the prescribed rules as laid out in statute, case law, their articles of \nincorporation, and their bylaws. Sometimes, though, a corporation will step outside its permitted power \n(literally “beyond the powers). The ultra vires doctrine holds that certain legal consequences attach to \nan attempt by a corporation to carry out acts that are outside its lawful powers. Ultra vires (literally \n“beyond the powers”) is not limited to illegal acts, although it encompasses actions barred by statute as \nwell as by the corporate charter. Under the traditional approach, either the corporation or the other party \ncould assert ultra vires as a defense when refusing to abide by a wholly executory contract. The ultra vires \ndoctrine loses much of its significance when corporate powers are broadly stated in a corporation’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n669 \narticles. Furthermore, RMBCA Section 3.04 states that “the validity of corporate action may not be \nchallenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.” \n \nNonetheless, ultra vires acts are still challenged in courts today. For example, particularly in the area of \nenvironmental law, plaintiffs are challenging corporate environmental actions as ultra vires. Delaware \ncorporation law states that the attorney general shall revoke the charter of a corporation for illegal acts. \nAdditionally, the Court of Chancery of Delaware has jurisdiction to forfeit or revoke a corporate charter \nfor abuse of corporate powers. [1] See Adam Sulkowski’s “Ultra Vires Statutes: Alive, Kicking, and a Means \nof Circumventing the Scalia Standing Gauntlet.” [2] \n \nIn essence, ultra vires retains force in three circumstances: \n \n1. Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3. The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670",

What \nhappens if this action is ultra vires? Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. (see Section 16.5.1 \"Ultra Vires \nActs\"), focuses on this issue. An ultra vires act is not necessarily criminal or tortious. However, every \ncrime and tort is in some sense ultra vires because a corporation never has legal authority to commit \ncrimes or torts. They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent. An additional dilemma was that society could not \nliterally imprison a corporation. Modern law is not so constricting. Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions. But these \ncases are extremely rare. \n \nThat a corporation is found guilty of a violation of the law does not excuse company officials who \nauthorized or carried out the illegal act. They, too, can be prosecuted and sent to jail. Legal punishments \nare being routinely added to the newer regulatory statutes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and the Toxic Substances Control Act—although prosecution depends mainly on whether and where a \nparticular administration wishes to spend its enforcement dollars. Additionally, state prosecuting \nattorneys have become more active in filing criminal charges against management when employees are \ninjured or die on the job. For instance, a trial court judge in Chicago sentenced a company president, \nplant manager, and foreman to twenty-five years in prison after they were convicted of murder following \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n671 \nthe death of a worker as a result of unsafe working conditions at a plant; [3] the punishments were later \noverturned, but the three pled guilty several years later and served shorter sentences of varying duration. \n \nMore recently, prosecutors have been expanding their prosecutions of corporations and developing \nmethodologies to evaluate whether a corporation has committed a criminal act; for example, US Deputy \nAttorney General Paul McNulty revised “Principles of Federal Prosecutions of Business Organizations” in \n2006 to further guide prosecutors in indicting corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\"). [4] This stands in contrast to the general rule that an individual must \nknow, or should know, of a violation of the law in order to be liable. Strict liability does not require",

Shareholders may take actions without a meeting if \nevery shareholder entitled to vote consents in writing to the action to be taken. This option is obviously \nuseful to the closely held corporation but not to the giant publicly held companies. \n \nRight to Vote \nWho Has the Right to Vote? \nThrough its bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors, a corporation can set a “record date.” Only \nthe shareholders listed on the corporate records on that date receive notice of the next shareholders’ \nmeeting and have the right to vote. Every share is entitled to one vote unless the articles of incorporation \nstate otherwise. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n674 \n \nThe one-share, one-vote principle, commonly called regular voting or statutory voting, is not required, \nand many US companies have restructured their voting rights in an effort to repel corporate raiders. For \ninstance, a company might decide to issue both voting and nonvoting shares (as we discussed in Chapter \n16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"), with the voting shares going to insiders who thereby control \nthe corporation. In response to these new corporate structures, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) adopted a one-share, one-vote rule in 1988 that was designed to protect a shareholder’s right to \nvote. In 1990, however, a federal appeals court overturned the SEC rule on the grounds that voting rights \nare governed by state law rather than by federal law. [1] \n \nQuorum \nWhen the articles of incorporation are silent, a shareholder quorum is a simple majority of the shares \nentitled to vote, whether represented in person or by proxy, according to RMBCA Section 7.25. Thus if \nthere are 1 million shares, 500,001 must be represented at the shareholder meeting. A simple majority of \nthose represented shares is sufficient to carry any motion, so 250,001 shares are enough to decide upon a \nmatter other than the election of directors (governed by RMBCA, Section 7.28). The articles of \nincorporation may decree a different quorum but not less than one-third of the total shares entitled to \nvote. \n \nCumulative Voting \nCumulative voting means that a shareholder may distribute his total votes in any manner that he \nchooses—all for one candidate or several shares for different candidates. With cumulative voting, each \nshareholder has a total number of votes equal to the number of shares he owns multiplied by the number \nof directors to be elected. Thus if a shareholder has 1,000 shares and there are five directors to be elected, \nthe shareholder has 5,000 votes, and he may vote those shares in a manner he desires (all for one \ndirector, or 2,500 each for two directors, etc.). Some states permit this right unless the articles of \nincorporation deny it. Other states deny it unless the articles of incorporation permit it. Several states \nhave constitutional provisions requiring cumulative voting for corporate directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n675 \nCumulative voting is meant to provide minority shareholders with representation on the board. Assume \nthat Bob and Carol each owns 2,000 shares, which they have decided to vote as a block, and Ted owns \n6,000 shares. At their annual shareholder meeting, they are to elect five directors. Without cumulative \nvoting, Ted’s slate of directors would win: under statutory voting, each share represents one vote available \nfor each director position. With this method, by placing as many votes as possible for each director, Ted \ncould cast 6,000 votes for each of his desired directors. Thus each of Ted’s directors would receive 6,000 \nvotes, while each of Bob and Carol’s directors would receive only 4,000. Under cumulative voting, \nhowever, each shareholder has as many votes as there are directors to be elected. Hence with cumulative \nvoting Bob and Carol could strategically distribute their 20,000 votes (4,000 votes multiplied by five \ndirectors) among the candidates to ensure representation on the board. By placing 10,000 votes each on \ntwo of their candidates, they would be guaranteed two positions on the board. (The candidates from the \ntwo slates are not matched against each other on a one-to-one basis; instead, the five candidates with the \nhighest number of votes are elected.) Various formulas and computer programs are available to determine \nhow votes should be allocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting is \ndemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock—Bob and Carol—to elect 40 \npercent of the board. \n \nRMBCA Section 8.08 provides a safeguard against attempts to remove directors.

Proxies are usually solicited by and given to \nmanagement, either to vote for proposals or people named in the proxy or to vote however the proxy \nholder wishes. Through the proxy device, management of large companies can maintain control over the \nelection of directors. Proxies must be signed by the shareholder and are valid for eleven months from the \ntime they are received by the corporation unless the proxy explicitly states otherwise. Management may \nuse reasonable corporate funds to solicit proxies if corporate policy issues are involved, but \nmisrepresentations in the solicitation can lead a court to nullify the proxies and to deny reimbursement \nfor the solicitation cost. Only the last proxy given by a particular shareholder can be counted. \n \nProxy solicitations are regulated by the SEC. For instance, SEC rules require companies subject to the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to file proxy materials with the SEC at least ten days before proxies are \nmailed to shareholders. Proxy statements must disclose all material facts, and companies must use a \nproxy form on which shareholders can indicate whether they approve or disapprove of the proposals. \n \nDissident groups opposed to management’s position are entitled to solicit their own proxies at their own \nexpense. The company must either furnish the dissidents with a list of all shareholders and addresses or \nmail the proxies at corporate expense. Since management usually prefers to keep the shareholder list \nprivate, dissidents can frequently count on the corporation to foot the mailing bill. \n \nVoting Agreements \nUnless they intend to commit fraud on a minority of stockholders, shareholders may agree in advance to \nvote in specific ways. Such a voting agreement, often called a shareholder agreement, is generally legal. \nShareholders may agree in advance, for example, to vote for specific directors; they can even agree to vote \nfor the dissolution of the corporation in the event that a predetermined contingency occurs. A voting \nagreement is easier to enter into than a voting trust (discussed next) and can be less expensive, since a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n677 \ntrustee is not paid to administer a voting agreement. A voting agreement also permits shareholders to \nretain their shares rather than turning the shares over to a trust, as would be required in a voting trust. \n \nVoting Trusts \nTo ensure that shareholder agreements will be honored, shareholders in most states can create \na voting trust. By this device, voting shares are given to voting trustees, who are empowered to vote the \nshares in accordance with the objectives set out in the trust agreement. Section 7.30 of the RMBCA limits \nthe duration of voting trusts to ten years. The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust. The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting",

Examine the responsibility of directors and the delegation of decisions. \n2. Discuss the qualifications, election, and removal of directors. \n3. Determine what requirements are placed on directors for meetings and compensation. \n \n \nGeneral Management Responsibility of the Directors \nDirectors derive their power to manage the corporation from statutory law. Section 8.01 of the Revised \nModel Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) states that “all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under \nthe authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of, its board \nof directors.” A director is a fiduciary, a person to whom power is entrusted for another’s benefit, and as \nsuch, as the RMBCA puts it, must perform his duties “in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent \nperson in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances” (Section 8.30). A director’s main \nresponsibilities include the following: (1) to protect shareholder investments, (2) to select and remove \nofficers, (3) to delegate operating authority to the managers or other groups, and (4) to supervise the \ncompany as a whole. \n \n \n \nDelegation to Committees \nUnder RMBCA Section 8.25, the board of directors, by majority vote, may delegate its powers to various \ncommittees. This authority is limited to some degree. For example, only the full board can determine \ndividends, approve a merger, and amend the bylaws. The delegation of authority to a committee does not, \nby itself, relieve a director from the duty to exercise due care. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n681 \nDelegation to Officers \n \nFigure 16.2 The Corporate Governance Model \n \n \nThe directors often delegate to officers the day-to-day authority to execute the policies established by the \nboard and to manage the firm (see Figure 16.2 \"The Corporate Governance Model\"). Normally, the \npresident is the chief executive officer (CEO) to whom all other officers and employees report, but \nsometimes the CEO is also the chairman of the board. \n \nNumber and Election of Directors \nSection 8.03 of the RMBCA provides that there must be one director, but there may be more, the precise \nnumber to be fixed in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors. In that case, if the articles of incorporation \nso provide, the board may be divided into two or three roughly equal classes and their terms staggered, so \nthat the second class is elected at the second annual meeting and the third at the third annual meeting.

            "chunk": "Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) impose on him a stringent duty of disclosure. In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the \ncorporation. The rule encompasses the chance of acquiring another corporation, purchasing property, and \nlicensing or marketing patents or products. This duty of disclosure was placed into legal lexicon by Judge \nCardozo in 1928 when he stated that business partners owe more than a general sense of honor among \none another; rather, they owe “the punctilio of honor most sensitive.” [3] Thus when a corporate \nopportunity arises, business partners must disclose the opportunity, and a failure to disclose is \ndishonest—a breach of the duty of loyalty. \n \nWhether a particular opportunity is a corporate opportunity can be a delicate question. For example, BCT \nowns a golf course and a country club. A parcel of land adjacent to their course comes on the market for \nsale, but BCT takes no action. Two BCT officers purchase the land personally, later informing the BCT \nboard about the purchase and receiving board ratification of their purchase. Then BCT decides to \nliquidate and enters into an agreement with the two officers to sell both parcels of land. A BCT \nshareholder brings a derivative suit against the officers, alleging that purchasing the adjacent land stole a \ncorporate opportunity. The shareholder would be successful in his suit. In considering Farber v. Servan \nLand Co., Inc., [4] a case just like the one described, the Farber court laid out four factors in considering \nwhether a corporate opportunity has been usurped: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n687 \n1. Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand. Put another way, a director must make a reasonable \neffort to inform himself before making a decision, as discussed in the next paragraph. The director is not \nheld to a higher standard required of a specialist (finance, marketing) unless he is one. A director of a \nsmall, closely held corporation will not necessarily be held to the same standard as a director who is given \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n688 \na staff by a large, complex, diversified company. The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations",

What kind of care would an ordinarily prudent person in any situation be required \nto give? Unlike the standard of care, which can differ, the care itself has certain requirements. At a \nminimum, the director must pay attention. He must attend meetings, receive and digest information \nadequate to inform him about matters requiring board action, and monitor the performance of those to \nwhom he has delegated the task of operating the corporation. Of course, documents can be misleading, \nreports can be slanted, and information coming from self-interested management can be distorted. To \nwhat heights must suspicion be raised? Section 8.30 of the RMBCA forgives directors the necessity of \nplaying detective whenever information, including financial data, is received in an apparently reliable \nmanner from corporate officers or employees or from experts such as attorneys and public accountants. \nThus the director does not need to check with another attorney once he has received financial data from \none competent attorney. \n \nA New Jersey Supreme Court decision considered the requirements of fiduciary duties, particularly the \nduty of care. Pritchard & Baird was a reissuance corporation owned by Pritchard and having four \ndirectors: Pritchard, his wife, and his two sons. Pritchard and his sons routinely took loans from the \naccounts of the firm’s clients. After Pritchard died, his sons increased their borrowing, eventually sending \nthe business into bankruptcy. During this time, Mrs. Pritchard developed a fondness for alcohol, drinking \nheavily and paying little attention to her directorship responsibilities. Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation. The court found that Mrs. Pritchard’s being on the board because she \nwas the spouse was insufficient to excuse her behavior, and that had she been performing her duties, she \ncould have prevented the bankruptcy. [6] \n \nDespite the fiduciary requirements, in reality a director does not spend all his time on corporate affairs, is \nnot omnipotent, and must be permitted to rely on the word of others. Nor can directors be infallible in \nmaking decisions. Managers work in a business environment, in which risk is a substantial factor. No \ndecision, no matter how rigorously debated, is guaranteed. Accordingly, courts will not second-guess \ndecisions made on the basis of good-faith judgment and due care. This is the business judgment rule, \nmentioned in previous chapters. The business judgment rule was coming into prominence as early as 1919 \nin Dodge v. Ford, discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". It has been a pillar of \ncorporate law ever since. As described by the Delaware Supreme Court: “The business judgment rule is an \nacknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of Delaware directors.…It is a presumption that in \nmaking a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in \nthe honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” [7] \n \nUnder the business judgment rule, the actions of directors who fulfill their fiduciary duties will not be \nsecond-guessed by a court. The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to",

While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in \nthe context of mergers, acquisitions, and tender offers. As mentioned previously in the Revlon case, the \nduty owed to shareholders in situations of competing tender offers is that of maximum value. Other duties \nmay arise, such as when directors attempt to retain their positions on the board in the face of a hostile \ntender offer. Trends in fiduciary responsibilities, as well as other changes in the business legal field, are \ncovered extensively by the American Bar Association \nat http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html. \n \nLiability Prevention and Insurance \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n695 \nAlice, the director of BCT, has been charged with breaching her duty of care. Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law.

The conduct that is the subject of due care \nmay overlap with the conduct that comes within the rubric of good faith in a psychological sense, but from \na legal standpoint those duties are and must remain quite distinct.… \n \nThe Delaware General Assembly has addressed the distinction between bad faith and a failure to exercise \ndue care (i.e., gross negligence) in two separate contexts. The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del. C. § 145. To \noversimplify, subsections (a) and (b) of that statute permit a corporation to indemnify (inter alia) any \nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses…where \n(among other things): (i) that person is, was, or is threatened to be made a party to that action, suit or \nproceeding, and (ii) that person “acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be \nin or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.…” Thus, under Delaware statutory law a \ndirector or officer of a corporation can be indemnified for liability (and litigation expenses) incurred by \nreason of a violation of the duty of care, but not for a violation of the duty to act in good faith. \n \nSection 145, like Section 102(b)(7), evidences the intent of the Delaware General Assembly to afford \nsignificant protections to directors (and, in the case of Section 145, other fiduciaries) of Delaware \ncorporations. To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith. In our view it must be, for at least two reasons. \n \nFirst, the universe of fiduciary misconduct is not limited to either disloyalty in the classic sense (i.e., \npreferring the adverse self-interest of the fiduciary or of a related person to the interest of the \ncorporation) or gross negligence. Cases have arisen where corporate directors have no conflicting self-\ninterest in a decision, yet engage in misconduct that is more culpable than simple inattention or failure to \nbe informed of all facts material to the decision. To protect the interests of the corporation and its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n707 \nshareholders, fiduciary conduct of this kind, which does not involve disloyalty (as traditionally defined) \nbut is qualitatively more culpable than gross negligence, should be proscribed. A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. A failure to act in good faith may be",

It is an independent regulatory agency, subject to the \nrules of the Administrative Procedure Act (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The commission is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n716 \ncomposed of five members, who have staggered five-year terms. Every June 5, the term of one of the \ncommissioners expires. Although the president cannot remove commissioners during their terms of \noffice, he does have the power to designate the chairman from among the sitting members. The SEC is \nbipartisan: not more than three commissioners may be from the same political party. \n \nThe SEC’s primary task is to investigate complaints or other possible violations of the law in securities \ntransactions and to bring enforcement proceedings when it believes that violations have occurred. It is \nempowered to conduct information inquiries, interview witnesses, examine brokerage records, and review \ntrading data. If its requests are refused, it can issue subpoenas and seek compliance in federal court. Its \nusual leads come from complaints of investors and the general public, but it has authority to conduct \nsurprise inspections of the books and records of brokers and dealers. Another source of leads is price \nfluctuations that seem to have been caused by manipulation rather than regular market forces. \n \nAmong the violations the commission searches out are these: (1) unregistered sale of securities subject to \nthe registration requirement of the Securities Act of 1933, (2) fraudulent acts and practices, (3) \nmanipulation of market prices, (4) carrying out of a securities business while insolvent, (5) \nmisappropriation of customers’ funds by brokers and dealers, and (4) other unfair dealings by brokers \nand dealers. \n \nWhen the commission believes that a violation has occurred, it can take one of three courses. First, it can \nrefer the case to the Justice Department with a recommendation for criminal prosecution in cases of \nfraud or other willful violation of law. \n \nSecond, the SEC can seek a civil injunction in federal court against further violations. As a result of \namendments to the securities laws in 1990 (the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock \nReform Act), the commission can also ask the court to impose civil penalties. The maximum penalty is \n$100,000 for each violation by a natural person and $500,000 for each violation by an entity other than a \nnatural person. Alternatively, the defendant is liable for the gain that resulted from violating securities law \nif the gain exceeds the statutory penalty. The court is also authorized to bar an individual who has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n717 \ncommitted securities fraud from serving as an officer or a director of a company registered under the \nsecurities law. \n \nThird, the SEC can proceed administratively—that is, hold its own hearing, with the usual due process \nrights, before an administrative law judge. If the commissioners by majority vote accept the findings \nof the administrative law judge after reading briefs and hearing oral argument, they can impose a variety \nof sanctions: suspend or expel members of exchanges; deny, suspend, or revoke the registrations of \nbroker-dealers; censure individuals for misconduct; and bar censured individuals (temporarily or \npermanently) from employment with a registered firm. The 1990 securities law amendments allow the \nSEC to impose civil fines similar to the court-imposed fines described. The amendments also authorize \nthe SEC to order individuals to cease and desist from violating securities law. \n \nFundamental Mission \nThe SEC’s fundamental mission is to ensure adequate disclosure in order to facilitate informed \ninvestment decisions by the public. However, whether a particular security offering is worthwhile or \nworthless is a decision for the public, not for the SEC, which has no legal authority to pass on the merits of \nan offering or to bar the sale of securities if proper disclosures are made. \n \nOne example of SEC’s regulatory mandate with respect to disclosures involved the 1981 sale of $274 \nmillion in limited partnership interests in a company called Petrogene Oil & Gas Associates, New York. \nThe Petrogene offering was designed as a tax shelter. The company’s filing with the SEC stated that the \noffering involved “a high degree of risk” and that only those “who can afford the complete loss of their \ninvestment” should contemplate investing. Other disclosures included one member of the controlling \ngroup having spent four months in prison for conspiracy to commit securities fraud; that he and another \nprincipal were the subject of a New Mexico cease and desist order involving allegedly unregistered tax-\nsheltered securities; that the general partner, brother-in-law of one of the principals, had no experience in",

Today, every state has enacted a blue sky law, so called because its purpose is to \nprevent “speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of ‘blue sky.’” [3] The federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n722 \nSecurities Act of 1933, discussed in Section 17.1.3 \"Securities Act of 1933\", specifically preserves the \njurisdiction of states over securities. \nBlue sky laws are divided into three basic types of regulation. The simplest is that which prohibits fraud in \nthe sale of securities. Thus at a minimum, issuers cannot mislead investors about the purpose of the \ninvestment. All blue sky laws have antifraud provisions; some have no other provisions. The second type \ncalls for registration of broker-dealers, and the third type for registration of securities. Some state laws \nparallel the federal laws in intent and form of proceeding, so that they overlap; other blue sky laws \nempower state officials (unlike the SEC) to judge the merits of the offerings, often referred to as \nmerit review laws. As part of a movement toward deregulation, several states have recently modified or \neliminated merit provisions. \n \nMany of the blue sky laws are inconsistent with each other, making national uniformity difficult. In 1956, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Securities Act. \nIt has not been designed to reconcile the conflicting philosophies of state regulation but to take them into \naccount and to make the various forms of regulation as consistent as possible. States adopt various \nportions of the law, depending on their regulatory philosophies. The Uniform Securities Act has antifraud, \nbroker-dealer registration, and securities registration provisions. More recent acts have further increased \nuniformity. These include the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which preempted \ndiffering state philosophies with regard to registration of securities and regulation of brokers and \nadvisors, and the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which preempted state law \nsecurities fraud claims from being raised in class action lawsuits by investors. \n \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich is the largest amendment to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. \nThis amendment was enacted in response to the economic recession of the late 2000s for the following \npurposes: (1) to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and \ntransparency in the financial system, (2) to end “too big to fail” institutions, (3) to protect the American \ntaxpayer by ending bailouts, and (4) to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n723 \ninstitutions most affected by the regulatory changes include those involved in monitoring the financial \nsystem, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the SEC. Importantly, the \namendment ended the exemption for investment advisors who previously were not required to register \nwith the SEC because they had fewer than fifteen clients during the previous twelve months and did not \nhold out to the public as investment advisors. This means that in practice, numerous investment advisors, \nas well as hedge funds and private equity firms, are now subject to registration requirements.

It is not limited to securities \nregistered under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. It is not limited to publicly held companies. It applies \nto any security issued by any company, including the smallest closely held company. In substance, it is an \nantifraud rule, enforcement of which seems, on its face, to be limited to action by the SEC. But over the \nyears, the courts have permitted people injured by those who violate the statute to file private damage \nsuits. This sweeping rule has at times been referred to as the “federal law of corporations” or the “catch \neverybody” rule. \n \nInsider trading ran headlong into Rule 10b-5 beginning in 1964 in a series of cases involving Texas Gulf \nSulphur Company (TGS). On November 12, 1963, the company discovered a rich deposit of copper and \nzinc while drilling for oil near Timmins, Ontario. Keeping the discovery quiet, it proceeded to acquire \nmineral rights in adjacent lands. By April 1964, word began to circulate about TGS’s find. \n \nNewspapers printed rumors, and the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced a wild speculative spree. On \nApril 12, an executive vice president of TGS issued a press release downplaying the discovery, asserting \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n728 \nthat the rumors greatly exaggerated the find and stating that more drilling would be necessary before \ncoming to any conclusions. Four days later, on April 16, TGS publicly announced that it had uncovered a \nstrike of 25 million tons of ore. In the months following this announcement, TGS stock doubled in value. \n \nThe SEC charged several TGS officers and directors with having purchased or told their friends, so-\ncalled tippees, to purchase TGS stock from November 12, 1963, through April 16, 1964, on the basis of \nmaterial inside information. The SEC also alleged that the April 12, 1964, press release was deceptive. The \nUS Court of Appeals, in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., [2] decided that the defendants who purchased the \nstock before the public announcement had violated Rule 10b-5. According to the court, “anyone in \npossession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is \ndisabled from disclosing to protect a corporate confidence, or he chooses not to do so, must abstain from \ntrading in or recommending the securities concerned while such inside information remains undisclosed.” \nOn remand, the district court ordered certain defendants to pay $148,000 into an escrow account to be \nused to compensate parties injured by the insider trading. \n \nThe court of appeals also concluded that the press release violated Rule 10b-5 if “misleading to the \nreasonable investor.” On remand, the district court held that TGS failed to exercise “due diligence” in \nissuing the release. Sixty-nine private damage actions were subsequently filed against TGS by \nshareholders who claimed they sold their stock in reliance on the release. The company settled most of \nthese suits in late 1971 for $2.7 million. \n \nFollowing the TGS episode, the Supreme Court refined Rule 10b-5 on several fronts. First, in Ernst & \nErnst v. Hochfelder, [3] the Court decided that proof of scienter—defined as “mental state embracing \nintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”—is required in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In \nother words, negligence alone will not result in Rule 10b-5 liability. The Court also held that scienter, \nwhich is an intentional act, must be established in SEC injunctive actions. [4] \n \nThe Supreme Court has placed limitations on the liability of tippees under Rule 10b-5. In 1980, the Court \nreversed the conviction of an employee of a company that printed tender offer and merger prospectuses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n729 \nUsing information obtained at work, the employee had purchased stock in target companies and later sold \nit for a profit when takeover attempts were publicly announced. In Chiarella v. United States, the Court \nheld that the employee was not an insider or a fiduciary and that “a duty to disclose under Section 10(b) \ndoes not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.” [5] Following Chiarella, the \nCourt ruled in Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission (see Section 17.3.2 \"Tippee Liability\"), that \ntippees are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing \nconfidential information and the tipper received a personal benefit from the disclosure. \n \nThe Supreme Court has also refined Rule 10b-5 as it relates to the duty of a company to \ndisclose material information, as discussed in Basic, Inc. v.

Levinson (see Section 17.3.3 \"Duty to \nDisclose Material Information\"). This case is also important in its discussion of the degree of reliance \ninvestors must prove to support a Rule 10b-5 action. \nIn 2000, the SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1, which defines trading “on the basis of” inside information as any \ntime a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. Therefore, a defendant is not saved \nby arguing that the trade was made independent of knowledge of the nonpublic information. However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v. O’Hagan, [7] and the SEC adopted the theory as \nnew Rule 10b5-2. Under this new rule, the duty of trust or confidence exists when (1) a person agrees to \nmaintain information in confidence; (2) the recipient knows or should have known through history, \npattern, or practice of sharing confidences that the person communicating the information expects \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n730 \nconfidentiality; and (3) a person received material nonpublic information from his or her spouse, parent, \nchild, or sibling. \n \nIn 1987, in Carpenter v. United States, [8] the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of a Wall Street \nJournal reporter who leaked advanced information about the contents of his “Heard on the Street” \ncolumn. The reporter, who was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, had been convicted on both mail \nand wire fraud and securities law charges for misappropriating information. The Court upheld the mail \nand wire fraud conviction by an 8–0 vote and the securities law conviction by a 4–4 vote. (In effect, the tie \nvote affirmed the conviction.) [9] \n \nBeyond these judge-made theories of liability, Congress had been concerned about insider trading, and in \n1984 and 1988, it substantially increased the penalties. A person convicted of insider trading now faces a \nmaximum criminal fine of $1 million and a possible ten-year prison term. A civil penalty of up to three \ntimes the profit made (or loss avoided) by insider trading can also be imposed. This penalty is in addition \nto liability for profits made through insider trading. For example, financier Ivan Boesky, who was \nsentenced in 1987 to a three-year prison term for insider trading, was required to disgorge $50 million of \nprofits and was liable for another $50 million as a civil penalty. In 2003, Martha Stewart was indicted on \ncharges of insider trading but was convicted for obstruction of justice, serving only five months. More \nrecently, in 2009, billionaire founder of the Galleon Group, Raj Rajaratnam, was arrested for insider \ntrading; he was convicted in May 2011 of all 14 counts of insider trading. For the SEC release on the \nMartha Stewart case, seehttp://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-69.htm. \n \nCompanies that knowingly and recklessly fail to prevent insider trading by their employees are subject to \na civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided by insider trading or $1 million, \nwhichever is greater. Corporations are also subject to a criminal fine of up to $2.5 million. \n \nSecondary Actor \nIn Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, [10] the US Supreme Court held that “aiders and \nabettors” of fraud cannot be held secondarily liable under 10(b) for a private cause of action. This means \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n731 \nthat secondary actors, such as lawyers and accountants, cannot be held liable unless their conduct \nsatisfies all the elements for 10(b) liability. \nFor an overview of insider trading, go to http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm.",

Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d, at 849. \n \n* * * \n \nWhether merger discussions in any particular case are material therefore depends on the facts. Generally, \nin order to assess the probability that the event will occur, a factfinder will need to look to indicia of \ninterest in the transactions at the highest corporate levels. Without attempting to catalog all such possible \nfactors, we note by way of example that board resolutions, instructions to investment bankers, and actual \nnegotiations between principals or their intermediaries may serve as indicia of interest. To assess the \nmagnitude of the transaction to the issuer of the securities allegedly manipulated, a factfinder will need to \nconsider such facts as the size of the two corporate entities and of the potential premiums over market \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n739 \nvalue. No particular event or factor short of closing the transaction need to be either necessary or \nsufficient by itself to render merger discussions material. \n \nAs we clarify today, materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the \nwithheld or misrepresented information. The fact-specific inquiry we endorse here is consistent with the \napproach a number of courts have taken in assessing the materiality of merger negotiations. Because the \nstandard of materiality we have adopted differs from that used by both courts below, we remand the case \nfor reconsideration of the question whether a grant of summary judgment is appropriate on this record. \n \nWe turn to the question of reliance and the fraud on-the-market theory. Succinctly put: \n \nThe fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed \nsecurities market, the price of a company’s stock is determined by the available information \nregarding the company and its business.…Misleading statements will therefore defraud \npurchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.…The causal \nconnection between the defendants’ fraud and the plaintiff’s purchase of stock in such a case is no \nless significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. Peil v. Speiser, 806 F.2d \n1154, 1160-1161 (CA3 1986). \n \n* * * \nWe agree that reliance is an element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action. Reliance provides the requisite causal \nconnection between a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s \ninjury. There is, however, more than one way to demonstrate the causal connection. \n \n* * * \n \nPresumptions typically serve to assist courts in managing circumstances in which direct proof, for one \nreason or another, is rendered difficult.

            "chunk": "provides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect. Many of the laws expressly gave management of the target companies a right to a hearing, which \ncould be dragged out for weeks or months, giving the target time to build up a defense. The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana second-\ngeneration statute that prevents an offeror who has acquired 20 percent or more of a target’s stock from \nvoting unless other shareholders (not including management) approve. The vote to approve can be \ndelayed for up to fifty days from the date the offeror files a statement reporting the acquisition. The Court \nconcluded that the Commerce Clause was not violated nor was the Williams Act, because the Indiana law, \nunlike the Illinois law in Mite, was consistent with the Williams Act, since it protects shareholders, does \nnot unreasonably delay the tender offer, and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. [6] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n753 \nEmboldened by the CTS decision, almost half the states have adopted a third-generation law that requires \na bidder to wait several years before merging with the target company unless the target’s board agrees in \nadvance to the merger. Because in many cases a merger is the reason for the bid, these laws are especially \npowerful. In 1989, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wisconsin’s third-generation law, saying \nthat it did not violate the Commerce Clause and that it was not preempted by the Williams Act. The \nSupreme Court decided not to review the decision. [7] \n \nShort-Form Mergers \nIf one company acquires 90 percent or more of the stock of another company, it can merge with the target \ncompany through the so-called short-form merger. Only the parent company’s board of directors need \napprove the merger; consent of the shareholders of either company is unnecessary. \n \nAppraisal Rights \nIf a shareholder has the right to vote on a corporate plan to merge, consolidate, or sell all or substantially \nall of its assets, that shareholder has the right to dissent and invoke appraisal rights. Returning again to \nBCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the \nwisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying \nTruckman. The law requires the shareholder to file with the corporation, before the vote, a notice of \nintention to demand the fair value of his shares. If the plan is approved and the shareholder does not vote \nin favor, the corporation must send a notice to the shareholder specifying procedures for obtaining \npayment, and the shareholder must demand payment within the time set in the notice, which cannot be \nless than thirty days. Fair value means the value of shares immediately before the effective date of the \ncorporate action to which the shareholder has objected. Appreciation and depreciation in anticipation of \nthe action are excluded, unless the exclusion is unfair. \n \nIf the shareholder and the company cannot agree on the fair value, the shareholder must file a petition \nrequesting a court to determine the fair value. The method of determining fair value depends on the \ncircumstances. When there is a public market for stock traded on an exchange, fair value is usually the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n754 \nprice quoted on the exchange. In some circumstances, other factors, especially net asset value and \ninvestment value—for example, earnings potential—assume greater importance. \n \nSee Hariton v. Arco Electronics, Inc.

The first involves the purchase of assets not in the \nordinary course of business. Using this method, the purchase expands the corporation. The second and third \nmethods, merger and consolidation, are very similar: two or more corporations combine. In a merger, one of \nthe merging companies survives, and the other ceases to exist. In a consolidation, the merging corporations \ncease to exist when they combine to form a new corporation. The final method is a stock purchase, \naccomplished via a tender offer, takeover, or leveraged buyout. Federal and state regulations play a significant \nrole in takeovers and tender offers, particularly the Williams Act. A shareholder who does not wish to \nparticipate in a stock sale may invoke his appraisal rights and demand cash compensation for his shares. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts. [2] \n \nTypical Requirements for Foreign Corporations \nCertain preconditions for doing business are common to most states.

[2] \n \nTypical Requirements for Foreign Corporations \nCertain preconditions for doing business are common to most states. Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however. The state attorney general has authority to collect \ncivil penalties that vary from state to state. Other sanctions in various states include fines and penalties on \ntaxes owed; fines and imprisonment of corporate agents, directors, and officers; nullification of corporate \ncontracts; and personal liability on contracts by officers and directors. In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court \nupheld the validity of long-arm statutes applied to corporations in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington. [3] But the long-arm statute will only be constitutionally valid where there are minimum \ncontacts—that is, for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, the foreign \ncorporation must have at least “minimum contacts” the state. That jurisdictional test is still applied many \nyears after the International Shoe decision was handed down. [4] Since International Shoe, the \nnationalization of commerce has given way to the internationalization of commerce. This change has \nresulted in difficult jurisdictional questions that involve conflicting policy considerations.

Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause.

The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state. These transactions must meet the minimum-contacts \nrequirement for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes. A state may tax a foreign corporation as long as it does \nnot burden interstate commerce. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n759 \n \n1.

State and local government regulations may also apply. \n \nVoluntary Dissolution \nAny corporation may be dissolved with the unanimous written consent of the shareholders; this is \na voluntary dissolution. This provision is obviously applicable primarily to closely held corporations. \nDissolution can also be accomplished even if some shareholders dissent. The directors must first adopt a \nresolution by majority vote recommending the dissolution. The shareholders must then have an \nopportunity to vote on the resolution at a meeting after being notified of its purpose. A majority of the \noutstanding voting shares is necessary to carry the resolution. Although this procedure is most often used \nwhen a company has been inactive, nothing bars its use by large corporations. In 1979, UV Industries, \n357th on the Fortune 500 list, with profits of $40 million annually, voted to dissolve and to distribute \nsome $500 million to its stockholders, in part as a means of fending off a hostile takeover. Fortune \nmagazine referred to it as “a company that’s worth more dead than alive.” [2] \n \nOnce dissolution has been approved, the corporation may dissolve by filing a certificate or articles of \ndissolution with the secretary of state. The certificate may be filed as the corporation begins to wind up its \naffairs or at any time thereafter. The process of winding up is liquidation. The company must notify all \ncreditors of its intention to liquidate. It must collect and dispose of its assets, discharge all obligations, \nand distribute any remainder to its stockholders. \n \nInvoluntary Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n761 \nIn certain cases, a corporation can face involuntary dissolution. A state may bring an action to \ndissolve a corporation on one of five grounds: failure to file an annual report or pay taxes, fraud in \nprocuring incorporation, exceeding or abusing authority conferred, failure for thirty days to appoint and \nmaintain a registered agent, and failure to notify the state of a change of registered office or agent. State-\nspecific differences exist as well. Delaware permits its attorney general to involuntarily dissolve a \ncorporation for abuse, misuse, or nonuse of corporate powers, privileges, or franchise. [3] California, on the \nother hand, permits involuntary dissolution for abandonment of a business, board deadlocks, internal \nstrife and deadlocked shareholders, mismanagement, fraud or abuse of authority, expiration of term of \ncorporation, or protection of a complaining shareholder if there are fewer than thirty-five \nshareholders. [4]California permits the initiation of involuntary dissolution by either half of the directors in \noffice or by a third of shareholders. \n \nJudicial Liquidation \nAction by Shareholder \nA shareholder may file suit to have a court dissolve the company on a showing that the company is being \nirreparably injured because the directors are deadlocked in the management of corporate affairs and the \nshareholders cannot break the deadlock. Shareholders may also sue for liquidation if corporate assets are \nbeing misapplied or wasted, or if directors or those in control are acting illegally, oppressively, or \nfraudulently. \n \nClaims against a Dissolved Corporation \nUnder Sections 14.06 and 14.07 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act, a dissolved corporation \nmust provide written notice of the dissolution to its creditors. The notice must state a deadline, which \nmust be at least 120 days after the notice, for receipt of creditors’ claims. Claims not received by the \ndeadline are barred. The corporation may also publish a notice of the dissolution in a local newspaper. \nCreditors who do not receive written notice or whose claim is not acted on have five years to file suit \nagainst the corporation. If the corporate assets have been distributed, shareholders are personally liable, \nalthough the liability may not exceed the assets received at liquidation. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n762 \nBankruptcy \nAs an alternative to dissolution, a corporation in financial trouble may look to federal bankruptcy law for \nrelief. A corporation may use liquidation proceedings under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act or \nmay be reorganized under Chapter 11 of the act. Both remedies are discussed in detail in Chapter 27 \n\"Bankruptcy\". \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nDissolution is the end of the legal existence of a corporation. It usually occurs after liquidation, which is the \nprocess of paying debts and distributing assets. There are several methods by which a corporation may be \ndissolved.

Negotiation always requires a change in possession \nof the instrument because nobody can be a holder without possessing the instrument, either \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n812 \ndirectly or through an agent. But in some cases the transfer of possession is involuntary and in \nsome cases the person transferring possession is not a holder.…[S]ubsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is \npayable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the \nholder of the instrument when possession is obtained. In this case there is an involuntary transfer \nof possession that results in negotiation to Thief or Finder. [1] \n \nIn other words, to qualify as a holder, a person must possess an instrument that runs to her. An \ninstrument “runs” to a person if (1) it has been issued to her or (2) it has been transferred to her by \nnegotiation (negotiation is the “post-issuance event” cited in the comment). Commercially speaking, the \nstatus of the immediate person to whom the instrument was issued (the payee) is not very interesting; the \nthing of interest is whether the instrument is passed on by the payee after possession, through \nnegotiation. Yes, the payee of an instrument is a holder, and can be a holder in due course, but the crux of \nnegotiable instruments involves taking an instrument free of defenses that might be claimed by anybody \nagainst paying on the instrument; the payee would know of defenses, usually, so—as the comment puts \nit—“use of the holder-in-due-course doctrine by the payee of an instrument is not the normal \nsituation.…[r]ather, the holder in due course is an immediate or remote transferee of the payee.” [2] \n \nLiability of Transferors \nWe discuss liability in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". However, a brief introduction to liability will \nhelp in understanding the types of indorsements discussed in this chapter. There are two types of liability \naffecting transferors: contract liability and warranty liability. \n \nContract Liability \nPersons who sign the instrument—that is, makers, acceptors, drawers, indorsers—have signed a contract \nand are subject to contract liabilities. Drafts (checks) and notes are, after all, contracts. Makers and \nacceptors are primary parties and are unconditionally liable to pay the instrument. Drawers and \nindorsers are secondary parties and are conditionally liable. The conditions creating liability—that is, \npresentment, dishonor, and notice—are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n813 \n \nWarranty Liability \nThe transferor’s contract liability is limited. It applies only to those who sign and only if certain additional \nconditions are met and, as will be discussed, can even be disclaimed. Consequently, a holder who has not \nbeen paid often must resort to a suit based on one of five warranties. These warranties are implied by law; \nUCC, Section 3-416, details them: \n \n(A) A person who transfers an instrument for consideration warrants all of the following to the \ntransferee and, if the transfer is by indorsement, to any subsequent transferee: \n(1) The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the instrument. \n(2) All signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized. \n(3) The instrument has not been altered. \n(4) The instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which can be \nasserted against the warrantor. \n(5) The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to \nthe maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer. \n \nBreach of one of these warranties must be proven at trial if there is no general contract liability. \n \nLiability of Transferees \nThe transferee takes by assignment; as an assignee, the new owner of the instrument has only those rights \nheld by the assignor. Claims that could be asserted by third parties against the assignor can be asserted \nagainst the assignee. A negotiable instrument can be transferred in this sense without being negotiated. A \npayee, for example, might fail to meet all the requirements of negotiation; in that event, the instrument \nmight wind up being merely transferred (assigned). When all requirements of negotiability and \nnegotiation have been met, the buyer is a holder and may (if a holder in due course—see Chapter 21 \n\"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\") collect on the instrument without having to prove anything more. \nBut if the instrument was not properly negotiated, the purchaser is at most a transferee and cannot collect \nif defenses are available, even if the paper itself is negotiable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n814 \n \nHow Negotiation Is Accomplished \nNegotiation can occur with either bearer paper or order paper.",

Section 3-206(a) of the UCC provides that an attempt to limit payment to a particular person or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n821 \nprohibit further transfer “is not effective.” Nor is “[a]n indorsement stating a condition to the right of the \nindorsee to receive payment”; the restriction may be disregarded. However, two legitimate restrictive \nindorsements are valid: collection indorsements and trust indorsements. Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. \nv. Richland State Bank (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with conditional and restrictive indorsements. \n \nCollection Indorsement \nIt is very common for people and businesses to mail checks to their bank for deposit to their accounts. \nSometimes mail goes astray or gets stolen. Surely it must be permissible for the customer to safeguard the \ncheck by restricting its use to depositing it in her account. A collection indorsement, such as “For \ndeposit” or “For collection,” is effective. Section 3-206(c) of the UCC provides that anybody other than a \nbank who purchases the instrument with such an indorsement converts the instrument—effectively steals \nit. A depositary bank that takes it must deposit it as directed, or the bank has converted it. A payor bank \nthat is also the depositary bank that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter \nconverts it: the check cannot be cashed; it must be deposited (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\"). \n \nTo illustrate, suppose that Kate Jones indorses her paycheck “For deposit only, Kate Jones,” which is by \nfar the most common type of restrictive indorsement (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", right). A \nthief steals the check, indorses his name below the restrictive indorsement, and deposits the check in Last \nBank, where he has an account, or cashes it. The check moves through the collection process to Second \nBank and then to First Bank, which pays the check. Kate has the right to recover only from Last Bank, \nwhich did not properly honor the indorsement by depositing the payment in her account. \n \nTrust Indorsement \nA second legitimate restrictive indorsement is indorsement in trust, called a \ntrust indorsement (sometimes agency indorsement). Suppose Paul Payee owes Carlene Creditor a \ndebt. Payee indorses a check drawn to him by a third party, “Pay to Tina Attorney in trust for Carlene \nCreditor.” Attorney indorses in blank and delivers it to (a) a holder for value, (b) a depository bank for \ncollection, or (c) a payor bank for payment. In each case, these takers can safely pay Attorney so long as \nthey have no notice under Section 3-307 of the UCC of any breach of fiduciary duty that Attorney may be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n822 \ncommitting. For example, under Section 3-307(b), these takers have notice of a breach of trust if the check \nwas taken in any transaction known by the taker to be for Attorney’s personal benefit. Subsequent \ntransferees of the check from the holder or depositary bank are not affected by the restriction unless they \nhave knowledge that Attorney dealt with the check in breach of trust (adapted from UCC, Section 3-206, \nOfficial Comment 4). (Of course Attorney should not indorse in blank; she should indorse “Tina Attorney, \nin trust for Carlene Creditor” and deposit the check in her trust account.) \n \nThe dichotomy here between restrictive and unrestrictive indorsements is the indorser’s way of showing \nto what use the instrument may be put. \n \nConditional Indorsement \nAn indorser might want to condition the negotiation of an instrument upon some event, such as “Pay \nCarla Green if she finishes painting my house by July 15.” Such a conditional indorsement is generally \nineffective: the UCC, Section 3-206(b), says a person paying for value can disregard the condition without \nliability. \n \nQualified Indorsement \nAn indorser can limit his liability by making a qualified indorsement. The usual qualified indorsement \nconsists of the words “without recourse,” which mean that the indorser has no contract liability to \nsubsequent holders if a maker or drawee defaults. A qualified indorsement does not impair negotiability. \nThe qualification must be in writing by signature on the instrument itself. By disclaiming contract \nliability, the qualified indorser also limits his warranty liabilities, though he does not eliminate them. \nSection 3-415(a) of the UCC narrows the indorser’s warranty that no defense of any party is good against \nthe indorser. In its place, the qualified indorser warrants merely that he has no knowledge of any defense. \n \n“Without recourse” indorsements can have a practical impact on the balance sheet. A company holding a \npromissory note can obtain cash by discounting it—indorsing it over to a bank for maturity value less the \nbank’s discount. As an indorser, however, the company remains liable to pay the amount to subsequent \nholders should the maker default at maturity. The balance sheet must reflect this possibility as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n823",

Love remains liable to Steve Supplier for the money that she owes him, and \nLove is out the $2,000 unless she can find Wright. \n \nThe difference between this case and the one involving the forger Carl Crooks is that in the second case \nthe imposter (Wright) “induced the maker or drawer [Lorna Love] to issue the instrument…by \nimpersonating the payee of the instrument [Steve Supplier]” (UCC, Section 3-404(a)), whereas in the first \ncase the thief did not induce Love to issue the check to him—he simply found it. And the rationale for \nmaking Lorna Love bear the loss is that she failed to detect the scam: she intended the imposter, Wright, \nto receive the instrument. Section 3-404(c) provides that the indorsement of the imposter (Wright, posing \nas Steve Supplier) is effective. The same rule applies if the imposter poses as an agent: if the check is \npayable to Supplier, Inc., a company whose president is Steve Supplier, and an impostor impersonates \nSteve Supplier, the check could be negotiated if the imposter indorses it as Supplier, Inc.’s, agent “Steve \nSupplier.”[2] \n \nSimilarly, suppose Love is approached by a young man who says to her, “My company sells tennis balls, \nand we’re offering a special deal this month: a can of three high-quality balls for $2 each. We’ll send your \norder to you by UPS.” He hands her a sample ball: it is substantial, and the price is good. Love has heard \nof the company the man says he represents; she makes out a check for $100 to “Sprocket Athletic Supply.” \nThe young man does not represent the company at all, but he cashes the check by forging the indorsement \nand the bank pays. Love takes the loss: surely she is more to blame than the bank. \n \nThe Fictitious Payee Rule \nSuppose Lorna Love has a bookkeeper, Abby Accountant. Abby presents several checks for Love to sign, \none made out to Carlos Aquino. Perhaps there really is no such person, or perhaps he is somebody whom \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n828 \nLove deals with regularly, but Accountant intends him to have no interest here. No matter: Love signs the \ncheck in the amount of $2,000. Accountant takes the check and indorses it: “Carlos Aquino, pay to the \norder of Abby Accountant.” Then she signs her name as the next indorser and cashes the check at Love’s \nbank. The check is good, even though it was never intended by Accountant that “Carlos Aquino”—\nthe fictitious payee—have any interest in the instrument. The theory here is to “place the loss on the \ndrawer of the check rather than on the drawee or the Depositary Bank that took the check for \ncollection.…The drawer is in the best position to avoid the fraud and thus should take the loss.” [3] This is \nalso known as “the padded-payroll rule.” \n \nIn the imposter cases, Love drew checks made out to real names but gave them to the wrong person (the \nimposter); in the fictitious payee cases she wrote checks to a nonexistent person (or a real person who was \nnot intended to have any interest at all). \nThe Dishonest Employee Rule \nThe UCC takes head-on the recurring problem of a dishonest employee. It says that if an employer \n“entrust[s] an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person \nacting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement \nis effective.” [4] For example (adapted from UCC 3-405, Official Comment 3; the Comment does not use \nthe names of these characters, of course), the duties of Abby Accountant, a bookkeeper, include posting \nthe amounts of checks payable to Lorna Love to the accounts of the drawers of the checks. Accountant \nsteals a check payable to Love, which was entrusted to Accountant, and forges Love’s indorsement. The \ncheck is deposited by Accountant to an account in the depositary bank that Accountant opened in the \nsame name as Lorna Love, and the check is honored by the drawee bank. The indorsment is effective as \nLove’s indorsement because Accountant’s duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes. \nThus Accountant is entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check. Neither the depositary bank \nnor the drawee bank is liable to Love for conversion of the check. The same result would follow if \nAccountant deposited the check in the account in the depositary bank without indorsement (UCC, Section \n4-205(a)). Under Section 4-205(c), deposit in a depositary bank in an account in a name substantially \nsimilar to that of Lorna Love is the equivalent of an indorsement in the name of Lorna Love. If, say, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n829 \njanitor had stolen the checks, the result would be different, as the janitor is not entrusted with \nresponsibility regarding the instrument. \n \nNegligence \nNot surprisingly, though, if a person fails to exercise ordinary care and thereby substantially contributes",

As explained in [Citation]: \nIn addition to accepting bets placed at parimutuel facility windows staffed by facility employees, \n[some] facilities use SAMS. SAMS are automated machines which permit a bettor to enter his bet \nby inserting money, vouchers or credit cards into the machine, thereby enabling him to select the \nnumber or combination he wishes to purchase. A ticket is issued showing those numbers. [1] \n \nWhen a voucher is utilized for the purpose of placing a bet at a SAMS machine, the SAMS machine, after \ndeducting the amount bet by the horse player during the particular transaction, provides the horse player \nwith, in addition to his betting ticket(s), a new voucher showing the remaining balance left on the \nvoucher. \n \nIn the instant case, the unfortunate horse player departed the SAMS machine with his betting tickets, \nbut without his new voucher—showing thousands of dollars in remaining value—which he inadvertently \nleft sitting in the SAMS machine. Within several minutes he realized his mistake and hurried back to the \nSAMS machine, only to find the voucher gone. He immediately notified a security guard. The defendant’s \npersonnel thereafter quickly confirmed the plaintiff as the original purchaser of the lost voucher. The \ndefendant placed a computerized “stop” on the voucher. However, whoever had happened upon the \nvoucher in the SAMS machine and taken it had acted even more quickly: the voucher had been brought to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n832 \na nearby track window and “cashed out” within a minute or so of the plaintiff having mistakenly left it in \nthe SAMS machine. \n \nThe plaintiff now sues the defendant, contending that the defendant should be liable for having failed to \n“provide any minimal protection to its customers” in checking the identity and ownership of vouchers \nprior to permitting their “cash out.” The defendant, in response, contends that the voucher consists of \n“bearer paper,” negotiable by anyone having possession, and that it is under no obligation to purchasers \nof vouchers to provide any such identity or ownership checks. \n \nAs opposed to instruments such as ordinary checks, which are typically made payable to the order of a \nspecific person and are therefore known as “order paper,” bearer paper is payable to the “bearer,” i.e., \nwhoever walks in carrying (or “bearing”) the instrument. Pursuant to [New York’s UCC] “[a]n instrument \nis payable to bearer when by its terms it is payable to…(c) ‘cash’ or the order of ‘cash’, or any other \nindication which does not purport to designate a specific payee.” \n \nEach New York Racing Association voucher is labeled “Cash Voucher.” Each voucher contains the legend \n“Bet Against the Value or Exchange for Cash.” Each voucher is also encoded with certain computer \nsymbols which are readable by SAMS machines. The vouchers do by their terms constitute “bearer paper.” \n \nThere is no doubt that under the [1990 Revision] Model Uniform Commercial Code the defendant would \nbe a “holder in due course” of the voucher, deemed to have taken it free from all defenses that could be \nraised by the plaintiff. As observed in 2 White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code pp. 225–226, 152–\n153 (4th ed.1995): \n \nConsider theft of bearer instruments…[T]he thief can make his or her transferee a holder simply \nby transfer to one who gives value in good faith. If the thief’s transferee cashes the check and so \ngives value in good faith and without notice of any defense, that transferee will be a holder in due \ncourse under 3-302, free of all claims to the instrument on the part…of any person and free of all \npersonal defenses of any prior party. Therefore, the holder in due course will not be liable in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n833 \nconversion to the true owner.…Of course, the owner of the check will have a good cause of action \nagainst the thief, but no other cause of action.… \n \nIf an instrument is payable to bearer…the possessor of the instrument will be a holder and, if he \nmeets the other tests, a holder in due course. This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York.

            "chunk": "depositary bank under these sections” [Citation]…The Court finds the reasoning persuasive and holds \nthat…Victory can maintain its cause of action against Wachovia. \n \nIII. The Fictitious Payee Rule \nLunny made the fraudulent checks payable to actual vendors of Victory with the intention that the \nvendors not get paid. Wachovia therefore argues that Victory’s action against it should be barred by the \nfictitious payee rule under UCC 3-404 [which] states, in relevant part: \n \n(b) Fictitious Payee. If a person…does not intend the person identified as payee to have any \ninterest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, \nthe following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement: \n(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder. \n(2) An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as \nthe indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes \nit for value or for collection.… \n \nThe theory under the rule is that since the indorsement is “effective,” the drawee bank was justified in \ndebiting the company’s account. Therefore, [Wachovia argues] the loss should fall on the company whose \nemployee committed the fraud. \n \n…[However] under revised UCC §§ 3-404 and 3-405, the fictitious payee defense triggers principles of \ncomparative fault, so a depositary bank’s own negligence may be considered by the trier of \nfact.…Therefore, based on the foregoing reasons, the fictitious payee defense does not help Wachovia in \nthis case. \n \n \n \nIV. Allocation of Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n840 \nAs stated supra, comparative negligence applies in this case because of the revisions in the Code. In \ndetermining the liability of the parties, the Court has considered, inter alia [among other things], the \nfollowing factors: \n \n• \nAt the time of the fraud by Lunny, Wachovia’s policies and regulations regarding the acceptance \nof checks for deposit provided that “checks payable to a non-personal payee can be deposited \nONLY into a non-personal account with the same name.” [Emphasis in original] \n• \nApproximately two hundred (200) checks drawn on Victory’s corporate account were deposited \ninto Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. \n• \nThe first twenty-three (23) fraudulent checks were made payable to entities that were not readily \ndistinguishable as businesses, such as “Sean John.” The check dated December 17, 2001 was the \nfirst fraudulent check made payable to a payee that was clearly a business, specifically “Beverly \nHills Shoes, Inc.” \n• \nIn 2001, Victory had approximately seventeen (17) employees, including Lunny. \n• \nLunny had been a bookkeeper for Victory from approximately 1982 until she resigned in May \n2003. Rosenfeld never had any problems with Lunny’s bookkeeping before she resigned. \n• \nLunny exercised primary control over Victory’s bank accounts. \n• \nBetween 2001 and 2003, the checks that were generated to make payments to Victory’s vendors \nwere all computerized checks generated by Lunny. No other Victory employee, other than Lunny, \nknew how to generate the computerized checks, including Rosenfeld. \n• \nThe fraudulent checks were made payable to known vendors of Victory in amounts that were \nconsistent with previous legitimate checks to those vendors. \n• \nAfter forging the indorsement of the payee, Lunny either indorsed the check with her name \nfollowed by her account number, or referenced her account number following the forged \nindorsement. \n• \nAbout ten (10) out of approximately three hundred (300) checks each month were forged by \nLunny and deposited into her personal account. \n• \nRosenfeld reviewed his bank statements from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n841 \n• \nRosenfeld received copies of Victory’s cancelled checks from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nHowever, the copies of the cancelled checks were not in their normal size; instead, they were \nsmaller, with six checks (front and back side) on each page. \n• \nThe forged indorsements were written out in longhand, i.e., Lunny’s own handwriting, rather \nthan a corporate stamped signature. \n• \nVictory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each month. \n• \nAn outside accounting firm performed quarterly reviews of Victory’s bookkeeping records, and \nthen met with Rosenfeld. This review was not designed to pick up fraud or misappropriation. \n \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Victory and Wachovia are comparatively negligent. \n \nWith regard to Wachovia’s negligence, it is clear that Wachovia was negligent in violating its own rules in \nrepeatedly depositing corporate checks into Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. Standard commercial \nbank procedures dictate that a check made payable to a business be accepted only into a business \nchecking account with the same title as the business. Had a single teller at Wachovia followed Wachovia’s",

So a holder is one who \npossesses an instrument and who has all the necessary indorsements. \n \nTaken for Value \nSection 3-303 of the UCC describes what is meant by transferring an instrument “for value.” In a broad \nsense, it means the holder has given something for it, which sounds like consideration. But “value” here is \nnot the same as consideration under contract law. Here is the UCC language: \n \nAn instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply: \n \n(1) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the \npromise has been performed. \n(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien \nobtained by judicial proceeding. \n(3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim \nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n856 \n(4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. \n(5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable \nobligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument. \n \n1. For a promise, to the extent performed. Suppose A contracts with B: “I’ll buy your car for $5,000.” \nUnder contract law, A has given consideration: the promise is enough. But this executory (not yet \nperformed) promise given by A is not giving “value” to support the HDC status because the promise has \nnot been performed. \n \nLorna Love sells her car to Paul Purchaser for $5,000, and Purchaser gives her a note in that amount. \nLove negotiates the note to Rackets, Inc., for a new shipment of tennis rackets to be delivered in thirty \ndays. Rackets never delivers the tennis rackets. Love has a claim for $5,000 against Rackets, which is not \nan HDC because its promise to deliver is still executory. Assume Paul Purchaser has a defense against \nLove (a reason why he doesn’t want to pay on the note), perhaps because the car was defective. When \nRackets presents the note to Purchaser for payment, he refuses to pay, raising his defense against Love. If \nRackets had been an HDC, Purchaser would be obligated to pay on the note regardless of the defense he \nmight have had against Love, the payee. See Carter & Grimsley v. Omni Trading, Inc., Section 21.3 \n\"Cases\", regarding value as related to executory contracts. \n \nA taker for value can be a partial HDC if the consideration was only partly performed. Suppose the tennis \nrackets were to come in two lots, each worth $2,500, and Rackets only delivered one lot. Rackets would be \nan HDC only to the extent of $2,500, and the debtor—Paul Purchaser—could refuse to pay $2,500 of the \npromised sum. \n \nThe UCC presents two exceptions to the rule that an executory promise is not value. Section 3-303(a)(4) \nprovides that an instrument is issued or transferred for value if the issuer or transferor gives it in \nexchange for a negotiable instrument, and Section 3-303(5) says an instrument is transferred for value if \nthe issuer gives it in exchange for an irrevocable obligation to a third party. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n857 \n2. Security interest. Value is not limited to cash or the fulfillment of a contractual obligation. A holder \nwho acquires a lien on, or a security interest in, an instrument other than by legal process has taken for \nvalue. \n \n3. Antecedent debt. Likewise, taking an instrument in payment of, or as security for, a prior claim, \nwhether or not the claim is due, is a taking for value. Blackstone owes Webster $1,000, due in thirty days. \nBlackstone unexpectedly receives a refund check for $1,000 from the Internal Revenue Service and \nindorses it to Webster. Webster is an HDC though he gave value in the past. \n \nThe rationale for the rule of value is that if the holder has not yet given anything of value in exchange for \nthe instrument, he still has an effective remedy should the instrument prove defective: he can rescind the \ntransaction, given the transferor’s breach of warranty. \n \nIn Good Faith \nSection 3-103(4) of the UCC defines good faith as “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable \ncommercial standards of fair dealing.” \n \nHonesty in Fact \n“Honesty in fact” is subjectively tested. Suppose Lorna Love had given Rackets, Inc., a promissory note for \nthe tennis rackets. Knowing that it intended to deliver defective tennis rackets and that Love is likely to \nprotest as soon as the shipment arrives, Rackets offers a deep discount on the note to its fleet mechanic: \ninstead of the $1,000 face value of the note, Rackets will give it to him in payment of an outstanding bill of \n$400. The mechanic, being naive in commercial dealings, has no suspicion from the large discount that \nRackets might be committing fraud. He has acted in good faith under the UCC test.

Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments.

Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn.

Judge Hoens concluded that because the \ncheck cashing companies took the checks in good faith, plaintiff was a holder in due course as assignee. \nJudge Hoens also found that because the checks appeared to be genuine, Hauser Co. was required, but \nhad failed, to show that plaintiff’s assignor had any notice that the checks were not validly drawn.… \n \nHauser Co. argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because the court failed to properly \naddress Hauser Co.’s defense that the checks at issue were invalid negotiable instruments and therefore \nerred in finding plaintiff was a holder in due course. \n \nAs a threshold matter, it is evident that the eighteen checks meet the definition of a negotiable instrument \n[UCC 3-104]. Each check is payable to a bearer for a fixed amount, on demand, and does not state any \nother undertaking by the person promising payment, aside from the payment of money. In addition, each \ncheck appears to have been signed by Mr. Hauser, through the use of a facsimile stamp, permitted by the \nUCC to take the place of a manual signature. [Section 3-401(b) of the UCC] provides that a “signature may \nbe made manually or by means of a device or machine…with present intention to authenticate a writing.” \nIt is uncontroverted by Hauser Co. that the facsimile signature stamp on the checks is identical to Hauser \nCo.’s authorized stamp. \n \nHauser Co., however, contends that the checks are not negotiable instruments because Mr. Hauser did not \nsign the checks, did not authorize their signing, and its payroll service, ADP, did not produce the checks. \nLack of authorization, however, is a separate issue from whether the checks are negotiable instruments. \nConsequently, given that the checks are negotiable instruments, the next issue is whether the checks are \nunenforceable by a holder in due course, because the signature on the checks was forged or unauthorized. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n879 \n \n[Sections 3-203 and 3-302 of the UCC] discuss the rights of a holder in due course and the rights of a \ntransferee of a holder in due course.

App. 2008) \n \nGabbard, J. \n \nPlaintiff, Bank of Nichols Hills (BNH), appeals a trial court judgment for Defendant, Bank of Oklahoma \n(BOK), regarding payment of a forged check. The primary issue on appeal is whether BOK presented \nsufficient proof to support the trial court’s finding that the [UCC] § 3-406 preclusion defense applied. We \nfind that it did, and affirm. \n \nFacts \nMichael and Stacy Russell owned a mobile home in Harrah, Oklahoma. The home was insured by \nOklahoma Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau). The insurance policy provided that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n913 \nin case of loss, Farm Bureau “will pay you unless another payee is named on the Declarations page,” that \n“Loss shall be payable to any mortgagee named in the Declarations,” and that one of Farm Bureau’s duties \nwas to “protect the mortgagee’s interests in the insured building.” The Declarations page of the policy \nlisted Conseco Finance as the mortgagee. Conseco had a mortgage security interest in the home. \nIn August 2002, a fire completely destroyed the mobile home. The Russells submitted an insurance claim \nto Farm Bureau. Farm Bureau then negotiated a $69,000 settlement with the Russells, issued them a \ncheck in this amount payable to them and Conseco jointly, and mailed the check to the Russells. Neither \nthe Russells nor Farm Bureau notified Conseco of the loss, the settlement, or the mailing of the check. \n \nThe check was drawn on Farm Bureau’s account at BNH. The Russells deposited the check into their \naccount at BOK. The check contains an endorsement by both Russells, and a rubber stamp endorsement \nfor Conseco followed by a signature of a Donna Marlatt and a phone number. It is undisputed that \nConseco’s endorsement was forged. Upon receipt, BOK presented the check to BNH. BNH paid the \n$69,000 check and notified Farm Bureau that the check had been paid from its account. \n \nAbout a year later, Conseco learned about the fire and the insurance payoff. Conseco notified Farm \nBureau that it was owed a mortgage balance of more than $50,000. Farm Bureau paid off the balance and \nnotified BNH of the forgery. BNH reimbursed Farm Bureau the amount paid to Conseco. BNH then sued \nBOK. \n \nBoth banks relied on the Uniform Commercial Code. BNH asserted that under § 4-208, BOK had \nwarranted that all the indorsements on the check were genuine. BOK asserted an affirmative defense \nunder § 3-406, alleging that Farm Bureau’s own negligence contributed to the forgery. After a non-jury \ntrial, the court granted judgment to BOK, finding as follows: \n \n• \nConseco’s endorsement was a forgery, accomplished by the Russells; \n• \nFarm Bureau was negligent in the manner and method it used to process the claim and pay the \nsettlement without providing any notice or opportunity for involvement in the process to \nConseco; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n914 \n• \nFarm Bureau’s negligence substantially contributed to the Russells’ conduct in forging Conseco’s \nendorsement; and \n• \nBOK proved its affirmative defense under § 3-406 by the greater weight of the evidence. \n \nFrom this judgment, BNH appeals. \n \nAnalysis \nIt cannot be disputed that BOK breached its presentment warranty to BNH under § 4-208. [1] Thus the \nprimary issue raised is whether BOK established a preclusion defense under 3-406 [that BNH is \nprecluded from complaining about BOK’s breach of presentment warranty because of its own \nnegligence]. [2] BNH asserts that the evidence fails to establish this defense because the mailing of its \ncheck to and receipt by the insured “is at most an event of opportunity and has nothing to do with the \nactual forgery.” \n \nSection 3-406 requires less stringent proof than the “direct and proximate cause” test for general \nnegligence. [3] Conduct is a contributing cause of an alteration or forgery if it is a substantial factor in \nbringing it about, or makes it “easier for the wrongdoer to commit his wrong.” The UCC Comment to § 3-\n406 notes that the term has the meaning as used by the Pennsylvania court in Thompson [Citation]. \n \nIn Thompson, an independent logger named Albers obtained blank weighing slips, filled them out to show \nfictitious deliveries of logs for local timber owners, delivered the slips to the company, accepted checks \nmade payable to the timber owners, forged the owners’ signatures, and cashed the checks at the bank. \nWhen the company discovered the scheme, it sued the bank and the bank raised § 3-406 as a defense. The \ncourt specifically found that the company’s negligence did not have to be the direct and proximate cause \nof the bank’s acceptance of the forged checks. Instead, the defense applied because the company left blank \nlogging slips readily accessible to haulers, the company had given Albers whole pads of blank slips, the \nslips were not consecutively numbered, haulers were allowed to deliver both the original and duplicate",

Bank of America \n821 A.2d 22 (Md. 2003) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n917 \nAt some point in time prior to 3 August 2000, Petitioner, as a holder, came into possession of a check in \nthe amount of Nine Hundred Seventy-Six Dollars ($976.00) (the check) from Toyson J. Burruss, the \ndrawer, doing business as Prestige Auto Detail Center. Instead of depositing the check into his account at \nhis own bank, Petitioner elected to present the check for payment at a branch of Mr. Burruss’ bank, Bank \nof America, the drawee. [4] On 3 August 2000, Petitioner approached a teller at Bank of America…in \nBaltimore City and asked to cash the check. The teller, by use of a computer, confirmed the availability of \nfunds on deposit, and placed the check into the computer’s printer slot. The computer stamped certain \ndata on the back of the check, including the time, date, amount of the check, account number, and teller \nnumber. The computer also effected a hold on the amount of $976.00 in the customer’s account. The \nteller gave the check back to the Petitioner, who endorsed it. The teller then asked for Petitioner’s \nidentification. Petitioner presented his driver’s license and a major credit card. The teller took the \nindorsed check from Petitioner and manually inscribed the driver’s license information and certain credit \ncard information on the back of the check. \n \nAt some point during the transaction, the teller counted out $976.00 in cash from her drawer in \nanticipation of completing the transaction. She asked if the Petitioner was a customer of Bank of America. \nThe Petitioner stated that he was not. The teller returned the check to Petitioner and requested, consistent \nwith bank policy when cashing checks for non-customers, that Petitioner place his thumbprint on the \ncheck. [The thumbprint identification program was designed by various banking and federal agencies to \nreduce check fraud.] Petitioner refused and the teller informed him that she would be unable to complete \nthe transaction without his thumbprint. \n \n…Petitioner presented the check to the branch manager and demanded that the check be cashed \nnotwithstanding Petitioner’s refusal to place his thumbprint on the check. The branch manager examined \nthe check and returned it to the Petitioner, informing him that, because Petitioner was a non-customer, \nBank of America would not cash the check without Petitioner’s thumbprint on the instrument.…Petitioner \nleft the bank with the check in his possession.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n918 \nRather than take the check to his own bank and deposit it there, or returning it to Burruss, the drawer, as \ndishonored and demanding payment, Petitioner,…[sued] Bank of America (the Bank)…Petitioner claimed \nthat the Bank had violated the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and had violated his personal \nprivacy when the teller asked Petitioner to place an “inkless” thumbprint on the face of the check at \nissue.… \n \n…[T]he Circuit Court heard oral arguments…, entered summary judgment in favor of the Bank, dismissing \nthe Complaint with prejudice. [The special appeals court affirmed. The Court of Appeals—this court—\naccepted the appeal.] \n \n[Duty of Bank on Presentment and Acceptance] \n \nPetitioner argues that he correctly made “presentment” of the check to the Bank pursuant to § 3-111 and § \n3-501(a), and demands that, as the person named on the instrument and thus entitled to enforce the \ncheck, the drawee Bank pay him.…In a continuation, Petitioner contends that the teller, by placing the \ncheck in the slot of her computer, and the computer then printing certain information on the back of the \ncheck, accepted the check as defined by § 3-409(a).…Thus, according to Petitioner, because the Bank’s \ncomputer printed information on the back of the check, under § 3-401(b) the Bank “signed” the check, \nsaid “signature” being sufficient to constitute acceptance under § 3-409(a). \n \nPetitioner’s remaining arguments line up like so many dominos. According to Petitioner, having \nestablished that under his reading of § 3-409(a) the Bank accepted the check, Petitioner advances that the \nBank is obliged to pay him, pursuant to § 3-413(a)…Petitioner extends his line of reasoning by arguing \nthat the actions of the Bank amounted to a conversion under § 3-420,…Petitioner argues that because the \nBank accepted the check, an act which, according to Petitioner, discharged the drawer, he no longer had \nenforceable rights in the check and only had a right to the proceeds.

Petitioner’s position is that the Bank \nexercised unauthorized dominion and control over the proceeds of the check to the complete exclusion of \nthe Petitioner after the Bank accepted the check and refused to distribute the proceeds, counted out by the \nteller, to him. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n919 \n \nWe turn to the Bank’s obligations, or lack thereof, with regard to the presentment of a check by someone \nnot its customer. Bank argues, correctly, that it had no duty to the Petitioner, a non-customer and a \nstranger to the Bank, and that nothing in the Code allows Petitioner to force Bank of America to act as a \ndepository bank… \n \nAbsent a special relationship, a non-customer has no claim against a bank for refusing to honor a \npresented check. [Citations] This is made clear by § 3-408, which states: \n \nA check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the \ndrawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until the drawee \naccepts it. \n \nOnce a bank accepts a check, under § 3-409, it is obliged to pay on the check under § 3-413. Thus, the \nrelevant question in terms of any rights Petitioner had against the Bank [regarding presentment] turns \nnot on the reasonableness of the thumbprint identification, but rather upon whether the Bank accepted \nthe check when presented as defined by § 3-409. As will be seen infra [below] the question of the \nthumbprint identification is relevant only to the issue of whether the Bank’s refusal to pay the instrument \nconstituted dishonor under § 3-502, a determination which has no impact in terms of any duty allegedly \nowed by the Bank to the Petitioner. \n \nThe statute clearly states that acceptance becomes effective when the presenter is notified of that fact. The \nfacts demonstrate that at no time did the teller notify Petitioner that the Bank would pay on the check. \nRather, the facts show that: \n[T]he check was given back to [Petitioner] by the teller so that he could put his thumbprint \nsignature on it, not to notify or give him rights on the purported acceptance. After appellant \ndeclined to put his thumbprint signature on the check, he was informed by both the teller and the \nbranch manager that it was against bank policy to honor the check without a thumbprint \nsignature. Indignant, [Petitioner] walked out of the bank with the check. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n920 \n \nAs the intermediate appellate court correctly pointed out, the negotiation of the check is in the nature of a \ncontract, and there can be no agreement until notice of acceptance is received. As a result, there was never \nacceptance as defined by § 3-409(a), and thus the Bank, pursuant to § 3-408 never was obligated to pay \nthe check under § 3-413(a). Thus, the answer to Petitioner’s second question [Did the lower court err in \nfinding the Bank did not accept the…check at issue, as “acceptance” is defined in UCC Section 3-409?] is \n“no.” \n \n“Conversion” under § 3-420. \n \nBecause it never accepted the check, Bank of America argues that the intermediate appellate court also \ncorrectly concluded that the Bank did not convert the check or its proceeds under § 3-420. Again, we must \nagree. The Court of Special Appeals stated: \n \n“Conversion,” we have held, “requires not merely temporary interference with property rights, \nbut the exercise of unauthorized dominion and control to the complete exclusion of the rightful \npossessor.” [Citation] At no time did [Respondent] exercise “unauthorized dominion and control \n[over the check] to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor,” [Petitioner]. \n \n[Petitioner] voluntarily gave the check to [Respondent’s] teller. When [Petitioner] indicated to the \nteller that he was not an account holder, she gave the check back to him for a thumbprint \nsignature in accordance with bank policy. After being informed by both [Respondent’s] teller and \nbranch manager that it was [Respondent’s] policy not to cash a non-account holder’s check \nwithout a thumbprint signature, [Petitioner] left the bank with the check in hand. \n \nBecause [Petitioner] gave the check to the teller, [Respondent’s] possession of that check was \nanything but “unauthorized,” and having returned the check, within minutes of its receipt, to \n[Petitioner] for his thumbprint signature, [Respondent] never exercised “dominion and control",

The act provides certain warranties to protect \nrecipients of substitute checks that are intended to protect recipients against losses associated with the \ncheck substitution process. One of these warranties provides that “[a] bank that transfers, presents, or \nreturns a substitute check…for which it receives consideration warrants…that…[t]he substitute check \nmeets the requirements of legal equivalence” (12 CFR § 229.52(a)(1)). The Check 21 Act does not replace \nexisting state laws regarding such instruments. The Uniform Commercial Code still applies, and we turn \nto it next. \n \nTwo notable consequences of the Check 21 Act are worth mentioning. The first is that a check may be \npresented to the payor bank for payment very quickly, perhaps in less than an hour: the customer’s “float” \ntime is abbreviated. That means be sure you have enough money in your account to cover the checks that \nyou write. The second consequence of Check 21 Act is that it is now possible for anybody—you at home or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n944 \nthe merchant from whom you are buying something—to scan a check and deposit it instantly. “Remote \ndeposit capture” allows users to transmit a scanned image of a check for posting and clearing using a web-\nconnected computer and a check scanner. The user clicks to send the deposit to the desired existing bank \naccount. Many merchants are using this system: that’s why if you write a check at the hardware store you \nmay see it scanned and returned immediately to you. The digital data are transmitted, and the scanned \nimage may be retrieved, if needed, as a “substitute check.” \n \nUCC Article 4: Aspects of Bank Operations \nReason for Article 4 \nOver the years, the states had begun to enact different statutes to regulate the check collection process. \nEighteen states adopted the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code; many others enacted \nDeferred Posting statutes. Not surprisingly, a desire for uniformity was the principal reason for the \nadoption of UCC Article 4. Article 4 absorbed many of the rules of the American Bankers Association Code \nand of the principles of the Deferred Posting statutes, as well as court decisions and common customs not \npreviously codified. \n \nBanks Covered \nArticle 4 covers three types of banks: depository banks, payor banks, and collecting banks. These terms—\nalready mentioned earlier—are defined in UCC Section 4-105. A depositary bank is the first bank to which \nan item is transferred for collection. Section 4-104 defines “item” as “an instrument or a promise or order \nto pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment[,]…not including a credit or debit card slip.” A \npayor bank is any bank that must pay a check because it is drawn on the bank or accepted there—the \ndrawee bank (a depositary bank may also be a payor bank). A collecting bank is any bank except the payor \nbank that handles the item for collection. \n \nTechnical Rules \nDetailed coverage of Parts 2 and 3 of Article 4, the substantive provisions, is beyond the scope of this \nbook. However, Article 4 answers several specific questions that bank customers most frequently ask. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n945 \n1. What is the effect of a “pay any bank” indorsement? The moment these words are indorsed on a \ncheck, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder.

No checks change hands; no paper is written on. It is quiet, odorless, smudge proof. But errors \nare harder to trace than when a paper trail exists, and when the system fails (“our computer is down”) the \nfinancial mess can be colossal. Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows. \n \n1. Proof of transaction. The electronic terminal itself must be equipped to provide a receipt of transfer, \nshowing date, amount, account number, and certain other information. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe bank or other financial institution must provide you with a monthly statement listing all \nelectronic transfers to and from the account, including transactions made over the computer or \ntelephone, and must show to whom payment has been made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n954 \n2. Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation.",

The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation. \n3. Recourse for loss or theft. If you notify the issuer of your EFT card within two business days after \nlearning that your card (or code number) is missing or stolen, your liability is limited to $50. If you \nfail to notify the issuer in this time, your liability can go as high as $500. More daunting is the \nprospect of loss if you fail within sixty days to notify the financial institution of an unauthorized \ntransfer noted on your statement: after sixty days of receipt, your liability is unlimited. In other \nwords, a thief thereafter could withdraw all your funds and use up your line of credit and you would \nhave no recourse against the financial institution for funds withdrawn after the sixtieth day, if you \nfailed to notify it of the unauthorized transfer. \n4. Mandatory use of EFT. Your employer or a government agency can compel you to accept a salary \npayment or government benefit by electronic transfer. But no creditor can insist that you repay \noutstanding loans or pay off other extensions of credit electronically. The act prohibits a financial \ninstitution from sending you an EFT card “valid for use” unless you specifically request one or it is \nreplacing or renewing an expired card. The act also requires the financial institution to provide you \nwith specific information concerning your rights and responsibilities (including how to report losses \nand thefts, resolve errors, and stop payment of preauthorized transfers). A financial institution may \nsend you a card that is “not valid for use” and that you alone have the power to validate if you choose \nto do so, after the institution has verified that you are the person for whom the card was intended. \n \n \n \nLiability of the Financial Institution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n955 \nThe financial institution’s failure to make an electronic fund transfer, in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of an account, in the correct amount or in a timely manner when properly instructed to do so \nby the consumer makes it liable for all damages proximately caused to the consumer, except where \n \n1) the consumer’s account has insufficient funds; \n2) the funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting such transfer; \n3) such transfer would exceed an established credit limit; \n4) an electronic terminal has insufficient cash to complete the transaction; or \n5) a circumstance beyond its control, where it exercised reasonable care to prevent such an \noccurrence, or exercised such diligence as the circumstances required. \n \nEnforcement of the Act \nA host of federal regulatory agencies oversees enforcement of the act. These include the Comptroller of the \nCurrency (national banks), Federal Reserve District Bank (state member banks), Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation regional director (nonmember insured banks), Federal Home Loan Bank Board \nsupervisory agent (members of the FHLB system and savings institutions insured by the Federal Savings \n& Loan Insurance Corporation), National Credit Union Administration (federal credit unions), Securities \n& Exchange Commission (brokers and dealers), and the Federal Trade Commission (retail and \ndepartment stores) consumer finance companies, all nonbank debit card issuers, and certain other \nfinancial institutions. Additionally, consumers are empowered to sue (individually or as a class) for actual \ndamages caused by any EFT system, plus penalties ranging from $100 to $1,000. Section 23.4 \"Cases\", \nunder “Customer’s Duty to Inspect Bank Statements” (Commerce Bank v. Brown), discusses the bank’s \nliability under the act. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n956 \nEager to reduce paperwork for both themselves and for customers, and to speed up the check collection \nprocess, financial institutions have for thirty years been moving away from paper checks and toward \nelectronic fund transfers. These EFTs are ubiquitous, including ATMs, point-of-sale systems, direct deposits \nand withdrawals and online banking of various kinds. Responding to the need for consumer protection, \nCongress adopted the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, effective in 1978.

                    "answer": "The Electronic Fund Transfer Act provides several rights for consumers. One of the most important rights is the right to stop payment of preauthorized transfers. This means that if a consumer has authorized a financial institution to make regular payments from their account, such as a mortgage or loan payment, they have the right to stop those payments at any time. The consumer must give the financial institution at least three business days' notice before the next payment is due. The financial institution must stop the payment within one business day of receiving the notice. Another important right is the right to receive a periodic statement of the consumer's account. The statement must be mailed or delivered to the consumer at least once every calendar month, or once every two calendar months if the consumer has authorized at least two preauthorized transfers each month. The statement must include the date and amount of each transfer, as well as any fees or charges. The consumer also has the right to receive a written explanation of any error in their account. If the consumer discovers an error, they must notify the financial institution within sixty days. The financial institution must investigate the error and correct it within ten business days. If the error is not corrected, the consumer has the right to dispute the error and have the funds returned to their account."

The Lumber Company “laminated” the two by six-inch boards to \nmake them stronger.

At the subsequent jury trial the court permitted \nMeade to testify, over the Bank’s objections, to the amount of his court costs, attorney fees, and deposition \ncosts associated with this case. The Bank filed motions for directed verdict at the close of Meade’s case \nand at the close of evidence, which the trial court denied. \n \nThe jury returned a general verdict finding the Bank liable to Meade in the amount of $3,800. The Bank \nfiled motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court denied. \nThe Bank now appeals, asserting the following five assignments of error.… \n \nII. \nIn its first assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for \nsummary judgment. Specifically, the Bank asserts that Meade did not issue the stop payment order within \na reasonable time for the Bank to act upon it, and therefore that the trial court should have granted \nsummary judgment in favor of the Bank. \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate only when it has been established: (1) that there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that \nreasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving \nparty. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n967 \n[UCC 4-403(A)] provides that a customer may stop payment on any item drawn on the customer’s \naccount by issuing an order to the bank that describes the item with reasonable certainty and is received \nby the bank “at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before \nany action by the bank with respect to the item.” What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the \nfacts of the case. See Chute v. Bank One of Akron, (1983) [Citation] \n \nIn Chute, Bank One alleged that its customer, Mr. Chute, did not give it a reasonable opportunity to act \nupon his stop payment order when he gave an oral stop payment at one Bank One branch office, and a \ndifferent Bank One branch office paid the check the following day. In ruling that Bank One had a \nreasonable opportunity to act upon Mr. Chute’s order before it paid the check, the court considered the \nteller’s testimony that stop payment orders are entered onto the computer upon receipt, where they are \nvirtually immediately accessible to all Bank One tellers. \n \nIn this case, as in Chute, Meade gave notice one day, and the Bank paid the check the following day. \nAdditionally, in this case, the same branch that took the stop payment order also paid the check. \nMoreover, Evans testified that the Bank’s policy for stop payment orders is to enter them into the \ncomputer immediately, and that Meade’s stop payment order may have shown up on the computer on \nSaturday if she had entered it on Friday. Based on this information, and construing the facts in the light \nmost favorable to Meade, reasonable minds could conclude that Meade provided the Bank with the stop \npayment order within time for the Bank to act upon the stop payment order. Accordingly, we overrule the \nBank’s first assignment of error. \n \nIII. \nIn its second assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in permitting Meade to \ntestify regarding the amount he spent on court costs, attorney fees, and taking depositions. Meade \ncontends that because he incurred these costs as a result of the Bank paying his check over a valid stop \npayment order, the costs are properly recoverable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n968 \nAs a general rule, the costs and expenses of litigation, other than court costs, are not recoverable in an \naction for damages. [Citations] \n \nIn this case, the statute providing for damages, [UCC 4-403(c)], provides that a customer’s recoverable \nloss for a bank’s failure to honor a valid stop payment order “may include damages for dishonor of \nsubsequent items * * *.” The statute does not provide for recouping attorney fees and costs. Meade did not \nallege that the Bank acted in bad faith or that he is entitled to punitive damages. Additionally, although \nMeade argues that the Bank caused him to lose his bargaining power with the Lumber Company, Meade",

            "chunk": "Union Planters appeals. \n \nDiscussion \n…II. Whether Rogers’ Delay in Detecting the Forgeries Barred Suit against Union Planters. \n \nThe relationship between Rogers and Union Planters is governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial \nCode. [UCC] 4-406(a) and (c) provide that a bank customer has a duty to discover and report \n“unauthorized signatures”; i.e., forgeries. [The section] reflects an underlying policy decision that furthers \nthe UCC’s “objective of promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.” The UCC \nfacilitates financial transactions, benefiting both consumers and financial institutions, by allocating \nresponsibility among the parties according to whomever is best able to prevent a loss. Because the \ncustomer is more familiar with his own signature, and should know whether or not he authorized a \nparticular withdrawal or check, he can prevent further unauthorized activity better than a financial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n973 \ninstitution which may process thousands of transactions in a single day.…The customer’s duty to exercise \nthis care is triggered when the bank satisfies its burden to provide sufficient information to the customer. \nAs a result, if the bank provides sufficient information, the customer bears the loss when he fails to detect \nand notify the bank about unauthorized transactions. [Citation] \n \nA. Union Planters’ Duty to Provide Information under 4-406(a). \nThe court admitted into evidence copies of all Union Planters statements sent to Rogers during the \nrelevant time period. Enclosed with the bank statements were either the cancelled checks themselves or \ncopies of the checks relating to the period of time of each statement. The evidence shows that all bank \nstatements and cancelled checks were sent, via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at \ntheir “designated address” each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary. We therefore find \nthat the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers and that the remaining \nprovisions of 4-406 are applicable to the case at bar.… \nIn defense of her failure to inspect the bank statements, Rogers claims that she never received the bank \nstatements and cancelled checks. Even if this allegation is true, [2] it does not excuse Rogers from failing to \nfulfill her duties under 4-406(a) & (c) because the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in \nproviding the necessary information to a customer when it “sends…to a customer a statement of account \nshowing payment of items.”…The word “receive” is absent. The customer’s duty to inspect and report does \nnot arise when the statement is received, as Rogers claims; the customer’s duty to inspect and report \narises when the bank sends the statement to the customer’s address. A reasonable person who has not \nreceived a monthly statement from the bank would promptly ask the bank for a copy of the statement. \nHere, Rogers claims that she did not receive numerous statements. We find that she failed to act \nreasonably when she failed to take any action to replace the missing statements. \n \nB. Rogers’ Duty to Report the Forgeries under 4-406(d). \n[Under UCC 4-406] a customer who has not promptly notified a bank of an irregularity may be precluded \nfrom bringing certain claims against the bank: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n974 \n“(d) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties \nimposed on the customer by subsection (c), the customer is precluded from asserting against the \nbank: \n(1) The customer’s unauthorized signature…on the item,… \n \nAlso, when there is a series of forgeries, 406(d)(2) places additional duties on the customer, [who is \nprecluded from asserting against the bank]: \n \n(2) The customer’s unauthorized signature…by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in \ngood faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the \ncustomer of the unauthorized signature…and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable \nperiod of time, not exceeding thirty (30) days, in which to examine the item or statement of \naccount and notify the bank. \nAlthough there is no mention of a specific date, Rogers testified that she and her son began looking for the \nstatements in late May or early June of 2001, after her husband had died.…When they discovered that \nstatements were missing, they notified Union Planters in June of 2001 to replace the statements. At this \ntime, no mention of possible forgery was made, even though Neal, Jr., thought that “something was \nwrong.” In fact, Neal, Jr., had felt that something was wrong as far back as December of 2000, but failed \nto do anything.

Procedural Posture \nPlaintiff, Commerce Bank/Delaware North America (“Commerce”) initially filed a civil complaint against \ndefendant Natasha J. Brown (“Brown”) on October 28, 2005. Commerce seeks judgment in the amount of \n$4.020.11 plus costs and interest and alleges that Brown maintained a checking account with Commerce \nand has been unjustly enriched by $4,020.11.… \n \nThe defendant, Brown…denied all allegations of the complaint. As an affirmative defense Brown claims \nthe transaction for which plaintiff seeks to recover a money judgment were made by means of an ATM \nMachine using a debit card issued by the defendant. On January 16, 2005 Brown asserts that she became \naware of the fraudulent transactions and timely informed the plaintiff of the facts on January 16, 2005. \nBrown asserts that she also requested Commerce in her answer to investigate the matter and to close her \naccount. Based upon these facts, Brown asserts a maximum liability on her own part from $50.00 to \n$500.00 in accordance with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) 15 U.S.C. § 1693(g) and regulation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n976 \n(e), 12 CFR 205.6.

The Facts \nBrown was the only witness called at trial. Brown is twenty-seven years old and has been employed by \nWilmington Trust as an Administrative Assistant for the past three years. Brown previously opened a \nchecking account with Commerce and was issued a debit/ATM card by Commerce which was in her \npossession in December 2004.

The “Description of Claim” indicates as follows: \n \nCustomer came into speak with a CSR “Carla Bernard” on January 16, 2005 to report her card \nloss. At this time her account was only showing a negative $50.00 balance. She told Ms. Bernard \nthat this was not her transaction and to please close this account. Ms. Bernard said that she \nwould do this and that there would be an investigation on the unauthorized transactions. It was \nat this time also that she had Ms. Bernard change her address. In the meantime, several \ntransactions posted to the account causing a balance of negative $3,948.11 and this amount has \nsince been charged off on 1/27/05. Natasha Brown never received any notification of this until \nshe received a letter from one of our collection agencies. She is now here to get this resolved. \n \nOn the back of defendant’s Exhibit No.: 1 were 26 separate unauthorized transactions at different \nmercantile establishments detailing debits with the pin number used on Brown’s debit card charged to \nCommerce Bank. The first charge was $501.75 on January 13, 2005.…Brown asserts at trial that she \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n977 \ntherefore timely gave notice to Commerce to investigate and requested Commerce to close the debit \nchecking account on January 16, 2005. \n \nAt trial Brown also testified she “never heard” from Commerce again until she received a letter in \nDecember 2005 citing a $4,000.00 deficiency balance.… \n \nOn cross-examination Brown testified she received a PIN number from Commerce and “gave the PIN \nnumber to no other person.” In December 2004 she resided with Charles Williams, who is now her \nhusband. Brown testified on cross-examination that she was the only person authorized as a PIN user and \nno one else knew of the card, ‘used the card,’ or was provided orally or in writing of the PIN number. \nBrown spoke with Carla Bernard at the Commerce Bank at the Talleyville branch. Although Brown did not \ninitially fill out a formal report, she did visit Commerce on January 16, 2005 the Talleyville branch and \nchanged her address with Carla. Brown does not recall the last time she ever received a statement from \nCommerce Bank on her checking account. Brown made no further purchases with the account and she \nwas unaware of all the “incidents of unauthorized debit charges on her checking account” until she was \nactually sued by Commerce Bank in the Court of Common Pleas. \n \nIII.

First, several statutes are especially important \nwhen a consumer enters into a credit transaction. These include laws that regulate credit costs, the credit \napplication, and the applicant’s right to check a credit record. Second, after a consumer has contracted for \ncredit, certain statutes give a consumer the right to cancel the contract and correct billing mistakes. Third, \nif the consumer fails to pay a debt, the creditor has several traditional debt collection remedies that today \nare tightly regulated by the government. \n \n  \n \n[1] Ben Woolsey and Matt Schulz, Credit Card Statistics, Industry Statistics, Debt Statistics,August 24, \n2010, http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php. \nThis is “calculated by dividing the total revolving debt in the U.S. ($852.6 billion as of March 2010 data, as listed in \nthe Federal Reserve’s May 2010 report on consumer credit) by the estimated number of households carrying \ncredit card debt (54 million).” \n[2] Deborah Fowles, “Your Monthly Credit Card Minimum Payments May Double,” About.com Financial \nPlanning,http://financialplan.about.com/od/creditcarddebt/a/CCMinimums.htm. \n[3] Index Credit Cards, Credit Card Debt, February 9, 2010,http://www.indexcreditcards.com/creditcarddebt. \n[4] Liz Pulliam Weston, “The Big Lie about Credit Card Debt,” MSN Money, July 30, 2007. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n24.1 Entering into a Credit Transaction \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n987 \n1.

Recognize that there are laws prohibiting discrimination in credit granting. \n4. Understand how consumers’ credit records are maintained and may be corrected. \n \n \nThe Cost of Credit \nLenders, whether banks or retailers, are not free to charge whatever they wish for credit. Usury laws \nestablish a maximum rate of lawful interest. The penalties for violating usury laws vary from state to state. \nThe heaviest penalties are loss of both principal and interest, or loss of a multiple of the interest the \ncreditor charged. The courts often interpret these laws stringently, so that even if the impetus for a \nusurious loan comes from the borrower, the contract can be avoided, as demonstrated in Matter of Dane’s \nEstate (Section 24.3 \"Cases\"). \n \nSome states have eliminated interest rate limits altogether. In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule. Here \nare some common exceptions: \n \n• \nBusiness loans. In many states, businesses may be charged any interest rate, although some states \nlimit this exception to incorporated businesses. \n• \nMortgage loans. Mortgage loans are often subject to special usury laws. The allowable interest \nrates vary, depending on whether a first mortgage or a subordinate mortgage is given, or whether \nthe loan is insured or provided by a federal agency, among other variables. \n• \nSecond mortgages and home equity loans by licensed consumer loan companies. \n• \nCredit card and other retail installment debt. The interest rate for these is governed by the law of \nthe state where the credit card company does business. (That’s why the giant Citibank, otherwise \nheadquartered in New York City, runs its credit card division out of South Dakota, which has no \nusury laws for credit cards.) \n• \nConsumer leasing. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n988 \n• \n“Small loans” such as payday loans and pawnshop loans. \n• \nLease-purchases on personal property.

Moreover, certain charges are not considered interest, such as fees to record \ndocuments in a public office and charges for services such as title examinations, deed preparation, credit \nreports, appraisals, and loan processing. But a creditor may not use these devices to cloak what is in fact a \nusurious bargain; it is not the form but the substance of the agreement that controls. \n \nAs suggested, part of the difficulty here is that governments at all levels have for a generation attempted to \npromote consumption to promote production; production is required to maintain politically acceptable \nlevels of employment. If consumers can get what they want on credit, consumerism increases. Also, \ncertainly, tight limits on interest rates cause creditors to deny credit to the less creditworthy, which may \nnot be helpful to the lower classes. That’s the rationale for the usury exceptions related to pawnshop and \npayday loans. \n \n \nDisclosure of Credit Costs \nSetting limits on what credit costs—as usury laws do—is one thing. Disclosing the cost of credit is another. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act \nUntil 1969, lenders were generally free to disclose the cost of money loaned or credit extended in any way \nthey saw fit—and they did. Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why? Because with the first loan you will have the use of the full \n$1,000 for the entire year; with the second, for much less than the year because you must begin repaying \npart of the principal within a month. In fact, with the second loan you will have use of only about half the \nmoney for the entire year, and so the actual rate of interest is closer to 15 percent. Things become more \ncomplex when interest is compounded and stated as a monthly figure, when different rates apply to \nvarious portions of the loan, and when processing charges and other fees are stated separately. The act \nregulates open-end credit (revolving credit, like charge cards) and closed-end credit (like a car loan—\nextending for a specific period), and—as amended later—it regulates consumer leases and credit card \ntransactions, too. \nFigure 24.1 Credit Disclosure Form \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n990 \n \n \nBy requiring that the finance charge and the annual percentage rate be disclosed on a uniform basis, the \nTILA makes understanding and comparison of loans much easier. The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are",

After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check. And somebody who knows another person’s \ncreditworthiness has what is usually considered confidential information, the possession of which is \nsubject to abuse, and thus regulation. \n \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThrough the 1960s, banks and other lending and credit-granting institutions regularly discriminated \nagainst women. Banks told single women to find a cosigner for loans. Divorced women discovered that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n993 \nthey could not open store charge accounts because they lacked a prior credit history, even though they had \ncontributed to the family income on which previous accounts had been based. Married couples found that \nthe wife’s earnings were not counted when they sought credit; indeed, families planning to buy homes \nwere occasionally even told that the bank would grant a mortgage if the wife would submit to a \nhysterectomy! In all these cases, the premise of the refusal to treat women equally was the unstated—and \nusually false—belief that women would quit work to have children or simply to stay home. \n \nBy the 1970s, as women became a major factor in the labor force, Congress reacted to the manifest \nunfairness of the discrimination by enacting (as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974. The act prohibits any creditor from discriminating “against any \napplicant on the basis of sex or marital status with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction.” In 1976, \nCongress broadened the law to bar discrimination (1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, \nand age; (2) because all or a part of an applicant’s income is from a public assistance program; or (3) \nbecause an applicant has exercised his or her rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. \n \nUnder the ECOA, a creditor may not ask a credit applicant to state sex, race, national origin, or religion. \nAnd unless the applicant is seeking a joint loan or account or lives in a community-property state, the \ncreditor may not ask for a statement of marital status or, if you have voluntarily disclosed that you are \nmarried, for information about your spouse, nor may one spouse be required to cosign if the other is \ndeemed independently creditworthy. All questions concerning plans for children are improper. In \nassessing the creditworthiness of an applicant, the creditor must consider all sources of income, including \nregularly received alimony and child support payments. And if credit is refused, the creditor must, on \ndemand, tell you the specific reasons for rejection. See Rosa v. Park West Bank & Trust Co. in Section \n24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving the ECOA. \n \nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 1975, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), 1977, get at \nanother type of discrimination: redlining.

Errors \ncan include charges not incurred or those billed with the wrong description, charges for goods never \ndelivered, accounting or arithmetic errors, failure to credit payments or returns, and even charges for \nwhich you simply request additional information, including proof of sale. During the time the creditor is \nreplying, you need not pay the questioned item or any finance charge on the disputed amount. \n \nThe creditor has thirty days to respond and ninety days to correct your account or explain why your belief \nthat an error has been committed is incorrect. If you do turn out to be wrong, the creditor is entitled to all \nback finance charges and to prompt payment of the disputed amount. If you persist in disagreeing and \nnotify the creditor within ten days, it is obligated to tell all credit bureaus to whom it sends notices of \ndelinquency that the bill continues to be disputed and to tell you to whom such reports have been sent; \nwhen the dispute has been settled, the creditor must notify the credit bureaus of this fact. Failure of the \ncreditor to follow the rules, an explanation of which must be provided to each customer every six months \nand when a dispute arises, bars it from collecting the first fifty dollars in dispute, plus finance charges, \neven if the creditor turns out to be correct. \n \nDisputes about the Quality of Goods or Services Purchased \nWhile disputes over the quality of goods are not “billing errors,” the act does apply to unsatisfactory goods \nor services purchased by credit card (except for store credit cards); the customer may assert against the \ncredit card company any claims or defenses he or she may have against the seller. This means that under \ncertain circumstances, the customer may withhold payments without incurring additional finance \ncharges. However, this right is subject to three limitations: (1) the value of the goods or services charged \nmust be in excess of fifty dollars, (2) the goods or services must have been purchased either in the home \nstate or within one hundred miles of the customer’s current mailing address, and (3) the consumer must \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n999 \nmake a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute before refusing to pay. If the consumer does refuse to pay, \nthe credit card company would acquiesce: it would credit her account for the disputed amount, pass the \nloss down to the merchant’s bank, and that bank would debit the merchant’s account. The merchant \nwould then have to deal with the consumer directly. \n \n \nDebt Collection Practices \nBanks, financial institutions, and retailers have different incentives for extending credit—for some, a loan \nis simply a means of making money, and for others, it is an inducement to buyers. But in either case, \ncredit is a risk because the consumer may default; the creditor needs a means of collecting when the \ncustomer fails to pay. Open-end credit is usually given without collateral. The creditor can, of course, sue, \nbut if the consumer has no assets, collection can be troublesome. Historically, three different means of \nrecovering the debt have evolved: garnishment, wage assignment, and confession of judgment. \n \nGarnishment \nGarnishment is a legal process by which a creditor obtains a court order directing the debtor’s employer \n(or any party who owes money to the debtor) to pay directly to the creditor a certain portion of the \nemployee’s wages until the debt is paid. Until 1970, garnishment was regulated by state law, and its effects \ncould be devastating—in some cases, even leading to suicide. In 1970, Title III of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act asserted federal control over garnishment proceedings for the first time. The federal wage-\ngarnishment law limits the amount of employee earnings that may be withheld in any one pay date to the \nlesser of 25 percent of disposable (after-tax) earnings or the amount by which disposable weekly earnings \nexceed thirty times the highest current federal minimum wage. The federal law covers everyone who \nreceives personal earnings, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and retirement income \n(though not tips), but it allows courts to garnish above the federal maximum in cases involving support \npayments (e.g., alimony), in personal bankruptcy cases, and in cases where the debt owed is for state or \nfederal tax. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1000 \nThe federal wage-garnishment law also prohibits an employer from firing any worker solely because the \nworker’s pay has been garnished for one debt (multiple garnishments may be grounds for discharge). The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places",

The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought. In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional. [2] \n \nWage Assignment \nA wage assignment is an agreement by an employee that a creditor may take future wages as security \nfor a loan or to pay an existing debt. With a wage assignment, the creditor can collect directly from the \nemployer. However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977. \n \nThis law regulates the manner by which third-party collection agencies conduct their business. It covers \ncollection of all personal, family, and household debts by collection agencies. It does not deal with \ncollection by creditors themselves; the consumer’s remedy for abusive debt collection by the creditor is in \ntort law. \n \nUnder the FDCPA, the third-party collector may contact the debtor only during reasonable hours and not \nat work if the debtor’s employer prohibits it. The debtor may write the collector to cease contact, in which \ncase the agency is prohibited from further contact (except to confirm that there will be no further contact). \nA written denial that money is owed stops the bill collector for thirty days, and he can resume again only \nafter the debtor is sent proof of the debt. Collectors may no longer file suit in remote places, hoping for \ndefault judgments; any suit must be filed in a court where the debtor lives or where the underlying \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1002",

She notes that Mr. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1011 \nAnthony did not have custody of Meghan Rodgers and that an award of child support had not even been \nset at the time Ms. McCullough obtained her consumer report. \n \nDefendants maintain that Ms. McCullough obtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report for a permissible \npurpose, namely to locate Ms. Rodgers’ residence and set and collect child support obligations. \nDefendants argue that 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(a)(3)(A) permits the use of a credit report in connection with \n“collection of an account” and, therefore, Ms. McCullough was permitted to use Ms. Rodgers’ credit report \nin connection with the collection of child support. [1] \n \nThe cases Defendants have cited in response to the motion for summary judgment are inapplicable to the \npresent facts. In each case cited by Defendants, the person who obtained a credit report did so in order to \ncollect on an outstanding judgment or an outstanding debt. See, e.g., [Citation] (finding that collection of \na judgment of arrears in child support is a permissible purpose under [the act]; [Citation] (holding that \ndefendant had a permissible purpose for obtaining a consumer report where plaintiff owed an \noutstanding debt to the company). \n \nHowever, no such outstanding debt or judgment existed in this case. At the time Ms. McCullough \nobtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report, Ms. Rodgers’ did not owe money to either Ms. McCullough or her \nclient, Mr. Anthony. Defendants have provided no evidence showing that Ms. McCullough believed Ms. \nRodgers owed money to Mr. Anthony at the time she requested the credit report. Indeed, Mr. Anthony \nhad not even been awarded custody of Meghan Rodgers at the time Ms. McCullough obtained and used \nthe credit report. Ms. McCullough acknowledged each of the facts during her deposition. Moreover, in \nresponse to Plaintiff’s request for admissions, Ms. McCullough admitted that she did not receive the credit \nreport for the purpose of collecting on an account from Ms. Rodgers. \n \nThe evidence before the Court makes clear that Ms. McCullough was actually attempting, on behalf of Mr. \nAnthony, to secure custody of Meghan Rodgers and obtain a future award of child support payments from \nMs. Rodgers by portraying Ms. Rodgers as irresponsible to the court. These are not listed as permissible \npurposes under [FCRA]. Defendants have offered the Court no reason to depart from the plain language \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1012 \nof the statute, which clearly does not permit an individual to obtain a consumer report for the purposes of \nobtaining child custody and instituting child support payments. Moreover, the fact that the Juvenile Court \nlater awarded custody and child support to Mr. Anthony does not retroactively provide Ms. McCullough \nwith a permissible purpose for obtaining Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report.

The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure of credit \nterms; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits certain types of discrimination in the granting of credit; \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act gives consumers access to their credit dossiers and prohibits unapproved \nuse of credit-rating information. After entering into a credit transaction, a consumer has certain \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1015 \ncancellation rights and may use a procedure prescribed by the Fair Credit Billing Act to correct billing \nerrors. Traditional debt collection practices—garnishment, wage assignments, and confession of judgment \nclauses—are now subject to federal regulation, as are the practices of collection agencies under the Fair \nDebt Collection Practices Act. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Carlene Consumer entered into an agreement with Rent to Buy, Inc., to rent a computer for $20 per week. \nThe agreement also provided that if Carlene chose to rent the computer for fifty consecutive weeks, she \nwould own it. She then asserted that the agreement was not a lease but a sale on credit subject to the \nTruth in Lending Act, and that Rent to Buy, Inc., violated the act by failing to state the annual percentage \nrate. Is Carlene correct? \n2. Carlos, a resident of Chicago, was on a road trip to California when he heard a noise under the hood of his \ncar. He took the car to a mechanic for repair. The mechanic overhauled the power steering unit and billed \nCarlos $600, which he charged on his credit card. Later that day—Carlos having driven about fifty miles—\nthe car made the same noise, and Carlos took it to another mechanic, who diagnosed the problem as a \nloose exhaust pipe connection at the manifold. Carlos was billed $300 for this repair, with which he was \nsatisfied. Carlos returned to Chicago and examined his credit card statement. What rights has he as to the \n$600 charge on his card? \n3. Ken was the owner of Scrimshaw, a company that manufactured and sold carvings made on fossilized ivory. \nHe applied for a loan from Bank. Bank found him creditworthy, but seeking additional security for \nrepayment, it required his wife, Linda, to sign a guaranty as well. During a subsequent recession, demand \nfor scrimshaw fell, and Ken’s business went under. Bank filed suit against both Ken and Linda. What defense \nhas Linda? \n4. The FCRA requires that credit-reporting agencies “follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum \npossible accuracy of the information.” In October of 1989, Renie Guimond became aware of, and notified \nthe credit bureau Trans Union about, inaccuracies in her credit report: that she was married (and it listed a \nSocial Security number for this nonexistent spouse), that she was also known as Ruth Guimond, and that \nshe had a Saks Fifth Avenue credit card.

But in March of 1990, Trans Union again \npublished the erroneous information it purportedly had removed. Guimond then requested the source of \nthe erroneous information, to which Trans Union responded that it could not disclose the identity of the \nsource because it did not know its source. The disputed information was eventually removed from \nGuimond’s file in October 1990. When Guimond sued, Trans Union defended that she had no claim because \nno credit was denied to her as a result of the inaccuracies in her credit file. The lower court dismissed her \ncase; she appealed. To what damages, if any, is Guimond entitled? \n5. Plaintiff incurred a medical debt of $160.

In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, \nyou’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might \nmake: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you \ndefault), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet \nring.

A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book. \nWhether a transaction is a lease or a PMSI is an issue that frequently arises. The answer depends on the \nfacts of each case. However, a security interest is created if (1) the lessee is obligated to continue payments \nfor the term of the lease; (2) the lessee cannot terminate the obligation; and (3) one of several economic \ntests, which are listed in UCC Section 1-201 (37), is met. For example, one of the economic tests is that \n“the lessee has an option to become owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal \nadditional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.” \n \nThe issue of lease versus security interest gets litigated because of the requirements of Article 9 that a \nsecurity interest be perfected in certain ways (as we will see).

Under the terms of the lease, Millie’s must pay a yearly rental of $5,000 for five years, \nafter which time Millie’s may take title to the machine outright for the payment of $1. During the period of \nthe rental, title remains in Ferrous Brothers. Is this “lease” really a security interest? Since ownership \ncomes at nominal charge when the entire lease is satisfied, the transaction would be construed as one \ncreating a security interest. What difference does this make? Suppose Millie’s goes bankrupt in the third \nyear of the lease, and the trustee in bankruptcy wishes to sell the punch press to satisfy debts of the \nmachine shop. If it were a true lease, Ferrous Brothers would be entitled to reclaim the machine (unless \nthe trustee assumed the lease). But if the lease is really intended as a device to create a security interest, \nthen Ferrous Brothers can recover its collateral only if it has otherwise complied with the obligations of \nArticle 9—for example, by recording its security interest, as we will see. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1023 \nNow we return to definitions. \n \nDebtor is “a person (1) having an interest in the collateral other than a security interest or a lien; (2) a \nseller of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; or (3) a consignee.” [4] \nObligor is “a person that, with respect to an obligation secured by a security interest in or an agricultural \nlien on the collateral, (i) owes payment or other performance of the obligation, (ii) has provided property \nother than the collateral to secure payment or other performance of the obligation, or (iii) is otherwise \naccountable in whole or in part for payment or other performance of the obligation.” [5] Here is example 1 \nfrom the Official Comment to UCC Section 9-102: “Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security \ninterest in her Miata to secure the debt. Behnfeldt is a debtor and an obligor.” \n \nBehnfeldt is a debtor because she has an interest in the car—she owns it. She is an obligor because she \nowes payment to the creditor. Usually the debtor is the obligor. \n \nA secondary obligor is “an obligor to the extent that: (A) [the] obligation is secondary; or (b) [the person] \nhas a right of recourse with respect to an obligation secured by collateral against the debtor, another \nobligor, or property of either.” [6] The secondary obligor is a guarantor (surety) of the debt, obligated to \nperform if the primary obligor defaults. Consider example 2 from the Official Comment to Section 9-102: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security interest in her Miata to secure the debt. Bruno cosigns a \nnegotiable note as maker. As before, Behnfeldt is the debtor and an obligor. As an accommodation party, \nBruno is a secondary obligor. Bruno has this status even if the note states that her obligation is a primary \nobligation and that she waives all suretyship defenses.” \n \nAgain, usually the debtor is the obligor, but consider example 3 from the same Official Comment: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money on an unsecured basis. Bruno cosigns the note and grants a security interest in \nher Honda to secure her [Behnfeldt’s] obligation. Inasmuch as Behnfeldt does not have a property interest",

Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause. The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a \n$700,000 inventory-picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor.

The security \nagreement contains a future advances clause. A few years later, the bank sends the debtor \na credit card. Two years go by: the car is paid for, but the credit card is in default. The \nbank seizes the car. “Whoa!” says the debtor. “I paid for the car.” “Yes,” says the bank, \n“but it was collateral for all future indebtedness you ran up with us. Check out your loan \nagreement with us and UCC Section 9-204(c), especially Comment 5.” \n \nSee Figure 25.2 \"Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral\". \n \n \n \nFigure 25.2 Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1029 \n \n \nAttachment of the Security Interest \nIn General \nAttachment is the term used to describe when a security interest becomes enforceable against the debtor \nwith respect to the collateral. In Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\", ”Attachment” is the outreached hand \nthat is prepared, if the debtor defaults, to grasp the collateral. [21] \n \nRequirements for Attachment \nThere are three requirements for attachment: (1) the secured party gives value; (2) the debtor has rights in \nthe collateral or the power to transfer rights in it to the secured party; (3) the parties have a security \nagreement “authenticated” (signed) by the debtor, or the creditor has possession of the collateral. \n \n \n \nCreditor Gives Value \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1030 \nThe creditor, or secured party, must give “value” for the security interest to attach. The UCC, in Section 1-\n204, provides that \n \na person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them \n \n(1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately \navailable credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in \nthe event of difficulties in collection; or \n \n(2) as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim; or \n \n(3) by accepting delivery pursuant to a pre-existing contract for purchase; or \n \n(4) generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. \n \nSuppose Deborah owes Carl $3,000. She cannot repay the sum when due, so she agrees to give Carl a \nsecurity interest in her automobile to the extent of $3,000 in return for an extension of the time to pay. \nThat is sufficient value. \n \nDebtor’s Rights in Collateral \nThe debtor must have rights in the collateral. Most commonly, the debtor owns the collateral (or has some \nownership interest in it). The rights need not necessarily be the immediate right to possession, but they \nmust be rights that can be conveyed. [22] A person can’t put up as collateral property she doesn’t own. \n \nSecurity Agreement (Contract) or Possession of Collateral by Creditor \nThe debtor most often signs the written security agreement, or contract. The UCC says that “the debtor \n[must have] authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral.…” \n“Authenticating” (or “signing,” “adopting,” or “accepting”) means to sign or, in recognition of electronic \ncommercial transactions, “to execute or otherwise adopt a symbol, or encrypt or similarly process a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1031 \nrecord…with the present intent of the authenticating person to identify the person and adopt or accept a \nrecord.” The “record” is the modern UCC’s substitution for the term “writing.” It includes information \nelectronically stored or on paper. [23] \n \nThe “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common",

In commercial transactions, it would be common \nfor the creditor to have possession of—actually or virtually—certified securities, deposit accounts, \nelectronic chattel paper, investment property, or other such paper or electronic evidence of value. [24] \n \nAgain, Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\" diagrams the attachment, showing the necessary elements: the \ncreditor gives value, the debtor has rights in collateral, and there is a security agreement signed \n(authenticated) by the debtor. If the debtor defaults, the creditor’s “hand” will grab (repossess) the \ncollateral. \n \nPerfection of the Security Interest \nAs between the debtor and the creditor, attachment is fine: if the debtor defaults, the creditor will \nrepossess the goods and—usually—sell them to satisfy the outstanding obligation. But unless an additional \nset of steps is taken, the rights of the secured party might be subordinated to the rights of other secured \nparties, certain lien creditors, bankruptcy trustees, and buyers who give value and who do not know of the \nsecurity interest. Perfection is the secured party’s way of announcing the security interest to the rest of \nthe world. It is the secured party’s claim on the collateral. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1032 \nThere are five ways a creditor may perfect a security interest: (1) by filing a financing statement, (2) by \ntaking or retaining possession of the collateral, (3) by taking control of the collateral, (4) by taking control \ntemporarily as specified by the UCC, or (5) by taking control automatically. \n \nPerfection by Filing \n“Except as otherwise provided…a financing statement must be filed to perfect all security agreements.” [25] \n \nThe Financing Statement \nA financing statement is a simple notice showing the creditor’s general interest in the collateral. It is \nwhat’s filed to establish the creditor’s “dibs.” \n \nContents of the Financing Statement \nIt may consist of the security agreement itself, as long as it contains the information required by the UCC, \nbut most commonly it is much less detailed than the security agreement: it “indicates merely that a person \nmay have a security interest in the collateral[.]…Further inquiry from the parties concerned will be \nnecessary to disclose the full state of affairs.” [26] The financing statement must provide the following \ninformation: \n \n• \nThe debtor’s name. Financing statements are indexed under the debtor’s name, so getting that \ncorrect is important. Section 9-503 of the UCC describes what is meant by “name of debtor.” \n• \nThe secured party’s name. \n• \nAn “indication” of what collateral is covered by the financing statement.[27] It may describe the \ncollateral or it may “indicate that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal \nproperty” (such generic references are not acceptable in the security agreement but are OK in the \nfinancing statement). [28] If the collateral is real-property-related, covering timber to be cut or \nfixtures, it must include a description of the real property to which the collateral is related. [29] \n \nThe form of the financing statement may vary from state to state, but see Figure 25.3 \"UCC-1 Financing \nStatement\" for a typical financing statement. Minor errors or omissions on the form will not make it \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1033 \nineffective, but the debtor’s signature is required unless the creditor is authorized by the debtor to make \nthe filing without a signature, which facilitates paperless filing. [30] \n \nFigure 25.3 UCC-1 Financing Statement \n \n \nDuration of the Financing Statement \nGenerally, the financing statement is effective for five years; a continuation statement may be filed \nwithin six months before the five-year expiration date, and it is good for another five \nyears. [31] Manufactured-home filings are good for thirty years. When the debtor’s obligation is satisfied, \nthe secured party files a termination statement if the collateral was consumer goods; otherwise—upon \ndemand—the secured party sends the debtor a termination statement.

Generally, an interest \nremains perfected until the earlier of when the perfection would have expired or for four months after the \ndebtor moves to a new jurisdiction. [33] \n \nWhere to File the Financing Statement \nFor most real-estate-related filings—ore to be extracted from mines, agricultural collateral, and fixtures—\nthe place to file is with the local office that files mortgages, typically the county auditor’s office. [34] For \nother collateral, the filing place is as duly authorized by the state. In some states, that is the office of the \nSecretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that \nmaintains the state’s filing system. [35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or \nher primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered \norganization. [36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is \nalready encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office \nwill provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available \nfor at least some types of collateral. \n \nExemptions \nSome transactions are exempt from the filing provision. The most important category of exempt collateral \nis that covered by state certificate of title laws. For example, many states require automobile owners to \nobtain a certificate of title from the state motor vehicle office. Most of these states provide that it is not \nnecessary to file a financing statement in order to perfect a security interest in an automobile. The reason \nis that the motor vehicle regulations require any security interests to be stated on the title, so that anyone \nattempting to buy a car in which a security interest had been created would be on notice when he took the \nactual title certificate. [37] \n \nTemporary Perfection \nThe UCC provides that certain types of collateral are automatically perfected but only for a while: “A \nsecurity interest in certificated securities, or negotiable documents, or instruments is perfected without \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1035 \nfiling or the taking of possession for a period of twenty days from the time it attaches to the extent that it \narises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement.”[38] Similar temporary perfection \ncovers negotiable documents or goods in possession of a bailee, and when a security certificate or \ninstrument is delivered to the debtor for sale, exchange, presentation, collection, enforcement, renewal, or \nregistration. [39] After the twenty-day period, perfection would have to be by one of the other methods \nmentioned here. \n \nPerfection by Possession \nA secured party may perfect the security interest by possession where the collateral is negotiable \ndocuments, goods, instruments, money, tangible chattel paper, or certified securities. [40] This is a pledge \nof assets (mentioned in the example of the stamp collection). No security agreement is required for \nperfection by possession. \n \nA variation on the theme of pledge is field warehousing. When the pawnbroker lends money, he takes \npossession of the goods—the watch, the ring, the camera. But when large manufacturing concerns wish to \nborrow against their inventory, taking physical possession is not necessarily so easy. The bank does not \nwish to have shipped to its Wall Street office several tons of copper mined in Colorado. Bank employees \nperhaps could go west to the mine and take physical control of the copper, but banks are unlikely to \nemploy people and equipment necessary to build a warehouse on the spot. Thus this so-called field pledge \nis rare. \n \nMore common is the field warehouse. The field warehouse can take one of two forms. An independent \ncompany can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—\nthus establishing physical control of the collateral. Or the independent company can lease the warehouse \nfacilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody. Either \nway, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service. The field warehouse then \nsegregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to",

            "chunk": "with nothing. Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat. Who has priority? Whoever perfects first: \nthe rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet. Whoever can submit the financing \nstatement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not \ndepend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is claiming a security interest in the \nsame collateral. But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest \nfirst attached has priority? This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC \ncommentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation \nwithout [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, \nneither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee. \n \nTo rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors \nlose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected). If both parties are secured (have attached the \ninterest), the first to perfect wins. [1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins. [2] \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—\nactually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them. \n \nImmediate Exceptions \nWe call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate \npriority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it. They all involve purchase-money \nsecurity interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor \nhad sold the debtor. \n \n(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock). The UCC provides that \n“a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1042 \na conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase-money security interest is perfected \nwhen debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to \nthis UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an \nafter-acquired property clause.” \n \nSuppose Susan manufactures fur coats. On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would",

We will \nexamine some of the possible permutations but are compelled to observe that this area of law has many \nfine nuances, not all of which can be taken up here. \n \nFirst we look at buyers who take priority over, or free of, unperfected security interests. Buyers who take \ndelivery of many types of collateral covered by anunperfected security interest win out over the hapless \nsecured party who failed to perfect if they give value and don’t know of the security interest or agricultural \nlien. [5] A buyer who doesn’t give value or who knows of the security interest will not win out, nor will a \nbuyer prevail if the seller’s creditor files a financing statement before or within twenty days after the \ndebtor receives delivery of the collateral. \n \nNow we look at buyers who take priority over perfected security interests. Sometimes people who buy \nthings even covered by a perfected security interest win out (the perfected secured party loses). \n \n• \nBuyers in the ordinary course of business. “A buyer in the ordinary course of business, other than \n[one buying farm products from somebody engaged in farming] takes free of a security interest \ncreated by the buyer’s seller, even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows \n[it].” [6] Here the buyer is usually purchasing inventory collateral, and it’s OK if he knows the \ninventory is covered by a security interest, but it’s not OK if he knows “that the sale violates a term \nin an agreement with the secured party.” [7] It would not be conducive to faith in commercial \ntransactions if buyers of inventory generally had to worry whether their seller’s creditors were \ngoing to repossess the things the buyers had purchased in good faith. For example (based on \nexample 1 to the same comment, UCC 9-320, Official Comment 3), Manufacturer makes \nappliances and owns manufacturing equipment covered by a perfected security agreement in \nfavor of Lender. Manufacturer sells the equipment to Dealer, whose business is buying and selling \nused equipment; Dealer, in turn, sells the stuff to Buyer, a buyer in the ordinary course. Does \nBuyer take free of the security interest? No, because Dealer didn’t create it; Manufacturer did. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1045 \n• \nBuyers of consumer goods purchased for personal, family, or household use take free of security \ninterests, even if perfected, so long as they buy without knowledge of the security interest, for \nvalue, for their own consumer uses, and before the filing of a financing statement covering the \ngoods. This—again—is the rub when a seller of consumer goods perfects by “mere attachment” \n(automatic perfection) and the buyer of the goods turns around and sells them. For example, Tom \nbuys a new refrigerator from Sears, which perfects by mere attachment. Tom has cash flow \nproblems and sells the fridge to Ned, his neighbor. Ned doesn’t know about Sears’s security \ninterest and pays a reasonable amount for it. He puts it in his kitchen for home use. Sears cannot \nrepossess the fridge from Ned. If it wanted to protect itself fully, Sears would have filed a \nfinancing statement; then Ned would be out the fridge when the repo men came. [8] The “value” \nissue is interestingly presented in the Nicolosi case (Section 25.5 \"Cases\"). \n• \nBuyers of farm products. The UCC itself does not protect buyers of farm products from security \ninterests created by “the person engaged in farming operations who is in the business of selling \nfarm products,” and the result was that sometimes the buyer had to pay twice: once to the farmer \nand again to the lender whom the farmer didn’t pay. As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors",

Persons who become \nlien creditors after the security interest is perfected lose (subject to some nuances in situations where the \nlien arises between attachment by the creditor and the filing, and depending upon the type of security \ninterest and the type of collateral). [9] More straightforwardly, perhaps, a lien securing payment or \nperformance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1046 \nordinary course of business has priority over other security interests (unless a statute provides \notherwise). [10] This is the bailee or “material man” (one who supplies materials, as to build a house) with a \nlien situation. Garage Mechanic repairs a car in which Owner has previously given a perfected security \ninterest to Bank. Owner doesn’t pay Bank. Bank seeks to repossess the car from Mechanic. It will have to \npay the Mechanic first. And why not? If the car was not running, Bank would have to have it repaired \nanyway. \n \nBankruptcy Trustee \nTo what extent can the bankruptcy trustee take property previously encumbered by a security interest? It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does. The rationale: “this…enables banks to extend credit to their depositors without the need to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1047 \nexamine [records] to determine whether another party might have a security interest in the deposit \naccount.” [14] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nWho among competing creditors gets the collateral if the debtor defaults? The general rule on priorities is \nthat the first to secure most completely wins: if all competitors have perfected, the first to do so wins. If one \nhas perfected and the others have not, the one who perfects wins. If all have attached, the first to attach wins. \nIf none have attached, they’re all unsecured creditors. To this general rule there are a number of exceptions. \nPurchase-money security interests in goods and inventory prevail over previously perfected secured parties in \nthe same goods and inventory (subject to some requirements); fixture financers who file properly have \npriority over previously perfected mortgagees.

Know how collateral may be disposed of upon repossession: by sale or by strict foreclosure. \n \nRights of Creditor on Default \nUpon default, the creditor must make an election: to sue, or to repossess. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1049 \n \nResort to Judicial Process \nAfter a debtor’s default (e.g., by missing payments on the debt), the creditor could ignore the security \ninterest and bring suit on the underlying debt. But creditors rarely resort to this remedy because it is time-\nconsuming and costly. Most creditors prefer to repossess the collateral and sell it or retain possession in \nsatisfaction of the debt. \n \nRepossession \nSection 9-609 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) permits the secured party to take possession of the \ncollateral on default (unless the agreement specifies otherwise): \n \n(a) After default, a secured party may (1) take possession of the collateral; and (2) without \nremoval, may render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a debtor’s premises. \n \n(b) A secured party may proceed under subsection (a): (1) pursuant to judicial process; or (2) \nwithout judicial process, if it proceeds without breach of the peace. \n \nThis language has given rise to the flourishing business of professional “repo men” (and women). “Repo” \ncompanies are firms that specialize in repossession collateral. They have trained car-lock pickers, in-\nhouse locksmiths, experienced repossession teams, damage-free towing equipment, and the capacity to \ndeliver repossessed collateral to the client’s desired destination. Some firms advertise that they have 360-\ndegree video cameras that record every aspect of the repossession. They have “skip chasers”—people \nwhose business it is to track down those who skip out on their obligations, and they are trained not to \nbreach the peace. [1] See Pantoja-Cahue v.

Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the \ncompany, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts. The earliest \nsureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee. \nToday most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as \nsuretyship). \n \nA surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by the principal debtor, and, \nstrictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the \nsurety when the debt is due. The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, \nstrictly speaking) owes an obligation. Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up \ncollateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain \nthe creditor is paid or performance is made. For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his \ncorporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000. Bank says, “Okay, Mr. Debtor, we’ll loan the corporation \nmoney, but we want its computer equipment as security, and we want you personally to guarantee the \ndebt if the corporation can’t pay.” Sometimes, though, the surety and the principal debtor may have no \nagreement between each other; the surety might have struck a deal with the creditor to act as surety \nwithout the consent or knowledge of the principal debtor. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1055 \nA guarantor also is one who guarantees an obligation of another, and for practical purposes, \ntherefore, guarantor is usually synonymous with surety—the terms are used pretty much \ninterchangeably. But here’s the technical difference: a surety is usually a party to the original contract and \nsigns her (or his, or its) name to the original agreement along with the surety; the consideration for the \nprincipal’s contract is the same as the surety’s consideration—she is bound on the contract from the very \nstart, and she is also expected to know of the principal debtor’s default so that the creditor’s failure to \ninform her of it does not discharge her of any liability. On the other hand, a guarantor usually does not \nmake his agreement with the creditor at the same time the principal debtor does: it’s a separate contract \nrequiring separate consideration, and if the guarantor is not informed of the principal debtor’s default, the \nguarantor can claim discharge on the obligation to the extent any failure to inform him prejudices him. \nBut, again, as the terms are mostly synonymous, surety is used here to encompass both. \n \nFigure 25.6 Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety \n \n \nTypes of Suretyship \nWhere there is an interest, public or private, that requires protection from the possibility of a default, \nsureties are engaged. For example, a landlord might require that a commercial tenant not only put up a \nsecurity deposit but also show evidence that it has a surety on line ready to stand for three months’ rent if \nthe tenant defaults. Often, a municipal government will want its road contractor to show it has a surety \navailable in case, for some reason, the contractor cannot complete the project. Many states require general \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1056 \ncontractors to have bonds, purchased from insurance companies, as a condition of getting a contractor’s \nlicense; the insurance company is the surety—it will pay out if the contractor fails to complete work on the \nclient’s house. These are types of a performance bond. A judge will often require that a criminal \ndefendant put up a bond guaranteeing his appearance in court—that’s a type of suretyship where the bail-\nbonder is the surety—or that a plaintiff put up a bond indemnifying the defendant for the costs of delays \ncaused by the lawsuit—a judicial bond. A bank will take out a bond on its employees in case they steal \nmoney from the bank—the bank teller, in this case, is the principal debtor (a fidelity bond). However, as \nwe will see, sureties do not anticipate financial loss like insurance companies do: the surety expects, \nmostly, to be repaid if it has to perform. The principal debtor goes to an insurance company and buys the \nbond—the suretyship policy. The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond \napplied for, and the applicant’s financial history. A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 \npercent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent \nand 20 percent of the bond amount. When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s \nmortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee \nreleases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults. \n \nCreation of the Suretyship",

Eva is \nentitled to have the security interest in the car transferred to her. \n \nContribution \nTwo or more sureties who are bound to answer for the principal’s default and who should share between \nthem the loss caused by the default are known as cosureties. A surety who in performing its own \nobligation to the creditor winds up paying more than its proportionate share is entitled to contribution \nfrom the cosureties. \n \n \n \nDefenses of the Parties \nThe principal and the surety may have defenses to paying. \n \nDefenses of the Principal \nThe principal debtor may avail itself of any standard contract defenses as against the creditor, including \nimpossibility, illegality, incapacity, fraud, duress, insolvency, or bankruptcy discharge. However, the \nsurety may contract with the creditor to be liable despite the principal’s defenses, and a surety who has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1059 \nundertaken the suretyship with knowledge of the creditor’s fraud or duress remains obligated, even \nthough the principal debtor will be discharged. When the surety turns to the principal debtor and \ndemands reimbursement, the latter may have defenses against the surety—as noted—for acting in bad \nfaith. \n \nOne of the main reasons creditors want the promise of a surety is to avoid the risk that the principal \ndebtor will go bankrupt: the debtor’s bankruptcy is a defense to the debtor’s liability, certainly, but that \ndefense cannot be used by the surety. The same is true of the debtor’s incapacity: it is a defense available \nto the principal debtor but not to the surety. \n \nDefenses of the Surety \nGenerally, the surety may exercise defenses on a contract that would have been available to the principal \ndebtor (e.g., creditor’s breach; impossibility or illegality of performance; fraud, duress, or \nmisrepresentation by creditor; statute of limitations; refusal of creditor to accept tender or performance \nfrom either debtor or surety.) Beyond that, the surety has some defenses of its own. Common defenses \nraised by sureties include the following: \n \n• \nRelease of the principal. Whenever a creditor releases the principal, the surety is discharged, \nunless the surety consents to remain liable or the creditor expressly reserves her rights against the \nsurety. The creditor’s release of the surety, though, does not release the principal debtor because \nthe debtor is liable without regard to the surety’s liability. \n• \nModification of the contract. If the creditor alters the instrument sufficiently to discharge the \nprincipal, the surety is discharged as well. Likewise, when the creditor and principal modify their \ncontract, a surety who has not consented to the modification is discharged if the surety’s risk is \nmaterially increased (but not if it is decreased). Modifications include extension of the time of \npayment, release of collateral (this releases the surety to the extent of the impairment), change in \nprincipal debtor’s duties, and assignment or delegation of the debtor’s obligations to a third party. \nThe surety may consent to modifications. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1060 \n• \nCreditor’s failure to perfect.

Suretyship contracts are among those required to be evidenced by some writing \nunder the statute of frauds, and failure to do so may discharge the surety from liability. \n• \nCreditor’s failure to inform surety of material facts within creditor’s knowledge affecting \ndebtor’s ability to perform (e.g., that debtor has defaulted several times before). \n• \nGeneral contract defenses. The surety may raise common defenses like incapacity (infancy), lack \nof consideration (unless promissory estoppel can be substituted or unless no separate \nconsideration is necessary because the surety’s and debtor’s obligations arise at the same time), \nand creditor’s fraud or duress on surety. However, fraud by the principal debtor on the surety to \ninduce the suretyship will not release the surety if the creditor extended credit in good faith; if the \ncreditor knows of the fraud perpetrated by the debtor on the surety, the surety may avoid liability. \nSee Figure 25.6 \"Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety\". \n \nThe following are defenses of principal debtor only: \n \n• \nDeath or incapacity of principal debtor \n• \nBankruptcy of principal debtor \n• \nPrincipal debtor’s setoffs against creditor \n \nThe following are defenses of both principal debtor and surety: \n \n• \nMaterial breach by creditor \n• \nLack of mutual assent, failure of consideration \n• \nCreditor’s fraud, duress, or misrepresentation of debtor \n• \nImpossibility or illegality of performance \n•",

Looking to cases in other \njurisdictions, the court determined that, “in general, a mere trespass, standing alone, does not \nautomatically constitute a breach of the peace.” [Citation] (taking possession of car from private driveway \ndoes not, without more, constitute breach of the peace), [Citation] (no breach of the peace occurred where \ncar repossessed from debtor’s driveway without entering “any gates, doors, or other barricades to reach” \ncar), [Citation] (no breach of the peace occurred where car was parked partially under carport and \nundisputed that no door, “not even one to a garage,” on the debtor’s premises was opened, much less \nbroken, to repossess the car), [Citation] (although secured party may not break into or enter homes or \nbuildings or enclosed spaces to effectuate a repossession, repossession of vehicle from parking lot of \ndebtor’s apartment building was not breach of the peace), [Citation] (repossession of car from debtor’s \ndriveway without entering any gates, doors or other barricades was accomplished without breach of the \npeace).… \n \nAlthough the evidence showed the plaintiff notified Chrysler prior to the repossession that it was not \npermitted onto his property, the court held Chrysler’s entry onto the property to take the car did not \nconstitute a breach of the peace because there was no evidence Chrysler entered through a barricade or \ndid anything other than drive the car away. [Citation] “Chrysler enjoyed a limited privilege to enter [the \nplaintiff’s] property for the sole and exclusive purpose of effectuating the repossession. So long as the \nentry was limited in purpose (repossession), and so long as no gates, barricades, doors, enclosures, \nbuildings, or chains were breached or cut, no breach of the peace occurred by virtue of the entry onto his \nproperty.” \n \n…[W]e come to essentially the same conclusion: where a repossession is effectuated by an actual breaking \ninto the lessee/debtor’s premises or breaching or cutting of chains, gates, barricades, doors or other \nbarriers designed to exclude trespassers, the likelihood that a breach of the peace occurred is high. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1069 \nDavenport v. Chrysler Credit Corp., [Citation] (Tenn.App.1991), a case analyzing Tennessee’s version of \nsection 9-503 is particularly helpful, holding that “‘[a] breach of the peace is almost certain to be found if \nthe repossession is accompanied by the unauthorized entry into a closed or locked garage.’”…This is so \nbecause “public policy favors peaceful, non-trespassory repossessions when the secured party has a free \nright of entry” and “forced entries onto the debtor’s property or into the debtor’s premises are viewed as \nseriously detrimental to the ordinary conduct of human affairs.” Davenport held that the creditor’s \nrepossession of a car by entering a closed garage and cutting a chain that would have prevented it from \nremoving the car amounted to a breach of the peace, “[d]espite the absence of violence or physical \nconfrontation” (because the debtor was not at home when the repossession \noccurred).Davenport recognized that the secured creditors’ legitimate interest in obtaining possession of \ncollateral without having to resort to expensive and cumbersome judicial procedures must be balanced \nagainst the debtors’ legitimate interest in being free from unwarranted invasions of their property and \nprivacy interests. \n \n“Repossession is a harsh procedure and is, essentially, a delegation of the State’s exclusive prerogative to \nresolve disputes. Accordingly, the statutes governing the repossession of collateral should be construed in \na way that prevents abuse and discourages illegal conduct which might otherwise go unchallenged \nbecause of the debtor’s lack of knowledge of legally proper repossession techniques” [Citation].",

            "chunk": "loan): a person can take out a mortgage on land to fund a vacation. Indeed, during the period leading up \nto the recession in 2007–08, a lot of people borrowed money on their houses to buy things: boats, new \ncars, furniture, and so on. Unfortunately, it turned out that some of the real estate used as collateral was \novervalued: when the economy weakened and people lost income or their jobs, they couldn’t make the \nmortgage payments. And, to make things worse, the value of the real estate sometimes sank too, so that \nthe debtors owed more on the property than it was worth (that’s called being underwater). They couldn’t \nsell without taking a loss, and they couldn’t make the payments. Some debtors just walked away, leaving \nthe banks with a large number of houses, commercial buildings, and even shopping centers on their \nhands. \n \nShort History of Mortgage Law \nThe mortgage has ancient roots, but the form we know evolved from the English land law in the Middle \nAges. Understanding that law helps to understand modern mortgage law. In the fourteenth century, the \nmortgage was a deed that actually transferred title to the mortgagee. If desired, the mortgagee could move \ninto the house, occupy the property, or rent it out. But because the mortgage obligated him to apply to the \nmortgage debt whatever rents he collected, he seldom ousted the mortgagor. Moreover, the mortgage set a \nspecific date (the “law day”) on which the debt was to be repaid. If the mortgagor did so, the mortgage \nbecame void and the mortgagor was entitled to recover the property. If the mortgagor failed to pay the \ndebt, the property automatically vested in the mortgagee. No further proceedings were necessary. \nThis law was severe. A day’s delay in paying the debt, for any reason, forfeited the land, and the courts \nstrictly enforced the mortgage. The only possible relief was a petition to the king, who over time referred \nthese and other kinds of petitions to the courts of equity. At first fitfully, and then as a matter of course \n(by the seventeenth century), the equity courts would order the mortgagee to return the land when the \nmortgagor stood ready to pay the debt plus interest. Thus a new right developed: the equitable right of \nredemption, known for short as the equity of redemption. In time, the courts held that this equity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1082 \nredemption was a form of property right; it could be sold and inherited. This was a powerful right: no \nmatter how many years later, the mortgagor could always recover his land by proffering a sum of money. \n \nUnderstandably, mortgagees did not warm to this interpretation of the law, because their property rights \nwere rendered insecure. They tried to defeat the equity of redemption by having mortgagors waive and \nsurrender it to the mortgagees, but the courts voided waiver clauses as a violation of public policy. Hence \na mortgage, once a transfer of title, became a security for debt. A mortgage as such can never be converted \ninto a deed of title. \n \nThe law did not rest there. Mortgagees won a measure of relief in the development of the foreclosure. \nOn default, the mortgagee would seek a court order giving the mortgagor a fixed time—perhaps six \nmonths or a year—within which to pay off the debt; under the court decree, failure meant that the \nmortgagor was forever foreclosed from asserting his right of redemption. This strict foreclosure gave \nthe mortgagee outright title at the end of the time period. \n \nIn the United States today, most jurisdictions follow a somewhat different approach: the mortgagee \nforecloses by forcing a public sale at auction. Proceeds up to the amount of the debt are the mortgagee’s to \nkeep; surplus is paid over to the mortgagor. Foreclosure by sale is the usual procedure in the United \nStates. At bottom, its theory is that a mortgage is a lien on land. (Foreclosure issues are further discussed \nin Section 26.2 \"Priority, Termination of the Mortgage, and Other Methods of Using Real Estate as \nSecurity\".) \nUnder statutes enacted in many states, the mortgagor has one last chance to recover his property, even \nafter foreclosure. This statutory right of redemption extends the period to repay, often by one year. \n \nCreation of the Mortgage \nStatutory Regulation \nThe decision whether to lend money and take a mortgage is affected by several federal and state \nregulations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1083 \nConsumer Credit Statutes Apply \nStatutes dealing with consumer credit transactions (as discussed in Chapter 24 \"Consumer Credit \nTransactions\") have a bearing on the mortgage, including state usury statutes, and the federal Truth in \nLending Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. \n \nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act \nOther federal statutes are directed more specifically at mortgage lending.

Should the borrower have misplaced the canceled notes or failed to keep good records, \nhe will need to procure a surety bond to protect the trustee in case of a mistake. This can be an expensive \nprocedure. In many jurisdictions, the mortgage holder is prohibited from seeking a deficiency judgment if \nthe holder chooses to sell the property through nonjudicial means. \n \nAlpha Imperial Building, LLC v. Schnitzer Family Investment, LLC, Section 26.4 \"Cases\", discusses \nseveral issues involving deeds of trust. \n \nInstallment or Land Contract \nUnder the installment contract or land contract, the purchaser takes possession and agrees to pay \nthe seller over a period of years. Until the final payment, title belongs to the seller. The contract will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1093 \nspecify the type of deed to be conveyed at closing, the terms of payment, the buyer’s duty to pay taxes and \ninsure the premises, and the seller’s right to accelerate on default. The buyer’s particular concern in this \ntype of sale is whether the seller in fact has title. The buyers can protect themselves by requiring proof of \ntitle and title insurance when the contract is signed. Moreover, the buyer should record the installment \ncontract to protect against the seller’s attempt to convey title to an innocent third-party purchaser while \nthe contract is in effect. \n \nThe benefit to the land contract is that the borrower need not bank-qualify, so the pool of available buyers \nis larger, and buyers who have inadequate resources at the time of contracting but who have the \nexpectation of a rising income in the future are good candidates for the land contract. Also, the seller gets \nall the interest paid by the buyer, instead of the bank getting it in the usual mortgage. The obvious \ndisadvantage from the seller’s point is that she will not get a big lump sum immediately: the payments \ntrickle in over years (unless she can sell the contract to a third party, but that would be at a discount). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe general rule on priority in real property security is that the first creditor to record its interest prevails over \nsubsequent creditors. There are some exceptions; the most familiar is that the seller of a fixture on a \npurchase-money security interest has priority over a previously recorded mortgagee. The mortgage will \nterminate by payment, assumption by a new buyer (with a novation releasing the old buyer), and foreclosure. \nIn a judicial-sale foreclosure, a court authorizes the property’s sale; in a power-of-sale foreclosure, no court \napproval is required. In most states, the mortgagor whose property was foreclosed is given some period of \ntime—six months or a year—to redeem the property; otherwise, the sale is done, but the debtor may be liable \nfor the deficiency, if any. The deed of trust avoids any judicial involvement by having the borrower convey the \nland to a disinterested trustee for the benefit of the lender; the trustee sells it upon default, with the \nproceeds (after expenses) going to the lender. Another method of real property security is a land contract: \ntitle shifts to the buyer only at the end of the term of payments. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1094 \n \n1.

Cherry notified Chase of the error through a customer service \nrepresentative. Cherry, however, received a check dated August 15, 2000, as an escrow refund on the \nmortgage. Chase subsequently recorded a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the Pinellas County public records \non October 19, 2000. On November 14, 2000, Chase sent Cherry a “Loan Reactivation” letter with a new \nloan number upon which to make the payments. During this time, Cherry was placing his mortgage \npayments into a bank account, which subsequently were put into an escrow account maintained by his \nattorney. These payments were not, and have not, been tendered to Chase. As a result of the failure to \ntender, Chase sent Cherry an acceleration warning on November 17, 2000, and again on March 16, 2001. \nChase notified the credit bureaus as to Cherry’s default status and moved for foreclosure. In a letter \naddressed to Cherry’s attorney, dated April 24, 2001, Chase’s attorney advised Cherry to make the \nmortgage payments to Chase. Chase recorded a “vacatur, revocation, and cancellation of satisfaction of \nmortgage” (vacatur) [vacatur: an announcement filed in court that something is cancelled or set aside; an \nannulment] in the Pinellas County public records on May 3, 2001. Chase signed the vacatur on March 21, \n2001, and had it notarized on March 27, 2001. Chase has also been unable to locate the original note, \ndated October 15, 1997, and deems it to be lost.… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1100 \n \nForeclosure \n \nChase accelerated Cherry’s mortgage debt after determining he was in a default status under the mortgage \nprovisions. Chase claims that the right to foreclose under the note and mortgage is “absolute,” [Citation], \nand that this Court should enforce the security interest in the mortgage though Chase made an \nadministrative error in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the public records.… \n \nMortgage \n \n…Chase relies on the Florida Supreme Court decision in United Service Corp. v. Vi-An Const. Corp., \n[Citation] (Fla.1955), which held that a Satisfaction of Mortgage “made through a mistake may be \ncanceled” and a mortgage reestablished as long as no other innocent third parties have “acquired an \ninterest in the property.” Generally the court looks to the rights of any innocent third parties, and if none \nexist, equity will grant relief to a mortgagee who has mistakenly satisfied a mortgage before fully paid. \n[Citation]. Both parties agree that the mortgage was released before the debt was fully paid. Neither party \nhas presented any facts to this Court that implies the possibility nor existence of a third party interest. \nAlthough Cherry argues under Biggs v. Smith, 184 So. 106, 107 (1938), that a recorded satisfaction of \nmortgage is “prima facie evidence of extinguishment of a mortgage lien,” Biggs does not apply this \nstandard to mortgage rights affected by a mistake in the satisfaction. \n \nTherefore, on these facts, this Court acknowledges that a vacatur is a proper remedy for Chase to correct \nits unilateral mistake since “equity will grant relief to those who have through mistake released a \nmortgage.” [Citation.] Accordingly, this Court holds that an equity action is required to make a vacatur \nenforceable unless the parties consent to the vacatur or a similar remedy during the mortgage \nnegotiation.… \n \nTender \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1101 \nCherry has not made a mortgage payment to Chase since August 2000, but claims to have made these \npayments into an escrow account, which he claims were paid to the escrow account because Chase \nrecorded a satisfaction of his mortgage and, therefore, no mortgage existed. Cherry also claims that \nrepresentatives of Chase rejected his initial attempts to make payments because of a lack of a valid loan \nnumber. Chase, however, correctly argues that payments made to an escrow account are not a proper \ntender of payment.Matthews v. Lindsay, [Citation] (1884) (requiring tender to be made to the court). Nor \ndid Cherry make the required mortgage payments to the court as provided by [relevant court rules], \nallowing for a “deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether that party claims all or \nany part of the sum or thing.” Further, Chase also correctly argues that Cherry’s failure to tender the \npayments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court is more than just a “technical breach” \nof the mortgage and note.

Although Cherry, through excusable neglect or a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1103 \nmisunderstanding as to what his rights were after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered, failed to \ntender the payments, Chase is also not without fault; its conduct in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage \ninto the Pinellas County public records directly contributed to Cherry’s failure to tender timely payments. \nCherry’s attempt at making the mortgage payments, coupled with Chase’s improper satisfaction of \nmortgage fits squarely within the limited circumstance created to justify a court’s denial of a foreclosure. \nEquity here requires a balancing between Chase’s right to the security interest encumbered by the \nmortgage and Cherry’s attempts to make timely payments. As such, these limited circumstances exist to \nensure that a foreclosure remains an action in equity.

The 2005 act—preceded by “massive lobbying largely by banks and credit card companies” [1]—\nwas intended by its promoters to restore personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system. \nThe law’s critics said it was simply a way for the credit card industry to extract more money from \nconsumers before their debts were wiped away. \n \nFigure 27.1 US Bankruptcies, 1980–2009 \n \nBankruptcy Action.com,http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/USbankstats.htm, statistics from \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. \n \nBankruptcy Courts, Judges, and Costs \nEach federal judicial district has a US Bankruptcy Court, whose judges are appointed by US Courts of \nAppeal. Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases. Chapter 5, “Creditors, the \nDebtor, and the Estate,” deals with the debtor’s “estate”—his or her assets. It lays down ground rules for",

            "chunk": "The bankruptcy act exempts certain property of the estate of an individual debtor so that he or she will not \nbe impoverished upon discharge. Exactly what is exempt depends on state law. \n \nNotwithstanding the Constitution’s mandate that Congress establish “uniform laws on the subject of \nbankruptcies,” bankruptcy law is in fact not uniform because the states persuaded Congress to allow \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1135 \nnonuniform exemptions. The concept makes sense: what is necessary for a debtor in Maine to live a \nnonimpoverished postbankruptcy life might not be the same as what is necessary in southern California. \nThe bankruptcy code describes how a person’s residence is determined for claiming state exemptions: \nbasically, where the debtor lived for 730 days immediately before filing or where she lived for 180 days \nimmediately preceding the 730-day period. For example, if the debtor resided in the same state, without \ninterruption, in the two years leading up to the bankruptcy, he can use that state’s exemptions. If not, the \nlocation where he resided for a majority of the half-year preceding the initial two years will be used. The \npoint here is to reduce “exemption shopping”—to reduce the incidences in which a person moves to a \ngenerous exemption state only to declare bankruptcy there. \n \nUnless the state has opted out of the federal exemptions (a majority have), a debtor can choose which \nexemptions to claim. [2] There are also some exemptions not included in the bankruptcy code: veteran’s, \nSocial Security, unemployment, and disability benefits are outside the code, and alimony payments are \nalso exempt under federal law. The federal exemptions can be doubled by a married couple filing together. \n \nHere are the federal exemptions: [3] \n \nHomestead: \n• \nReal property, including mobile homes and co-ops, or burial plots up to $20,200. Unused \nportion of homestead, up to $10,125, may be used for other property. \n \nPersonal Property: \n• \nMotor vehicle up to $3,225. \n• \nAnimals, crops, clothing, appliances and furnishings, books, household goods, and musical \ninstruments up to $525 per item, and up to $10,775 total. \n• \nJewelry up to $1,350. \n• \n$1,075 of any property, and unused portion of homestead up to $10,125. \n• \nHealth aids. \n• \nWrongful death recovery for person you depended upon. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1136 \n• \nPersonal injury recovery up to $20,200 except for pain and suffering or for pecuniary loss. \n• \nLost earnings payments. \n \nPensions: \n• \nTax exempt retirement accounts; IRAs and Roth IRAs up to $1,095,000 per person. \n \nPublic Benefits: \n• \nPublic assistance, Social Security, Veteran’s benefits, Unemployment Compensation. \n• \nCrime victim’s compensation. \n \nTools of Trade: \n• \nImplements, books, and tools of trade, up to $2,025. \n \nAlimony and Child Support: \n• \nAlimony and child support needed for support. \n \nInsurance: \n• \nUnmatured life insurance policy except credit insurance. \n• \nLife insurance policy with loan value up to $10,775. \n• \nDisability, unemployment, or illness benefits. \n• \nLife insurance payments for a person you depended on, which you need for support. \n \nIn the run-up to the 2005 changes in the bankruptcy law, there was concern that some states—especially \nFlorida [4]—had gone too far in giving debtors’ exemptions. The BAPCPA amended Section 522 to limit the \namount of equity a debtor can exempt, even in a state with unlimited homestead exemptions, in certain \ncircumstances. (Section 522(o) and (p) set out the law’s changes.) \n \nSecured Property \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1137 \nAs already noted, secured creditors generally have priority, even above the priority claims. That’s why \nbanks and lending institutions almost always secure the debtor’s obligations. But despite the general rule, \nthe debtor can avoid certain types of security interests. Liens that attach to assets that the debtor is \nentitled to claim as exempt can be avoided to the extent the lien impairs the value of the exemption in \nboth Chapter 13 and Chapter 7. To be avoidable, the lien must be a judicial lien (like a judgment or a \ngarnishment), or a nonpossessory, non-purchase-money security interest in household goods or tools of \nthe trade. \n \nTax liens (which are statutory liens, not judicial liens) aren’t avoidable in Chapter 7 even if they impair \nexemptions; tax liens can be avoided in Chapter 13 to the extent the lien is greater than the asset’s value. \n \nDischargeable and Nondischargeable Debts \nThe whole point of bankruptcy, of course, is for debtors to get relief from the press of debt that they \ncannot reasonably pay. \n \nDischargeable Debts \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable to pay any remaining unpaid debts (except \nnondischargeable debts) that arose before the court issued the order of relief.

The most common nondischargeable debts listed in \nSection 523 include the following: \n \n• \nAll debts not listed in the bankruptcy petition \n• \nStudent loans—unless it would be an undue hardship to repay them (seeSection 27.6 \"Cases\", In \nre Zygarewicz) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1138 \n• \nTaxes—federal, state, and municipal \n• \nFines for violating the law, including criminal fines and traffic tickets \n• \nAlimony and child support, divorce, and other property settlements \n• \nDebts for personal injury caused by driving, boating, or operating an aircraft while intoxicated \n• \nConsumer debts owed to a single creditor and aggregating more than $550 for luxury goods or \nservices incurred within ninety days before the order of relief \n• \nCash advances aggregating more than $825 obtained by an individual debtor within ninety days \nbefore the order for relief \n• \nDebts incurred because of fraud or securities law violations \n• \nDebts for willful injury to another’s person or his or her property \n• \nDebts from embezzlement \n \nThis is not an exhaustive list, and as noted in Section 27.3 \"Chapter 7 Liquidation\", there are some \ncircumstances in which it is not just certain debts that aren’t dischargeable: sometimes a discharge is \ndenied entirely. \n \nReaffirmation \nA debtor may reaffirm a debt that was discharged. Section 524 of the bankruptcy code provides important \nprotection to the debtor intent on doing so. No reaffirmation is binding unless the reaffirmation was \nmade prior to the granting of the discharge; the reaffirmation agreement must contain a clear and \nconspicuous statement that advises the debtor that the agreement is not required by bankruptcy or \nnonbankruptcy law and that the agreement may be rescinded by giving notice of rescission to the holder \nof such claim at any time prior to discharge or within sixty days after the agreement is filed with the court, \nwhichever is later. \n \nA written agreement to reaffirm a debt must be filed with the bankruptcy court. The attorney for the \ndebtor must file an affidavit certifying that the agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary \nagreement, that the agreement does not impose an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent of the \ndebtor, and that the attorney has fully advised the debtor of the legal consequences of the agreement and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1139 \nof a default under the agreement. Where the debtor is an individual who was not represented by an \nattorney during the course of negotiating the agreement, the reaffirmation agreement must be approved \nby the court, after disclosures to the debtor, and after the court finds that it is in the best interest of the \ndebtor and does not cause an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent. \n \nProperty Included in the Estate \nWhen a bankruptcy petition is filed, a debtor’s estate is created consisting of all the debtor’s then-\nexisting property interests, whether legal or equitable. In addition, the estate includes any bequests, \ninheritances, and certain other distributions of property that the debtor receives within the next 180 days. \nIt also includes property recovered by the trustee under certain powers granted by the law. What is not \nexempt property will be distributed to the creditors. \n \nThe bankruptcy code confers on the trustee certain powers to recover property for the estate that the \ndebtor transferred before bankruptcy. \n \nOne such power (in Section 544) is to act as a hypothetical lien creditor. This power is best explained \nby an example. Suppose Dennis Debtor purchases equipment on credit from Acme Supply Company. \nAcme fails to perfect its security interest, and a few weeks later Debtor files a bankruptcy petition. By \nvirtue of the section conferring on the trustee the status of a hypothetical lien creditor, the trustee can act \nas though she had a lien on the equipment, with priority over Acme’s unperfected security interest. Thus \nthe trustee can avoid Acme’s security interest, with the result that Acme would be treated as an unsecured \ncreditor. \n \nAnother power is to avoid transactions known as voidable preferences—transactions highly favorable",

            "chunk": "however, have concluded that undue hardship [and] is something more than “garden-variety hardship.” \n[Citation.] Only cases involving “real and substantial” hardship merit discharges. See [Citation.] \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has adopted a three-part test to guide courts in their attempts to determine whether a \ndebtor will suffer an undue hardship is required to repay a student loan: \n \n• \nFirst, the debtor must establish “that she cannot maintain, based on current income and \nexpenses, a ‘minimal’ standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the \nloans.”… \n• \nSecond, the debtor must show “that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of \naffairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.”… \n• \nThe third prong requires “that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.…” \n \n(Pena, citing Brunner v. N.Y. State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., [Citation]). \n \nDebtor must satisfy all three parts of the Brunner test before her student loans can be discharged. Failure \nto prove any of the three prongs will defeat a debtor’s case. \n \nWhen this bankruptcy case was filed in September 2005, the debtor was a single woman and had no \ndependents. She is 39 years old. \n \nSchedule I reported that the debtor was unemployed. The debtor’s responses to the Statement of Financial \nAffairs revealed that she had received $5,500 in income during 2005 prior to the filing of the petition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1160 \nEvidence at trial indicated that after the petition was filed, the debtor found work and earned a total of \n$9,424 in 2005. In 2004 and 2003, she earned $13,994 and $17,339, respectively. \nDespite this modest income, the debtor did not immediately file an adversary proceeding to determine the \ndischargeability of her student loans. It was almost three years after the entry of her chapter 7 discharge \n‘on January 3, 2006 that the debtor reopened her chapter 7 case in order to pursue this adversary \nproceeding.’ \n \nIn her complaint, the debtor admits that after she received a discharge, she found part-time work with a \nchurch and later took a full-time job as a speech therapist. During 2006, the debtor earned $20,009 and \nin 2007 she earned $37,314. Hence, while it is clear the debtor’s income was very modest in the time \nperiod immediately prior to her bankruptcy petition, her financial situation improved during her \nbankruptcy case. \n \nThe court cannot conclude based on the evidence of the debtor’s financial circumstances up to the date of \nthe discharge, that she was unable to maintain a minimal standard of living if she was required to repay \nher students [sic] loans. \n \nHowever, in January 2007, the debtor was injured in an automobile accident. Her injuries eventually \nhalted the financial progress she had been making and eventually prevented her from working. She now \nsubsists on social security disability payments. \n \nThe circumstance creating the debtor’s hardship, the automobile accident, occurred after her chapter 7 \npetition was filed, indeed, approximately one year after her discharge was entered. The debtor is \nmaintaining that this post-petition, post-discharge circumstance warrants a declaration that her student \nloans were discharged effective from the petition date. \n \nWhen must the circumstances creating a debtor’s hardship arise: before the bankruptcy case is filed; after \nthe case if filed but prior to the entry of a discharge; or at anytime, including after the entry of a \ndischarge? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1161 \n \nThe court concludes that the circumstances causing a chapter 7 debtor’s financial hardship must arise \nprior to the entry of the discharge. If the circumstances causing a debtor’s hardship arise after the entry of \na discharge, those circumstances cannot form the basis of a determination that repayment of a student \nloan will be an undue hardship.… \n \n[T]here is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code requiring that a complaint under section 523(a)(8) [to \ndischarge student loans] be filed at any particular point in a bankruptcy case, whether it is filed under \nchapter 7 or 13. [Relevant Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure] permits such dischargeability \ncomplaints to be brought at any time, including after the entry of a discharge and the closing of the \nbankruptcy case.… \n \nWhile a debtor’s decision to file an action to determine the dischargeability of a student loan is not \ntemporally constrained, this does not mean that a debtor’s financial hardship may arise after a discharge \nhas been entered. \n \n[The] Coleman [case, cited by debtor] deals with the ripeness of a dispute concerning the dischargeability \nof a student loan. [The Ninth Circuit held that it] is ripe for adjudication at any point during the case. The \nNinth Circuit did not conclude, however, that a debtor could rely upon post-discharge circumstances to \nestablish undue hardship. In fact, the court in Coleman made clear that the debtor could take a snapshot",

Most bankruptcies are no-asset, \nso creditors get nothing. \n \nUnder Chapter 7’s 2005 amendments, debtors must pass a means test to be eligible for relief; if they make \ntoo much money, they must file Chapter 13. \n \nCertain property is exempt from the estate of an individual debtor. States may opt out of the federal list of \nexemptions and substitute their own; most have. \n \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable for most debts. However, some debts are not \ndischargeable, and bad faith by the debtor may preclude discharge. Under some circumstances, a debtor \nmay reaffirm a discharged debt. A Chapter 7 case may be converted to Chapter 11 or 13 voluntarily, or to \nChapter 11 involuntarily. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1172 \nChapter 11 provides for reorganization. Any person eligible for discharge in Chapter 7 is eligible for \nChapter 11, except stockbrokers and commodity brokers; those who have too much debt to file Chapter 13 \nand surpass the means test for Chapter 7 file Chapter 11. Under Chapter 11, the debtor retains possession \nof the business and may continue to operate it with its own management unless the court appoints a \ntrustee. The court may do so either for cause or if it is in the best interests of the creditors. The court must \nappoint a committee of unsecured creditors, who remain active throughout the proceeding. The debtor \nmay file its own reorganization plan and has the exclusive right to do so within 120 days if it remains in \npossession. The plan must be accepted by certain proportions of each impaired class of claims and \ninterests. It is binding on all creditors, and the debtor is discharged from all debts once the court confirms \nthe plan. \n \nChapter 13 is for any individual with regular income who has difficulty paying debts; it is voluntary only; \nthe debtor must get credit counseling. The debtor presents a payment plan to creditors, and the court \nappoints a trustee. The plan extends the time to pay and may reduce the size of the debt. If the creditors \nwind up with more in this proceeding than they would have in Chapter 7, the court is likely to approve the \nplan. The court may approve a stretch-out of five years. Some debts not dischargeable under Chapter 7 \nmay be under Chapter 13. \n \nAlternatives to bankruptcy are (1) composition (agreement by creditors to accept less than the face \namount of the debt), (2) assignment for benefit of creditors (transfer of debtor’s property to a trustee, who \nuses it to pay debts), and (3) receivership (a disinterested person is appointed by the court to preserve \nassets and distribute them at the court’s direction). Because these are voluntary procedures, they are \nineffective if all parties do not agree to them. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nDavid has debts of $18,000 and few assets.

How much of this property is available \nfor distribution to his creditors in a bankruptcy? Explain. \n4 \nIf David owes his ex-wife alimony (maintenance) payments and is obligated to pay $12,000 for an \neducational loan, what effect will his discharge have on these obligations? \n5 \nAssume that David owns a corporation that he wants to liquidate under Chapter 7.

Mr. Simpson sold his California \nhouse, moved to Florida, and, from occasional appearances in the press, seemed to be living a high-style \nlife with a big house, nice cars, and sharp clothing.

The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged.

The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

Let’s take a closer\nlook at some of the reasons why we study finance.\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may\npique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify\nyou for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in\nCareers in Finance.\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\nanalytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you.

Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty.

A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\n12\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even\nnationalization of a firm or industry.\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n13\n1.2\nThe Role of Finance in an Organization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the finance function.\n•\nExplain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.\nThe Finance Function\nFinance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job\nresponsibilities.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation.

Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.\nMotivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton\nShould you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a\nnew product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular",

This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6\nMicroeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n•\nDiscuss the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n•\nExplain the importance of macroeconomic variables in finance markets.\nMicroeconomics\nIn the business setting, finance is the intersection of economics and accounting. Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\n7\nUnited States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\n23\nHowever, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual\nfirm and industry forecasts. Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse.

Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement.

Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S",

S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\nRole of Management\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have\ndifferent functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is",

Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.\nOften, Congress enacts laws and regulations in response to major economic or other highly visible events.\nFollowing the great market crash of 1929, the US government created a new set of rules and regulations\ngoverning the issuing and trading of securities, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934. The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\nand regulations.\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors.

The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\n•\nconfirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\n•\nverifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\n•\nensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\nverifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\n•\ncoordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States.

Madoff’s fraud\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion.

Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\nhad been newly invested.\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\n(Sources: Diana B.

When perpetuated, these differences may\neventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative\nthat they address the underlying problems of these differences. This will help ensure that normal business\noperations are not being adversely impacted by the agency problem.\nWhile there is no surefire way to resolve all conflicts of interest and agency problems, some measures that can\n52\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nhelp mitigate such issues include the following:\n•\nOffering incentives to management for strong performance and ethical behavior\n•\nAwarding decision makers with stock packages, commissions, and other long-term compensation\npackages to encourage long-term thinking and matching of company objectives with shareholders’\npriorities\n•\nPenalizing poor performance, shortsightedness, and unethical behavior\nThe prevailing belief in agency theory is that when a business creates organizational incentives that encourage\nhard work on projects that will benefit the company in both the short and long term, more employees will be\nencouraged to act in the business’s best interest.\nAnother means of resolving agency problems is through a hostile takeover of the organization. Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest.

While it\nis recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also\nrecognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.\nImpact of ESG Ratings\nIn recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being\nevaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These ratings and\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal\nimportance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per Figure 2.3 below. It is critical for the senior management\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\nwhen necessary.\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\ncompany. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to\n2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards\n53\nrepresent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term\nvalue of company stock.\nThus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a\npoor rating can have a negative impact on a firm’s share price and result in substantial problems. In any case,\nit is important to note that ESG is only a starting point from which it is possible to gather indicators on a\nbusiness and its direction. In the end, it does not present the entire story of a firm. Any investment decisions\nabout the company in question should include a significant amount of additional data.\n2.5\nInteracting with Investors, Intermediaries, and Other Market Participants\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine the investor relations function.\n•\nDiscuss how the investor relations office interacts with investors, regulators, and other corporate\nstakeholders.\n•\nDescribe the topics most often discussed during a quarterly conference call.\n•\nExplain how press release information impacts company stock prices.\nInvestor Relations\nWithin the general field of corporate public relations is a specific subdivision referred to as investor relations\n(IR). IR involves elements of communication, marketing, and finance and is designed to control the flow of\ninformation from the management of a public corporation to its investors and stakeholders.\nBecause the investment community plays such a critical role in the overall growth and success of any\ncorporation, it is imperative that firms maintain strong and open relationships with their shareholder or\npotential investor audience. IR was developed to take responsibility for achieving and maintaining these\ncrucial relationships.\nInvestor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm’s IR group must work very\nclosely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team,\nsuch as the CEO and CFO.\nAs might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely\ndue to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and the International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS).

This legislation resulted in requirements that dramatically increased the extent of financial reporting for\nany publicly traded company. SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial\nscandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier.\nIn summary, investor relations functions have responsibilities including, but not limited to,\n•\ncoordinating live shareholder meetings and press conferences;\n•\ndisseminating financial information to the investment community;\n•\nconducting briefings to the financial analyst community;\n•\npublishing the quarterly report and annual report; and\n•\naddressing any issues that arise as a result of financial disclosure.\nThe best time to form an internal IR function or to engage an IR firm is when a company begins the process of\nbecoming publicly traded through an initial public offering, or IPO.\nQuarterly Earnings Conference Calls\nAs a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all publicly traded companies are required to file certain\n54\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfinancial reports with the SEC. The underlying purpose of these requirements is to provide shareholders and\nthe investment community with important operational and financial information on a regular basis and in a\ntransparent manner. Reports filed with the SEC include the annual Form 10-K, quarterly Form 10-Qs, and\ncurrent periodic Form 8-Ks, in addition to proxy reports and certain shareholder and affiliate reporting\ndocuments. Quarterly 10-Qs are an ongoing and regular reporting requirement of publicly traded companies\nand are to be filed within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.\nDepending on a company’s size and the complexity of its operation, a firm is likely to issue an earnings press\nrelease and conduct a conference call with the investment community within this same 45-day period. There\nis no legal requirement for companies to do either of these things, but experts in IR view these\ncommunications tools as best practice. They can add context and commentary to the reported financial\nresults.\nIt is important for companies to do their planning and not enter a quarterly earnings conference call\nunprepared. There is a multitude of available resources for companies to analyze and review in preparation.\nAmong such resources are industry reports prepared by government agencies; the financial reports and\nearnings calls of competing organizations, both within and outside of a company’s primary industry; and\nfinancial research reports prepared by various covering analysts, who follow the specific company and are\nemployed by financial brokerage firms.\nInvestment Meetings and Conferences\nOrganizing the annual meeting of shareholders, investor roadshows, and investment conferences is no easy\ntask for any corporation, though all of these audience-facing events are critical to maintaining strong relations\nwith shareholders and the investment community. It is important to reach shareholders and investors on an\nalmost personal basis by crafting a successful and interesting investment story. For effective investor relations,\nkey messages supporting any ownership or potential investment case should be clear and consistent. These\nkey messages should be embedded within the company’s materials and should form the basis of\npresentations, the corporate website, and annual reports. They should also be reinforced via concrete\nexamples during annual meetings, roadshows, and investor presentations.\nFigure 2.4 Quarterly Investor Relations Presentation (credit: “MAPFRE” by Castilla y León Económica/flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nCorporations have found that using senior management’s time efficiently is also important to investor\nrelations.

Additionally, it is important for a\ncompany’s senior management to end any meeting with feedback from the investor audience and set\ntimelines for follow-up.

Thus, it is\nimportant for IR officers to understand the importance of follow-up communication with their audience.\nPurposes of Corporate Press Releases\nPress releases have always been a vital tool in the communications toolkit of an IR professional. Various social\nmedia channels are also becoming increasingly popular for delivering company information and news.\nHowever, the press release remains a standard medium for most companies to communicate corporate news,\nresults, and ideas.\nPress releases can be written with various intentions. Whether to release financial information, unveil new\nproducts or services, announce changes in management, or a host of other reasons, all communications have\na different objective. Not all press releases are created equally, and they have varying degrees of effectiveness.\nAny press release should contain information in easy-to-understand language that is free of corporate jargon\nand as concise as possible. Press releases may be viewed by multiple audiences, such as customers,\nstakeholders, investors, potential investors, and the general public, which is vital to consider when drafting a\npress release.\nAccording to PR Newswire statistics, press releases that contain multimedia content have been known to\nsubstantially increase press release views.5 Using infographics and charts where possible and relaying the key\nmessages in short, easy-to-digest points make a press release easier for the reader to take in.

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls. Whenever there is inflation, a $100 bill will not\npurchase as much as it did before.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCPI Inflation Calculator\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, $100 in January 1913 had the same purchasing power as\n$1,722.45 in January 2000 and $2,699.20 in January 2021. If you would like to compare the purchasing power\nof a dollar amount in two different time periods, you can use the CPI Inflation Calculator\n(https://openstax.org/r/cpi-inflation-calculator). You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n77\ndelivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows\neconomists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a\ntypical family’s purchases.\nIn an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods\npurchased and the purchasing habits of families, Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon founded the Billion\nPrices Project. Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world. The Billion Prices Project website\n(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project) provides measures for inflation using this data as well as\nresearch papers regarding macroeconomic research.\nHistorical Trends in the Inflation Rate\nInflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed in Figure 3.10. The graph shows that for the past\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.\nFigure 3.10 Rate of Inflation Measured by the Consumer Price Index, 1947–20202\nThe Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a measure of the average monthly\nchange in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers between any two time periods. It can also\nrepresent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88% of the total\npopulation, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed workers, short-\nterm workers, unemployed workers, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\nThe CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation fares, service fees (e.g., water and\nsewer service), and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and\napproximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are\naveraged with weights representing their importance in the spending of a particular group. The index\nmeasures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the\noriginal unadjusted index distributed, the BLS also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series\nreflects all factors that may influence a change in prices. However, it can be very useful to look at the\n78\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nseasonally adjusted CPI, which removes the effects of seasonal changes such as weather, the school year,\nproduction cycles, and holidays.\nThe CPI can be used to recognize periods of inflation and deflation. Significant increases in the CPI within a\nshort time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant decreases in CPI within a short time frame\nmight indicate a period of deflation. However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might\nnot be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods.

The investment\nspending category is roughly 15% to 18% of the US GDP.\nGovernment spending includes spending by federal, state, and local governments. Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported\nfrom other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because\nwe already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must\nsubtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation. Net exports equals exports from the United States minus\nimports from other countries. Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.\nHistorical Trends in GDP\nUS GDP over the past 70 years is represented by the blue line in Figure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced. The red line in Figure 3.12 represents the real GDP. Although its\ngrowth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70\nyears.\n5\n“GDP (Current US$): United States.” The World Bank. 2020. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n81\nFigure 3.12 Growth of the US GDP6 Gross domestic product (GDP), the featured measure of US output, is the market value of the\ngoods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States.

The economy is said to be \"heating up.\" As the expansion continues, inflation often becomes a concern. Fast-paced economic expansion is not sustainable. Eventually, growth slows and unemployment rises. The economy has moved from expansion to contraction when this occurs. The point at which the business cycle turns from expansion to contraction is known as the peak. The point at which the contraction ends and the economy begins to expand again is known as the trough. The length of one business cycle is measured by the time from one trough to the trough of the next cycle."

Historically, a recession was defined as two consecutive quarters of declining\nGDP. Today, the NBER defines a recession in a broader, less precise manner; it will declare a recession when\nthere is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts for at least a few\nmonths.8 Measures of real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale and retail sales are\nconsidered in addition to real GDP.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research was founded in 1920 to create measures of economic activity\nthat could be used in public policy discussions. It is a private, nonpartisan organization that conducts\nresearch that is followed by businesses and the public sector. You can find out more about the NBER and\nview many of its research papers by visiting its website (https://openstax.org/r/nber-website).\nHistorical Trends\nThe NBER has identified business cycle peaks and troughs in data going back to the mid-19th century. Figure\n3.16 lists each of these cycles, denoting the months of peaks and troughs. We see a repetition of the economic\nbehavior—an expansion, a peak, a recession, and a trough, followed by yet another expansion, peak,\nrecession, and trough. The cycles are events that repeatedly occur in the same order.\n8\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. “Business Cycle Dating Committee Announcements.” July 19, 2021. https://www.nber.org/\nresearch/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcements\n84\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 3.16 Peak and Trough Months of Historical Business Cycles (source: National Bureau of Economic Research)\nHowever, the cycles are not identical; the lengths of the cycles vary greatly. On average, the contractions have\nlasted about 17 months and expansions have lasted about 41 months. The typical business cycle has been\nabout 4.5 years long.\nAt the time of this writing, the United States is in an economic recession.9 The previous trough was in June\n2009. From the summer of 2009 through February 2020, the US economy was in the expansionary phase of the\nbusiness cycle. This expansion peaked in February 2020, when the economy fell into a contractionary period\nassociated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This 128-month expansion is the longest expansion in US history.\nOnly two other expansions have lasted for over 100 months: the 120-month expansion that ran through the\n1990s and the 106-month expansion that ran during the 1960s. The longest recessionary period on record is\nthe 65-month recession that occurred during the 1870s. The recession that began in 1929 was the second-\nlongest recession in US history. At 43 months long, this recession that ended in 1933 was so severe that it has\nbeen called the Great Depression.10\n9\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. “Business Cycle Dating Committee Announcements.” July 19, 2021. https://www.nber.org/\nresearch/business-cycle-dating/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcements\n3.3 • Business Cycles and Economic Activity\n85\n3.4\nInterest Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the relationship between the nominal interest rate and inflation.\n•\nCalculate the real rate of interest.\n•\nExplain the relationship between interest rates and risk.\nMarket for Loanable Funds\nAn interest rate is the rental price of money. The concepts of supply, demand, and equilibrium apply in this\nmarket just as they do in other markets. This market is referred to as the market for loanable funds.\nIn the market for loanable funds, the suppliers of funds are economic entities that currently have a surplus in\ntheir budget. In other words, they have more income than they currently want to spend; they would like to\nsave some of their money and spend it in future time periods. Instead of just putting these savings in a box on\na shelf for safekeeping until they want to spend it, they can let someone else borrow that money. In essence,\nthey are renting that money to someone else, who pays a rental price called the interest rate.\nThe suppliers of loanable funds, also known as lenders, are represented by the upward-sloping curve in Figure\n3.17. A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as",

If you want to borrow money to purchase a\ncar and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.\nOr suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.",

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\nhave depreciated.\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. Over 765,000 time series of data are available. In addition to being viewable in\ngraphical and text form on the FRED site, the data is easily downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.\nKey Terms\nbusiness cycle\na period of economic expansion followed by economic contraction\nceteris paribus\nholding all other things constant\nconsumer price index (CPI)\na measure of inflation based on the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family of four might purchase\ncore inflation index\na measure of inflation that removes food and energy prices from the CPI\ndemand\nthe quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase during a given\ntime period, ceteris paribus\neconomic exposure\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s sales and number of\ncustomers\nequilibrium\nthe point at which the demand and supply curves for a good or service intersect\nequilibrium price\nthe price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\nexpansion\nthe part of the business cycle in which GDP is growing\n3 • Summary\n95\nGDP deflator\na measure of inflation tracked by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, intended to measure what\nGDP would be if prices did not change from one year to the next",

Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\n102\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexpense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\nWho Uses Each Method?\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is\nreceived). Cash can often be received a significant amount of time after the initial transaction. Considering this\namount allows accountants to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and complete information to stakeholders.\nThere are several reasons accrual-basis accounting is preferred to cash-basis accounting. Accrual-basis\naccounting is required by GAAP because it typically provides a better sense of the financial well-being of a\ncompany. Accrual-based accounting information allows management to analyze a company’s progress, and\nmanagement can use that information to improve their business. Accrual accounting is also used to assist\ncompanies in securing financing because banks will typically require a company to provide accrual-basis\nfinancial income statements. The Internal Revenue Service requires businesses to report using accrual-basis\ninformation when preparing tax returns. In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based\naccounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.\nSo why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-\nbasis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from\nsuch requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?",

In our current example, Chris’s landscaping business, the “revenue,” or the value of services\n4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\n107\nperformed, for the month of August would be $1,400. It is the value Chris received in exchange for the services\nprovided to her clients. Likewise, when a business provides goods or services to customers for cash at the time\nof the service or in the future, the business classifies the amount(s) as revenue. Just as the $1,400 revenues\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as\nearning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or\npayments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar\nvalue of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCoffee Shop Products\nThink about a coffee shop in your area. Identify items the coffee shop sells that would be classified as\nrevenues. Remember, revenues for the coffee shop are related to its primary purpose: selling coffee and\nrelated items. Or, better yet, make a trip to the local coffee shop and get a first-hand experience.\nSolution:\nMany coffee shops earn revenue through multiple revenue streams, including coffee and other specialty\ndrinks, food items, gift cards, and merchandise.\nShort-Term Revenue Recognition Examples\nTwo brief examples may help illustrate the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting.\nAssume that a business sells $200 worth of merchandise. In some businesses, there are two ways the\ncustomers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards\nand are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer\nto take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.\nA cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of\naccounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the\nsame time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nA credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash\nbasis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,\nunder terms stipulated by the seller. For example, assume that in the next year of Chris’s landscaping\nbusiness, on April 1, she provides $500 worth of services to one of her customers. The sale is made on account,\nwith the payment due 45 days later. Under the cash basis of accounting, the revenue would not be recorded\nuntil May 16, when the cash was received. Under the accrual basis of accounting, this sale would be recorded\nin the financial statements at the time the services were provided, April 1. The reason the sale would be\nrecorded is that, under accrual accounting, the business reports that it provided $500 worth of services to its\ncustomer. The fact that the customers will pay later is viewed as a separate transaction under accrual\naccounting (see Figure 4.6).\nFigure 4.6 Credit versus Cash On the left is a credit sale recorded under the cash basis of accounting.

Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\nestimated useful life.\nRecording the Initial Asset\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years.

It is common and\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\nand increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined\nby the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and\noverstate net income by $1.7 billion.4\nComponents Used in Calculating Depreciation\nThe expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful\nlife is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we\nwould allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\n$10,000.",

It represents the\namount of expense being recognized in the current period. Accumulated depreciation, on the other hand,\nrepresents the sum of all depreciation expense recognized to date, or the total of all prior depreciation\nexpense for the asset. It is a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account and is used to offset\nthe main account balance that records the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life. In this case,\nthe asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated\ndepreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet\nto show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense\nthrough depreciation.\nIt is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated. For example, land is not\ndepreciated because depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over its useful life. How can one\ndetermine a useful life for land? It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\naccounting courses. Note that these methods are for accounting and reporting purposes. The IRS allows firms\nto use the same or different methods to depreciate assets in calculating taxable income.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFixed Assets\nYou work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a\nproduction and warehouse facility in Pennsylvania.

Double\ndeclining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under\nstraight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a\nfive-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year.\nNext, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-\n118\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndeclining method takes usage into account by doubling the straight-line percentage. For a four-year asset,\nmultiply 25 percent\n, or 50 percent. For a five-year asset, multiply 20 percent\n, or 40 percent.\nOne unique feature of the double-declining-balance method is that in the first year, the estimated salvage\nvalue is not subtracted from the total asset cost before calculating the first year’s depreciation expense.\nInstead, the total cost is multiplied by the calculated percentage. However, depreciation expense is not\npermitted to take the book value below the estimated salvage value, as demonstrated in Figure 4.15.\nFigure 4.15 Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation, and Book Value, Years 1–5\nNotice that in year four, the remaining book value of $12,528 was not multiplied by 40 percent. This is because\nthe expense would have been $5,011.20, and since we cannot depreciate the asset below the estimated\nsalvage value of $10,000, the expense cannot exceed $2,528, which is the amount left to depreciate (difference\nbetween the book value of $12,528 and the salvage value of $10,000). Since the asset has been depreciated to\nits salvage value at the end of year four, no depreciation can be taken in year five.\nIn our example, the first year’s double-declining-balance depreciation expense would be\n. For the remaining years, the double-declining percentage is multiplied by the\nremaining book value of the asset. Liam would continue to depreciate the asset until the book value and the\nestimated salvage value are the same (in this case, $10,000). The net effect of the differences in straight-line\ndepreciation versus double-declining-balance depreciation is that under the double-declining-balance method,\nthe allowable depreciation expenses are greater in the earlier years than those allowed for straight-line\ndepreciation. However, over the depreciable life of the asset, the total depreciation expense taken will be the\nsame no matter which method the entity chooses. In the current example, both straight-line and double-\ndeclining-balance depreciation will provide a total depreciation expense of $48,000 over its five-year\ndepreciable life.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nMcDonald’s Corporation\nSee Form 10-K (https://openstax.org/r/2019-annual-report-pdf) that was filed with the SEC to determine\nwhich depreciation method McDonald’s Corporation used for its long-term assets in 2019.\nHint: Use the search feature to search for key words in an annual report to find information more quickly.\nFor example, search “depreciation.” You should find the information you are looking for on page 40 of the\nannual report.\nBased on the company’s business model and the industry in which it operates, why do you think\nMcDonald’s chose this method of depreciating assets?

                    "answer": "Straight line depreciation method is the most common method used in the accounting world. It is also the simplest method of depreciation. Straight line depreciation is the depreciation method in which the same amount of depreciation is charged on an asset in each accounting period of its useful life. It is a constant amount of depreciation in each year. This method is based on the assumption that the asset generates equal benefits throughout its useful life. This method is used for assets that have a finite life. It is also known as fixed installments method. This method is used when the useful life of the asset is known and the benefits are constant."

However, “management teams typically fail to invest either time or attention into\nmaking or periodically revisiting and revising reasonably supportable estimates of asset lives or salvage\nvalues, or the selection of depreciation methods, as prescribed by GAAP.”5 This failure is not an ethical\napproach to properly accounting for the use of assets.\nAccountants need to analyze depreciation of an asset over the entire useful life of the asset. As an asset\nsupports the cash flow of the organization, expensing its cost needs to be allocated, not just recorded as an\narbitrary calculation. An asset’s depreciation may change over its life according to its use. If asset depreciation\nis arbitrarily determined, the recorded “gains or losses on the disposition of depreciable property assets seen\nin financial statements”6 are not true best estimates. Due to operational changes, the depreciation expense\nneeds to be periodically reevaluated and adjusted.\nAny mischaracterization of asset usage is not proper GAAP and is not proper accrual accounting. Therefore,\n“financial statement preparers, as well as their accountants and auditors, should pay more attention to the\nquality of depreciation-related estimates and their possible mischaracterization and losses of credits and\ncharges to operations as disposal gains.”7 An accountant should always follow GAAP guidelines and allocate\nthe expense of an asset according to its usage.\n5\nHoward B.

Under normal circumstances, this might have been considered just\nanother accounting fiasco leading to the end of a company. However, WorldCom controlled a large\npercentage of backbone routes, a major component of the hardware supporting the internet, as even the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission recognized. If such an event were to happen today, it could shut\ndown international commerce and would be considered a national emergency.10 As demonstrated by\nWorldCom, the unethical behavior of a few accountants could have shut down the world’s online\nbusinesses and international commerce.

While\nbusinesses work hard to avoid net loss situations, it is not uncommon for a company to sustain a net loss from\ntime to time. It is difficult, however, for businesses to remain viable while experiencing net losses over the long\nterm.\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function is:\nTo be complete, we must also consider the impact of gains and losses. While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\nProfit versus Cash Flow\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the\nneed for the statement of cash flows. Stakeholders need to know the financial performance (as measured by\nthe income statement—that is, net income or net loss) and financial position (as measured by the balance\nsheet—that is, assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) of the business. This information is provided in the\nincome statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. However, since these financial statements\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing.

The same is true on the expenses side. An expense can be incurred, such as an electric bill, but cash\nmay not have been paid out yet. Thus, an expense is recorded and recognized on the income statement, but\ncash has not yet been given up. The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net\nincome (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.\n4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\n123\nSummary\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\naccounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash\nbasis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.\n4.2 Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\nDouble-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts\nimpacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual-basis accounting\nan accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\nwhen paid\ncapitalize\nthe process in which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet and its allocated costs are\nexpensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life\ncash-basis accounting\na method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash\ncredit\na record of financial information on the right side of an account\ndebit\na record of financial information on the left side of each account\n124\n4 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndepreciation\nthe process of allocating the costs of a tangible asset over the asset’s economic life\ndouble-entry accounting\nan accounting method that requires the sum of the debits to equal the sum of the\ncredits for each transaction\nexpense\na cost associated with providing goods or services\nexpense recognition\n(also, matching principle) matches expenses with associated revenues in the period in\nwhich the revenues were generated\ngains\nincreases in organizational value from activities that are “incidental or peripheral” to the primary\npurpose of the business\nincome statement",

            "chunk": "specific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\nrather than a net loss.\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\nfuture results.\nFirms report their sales and any reductions to sales separately on the income statement. They begin with\ngross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and\n$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is\ncustomary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margin\ngross profit/sales.) Cost of\ngoods sold includes the costs directly involved in making the product that was sold during the period.\nCommon examples of costs included in cost of goods sold include direct labor, direct materials, and the\noverhead assigned to the product in production. For a service business, this would include its direct labor and\nany materials used to deliver its services. For a retail firm like Clear Lake Sporting Goods, this would include\nthe costs of all the goods it purchased for resale. Clear Lake’s COGS is seen at $50,000 and $60,000 for the\nprior and current years. Note that different types of companies will have different types of costs deducted in\ntheir Cost of Goods section. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a retailer, or merchandiser that buys good to resell.\nTheir cost of goods includes the cost of goods they purchased to resell. In the link to learning, you will explore\nApple, a technology manufacturer. Their cost of goods would include the cost to manufacture the goods they\n130\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nsell. Another type of firm is a service firm. A law office, for example, would include primarily the cost of labor in\ntheir cost of services.\nGross profit is a reflection of how profitable the firm’s performance was in its core business function. It\nincludes only the core business and direct costs of performing that business. If the company were a shoe\ncompany, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply making the shoes it sold. If it\nwere a bakery, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply baking the goods it sold.\nGross profit shows financial statement users how effective the business is at generating top-line profits on\ntheir core business function. It does not reflect the performance of other areas of the firm such as other\noperating costs to support the direct production process, indirect costs, and financing.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see its gross profit in Figure 5.2.

After\ngross profit is calculated, other operating expenses are deducted in order to calculate the firm’s income from\noperations, also commonly called operating income. Common operating costs found in this section include\nbuilding rent and utilities, property taxes, wages and salaries, and other overhead costs. In Figure 5.3, we can\nsee Clear Lake’s operating expenses. To sell its hunting and fishing equipment in the current year, Clear Lake\nSporting Goods paid rent for its building ($5,500) and utilities for its retail and warehouse spaces ($2,500);\nrecorded depreciation on equipment, buildings, and store furnishings (shelves, racks, etc.) ($3,600); and paid\nsalaries to its indirect employees in accounting, purchasing, and human resources ($5,400).

This still does not include other\nmiscellaneous items outside the scope of a firm’s normal business.

However, it only generated\nin gross profit and\nof additional operating income. Further investigation shows that while net sales\nincreased, so did the direct costs of its goods (COGS) and its operating expenses.\nWe will further explore how to assess each of these expenses later in the chapter using common-size analysis.\nCommon-size analysis reflects each element of a financial statement as a percentage of the base. In the case\nof the income statement, the base is net sales.

Net income (or loss)\nreflects the net impact of all financial transactions for the firm, including those that are caused by events\noutside the normal course of business. The most common items deducted from operating income to arrive at\nnet income include interest expense, gains/losses, and income tax expense. Remember, gains and losses are\nthose that result from unusual transactions outside the normal course of business. Examples include selling a\npiece of old equipment or a loss on retiring debt.\nWe can see in Figure 5.4 that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has outstanding debt, so it incurred interest expense\n132\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof $2,000 in the current year and $3,000 the prior year.

What is the amount of its total liabilities and equity?\nSolution:\nApple’s total assets for 2020 were $323,888, and its total liabilities and equity were also $323,888. (Amounts\nare in millions.)\nImportance of the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have gone to all the work to carefully assemble a classified balance sheet, what do we use it for?\nThe answer lies within the accounting equation itself. Think of the accounting equation from a “sources and\nclaims” perspective. Under this approach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by\nincurring liabilities or were provided by owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by\ncreditors and/or owners. The balance sheet shows us what the firm has (its assets), who owns them (equity),\nand who the firm owes (its liabilities).\nLimitations of the Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet is indeed a very helpful financial statement, but it also poses challenges. First, assets on the\nbalance sheet, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), are recorded at historical cost.\nHistorical cost is simply the cost paid for the item at the time it was purchased. Changes in market value of big-\nticket items like land or buildings are not reflected in the balance sheet. Land remains at historical cost, and\ndepreciable items like buildings are reflected at their current book value (historical cost less accumulated\ndepreciation). If the asset has appreciated over time, the higher market value of the assets would not be seen\non the balance sheet.\nEstimates are another limitation of the balance sheet. Items on the balance sheet such as allowance for\ndoubtful accounts and allowance for bad debt are based on estimates. The useful lives for calculating\ndepreciation is another common estimate. If these estimates are incorrect, the net value of the asset can be\nunder- or overstated.\nAnother key limitation is the fact that a balance sheet reflects balances at only one given point in time. This\n5.2 • The Balance Sheet\n137\nmeans that the account value could have been quite different on the day before or the day after the date of\nthe balance sheet. For example, if a firm were concerned with certain ratios or investor/lender expectations of\nits cash balance, it could choose to not pay several vendor payments in the last week of December. Thus, on\nDecember 31, the firm reflects a high cash balance on its balance sheet. However, by the end of the first week\nof January, it has caught up on late vendor payments and again shows a low cash balance.\nFinally, there are many possible things of value that are not recorded on the balance sheet. Internally\ngenerated assets and the firm’s human capital are two common examples. Internally generated assets can be\nanything from a website, a process, to an idea.\n5.3\nThe Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify connected elements between the balance sheet and the income statement.\n•\nDifferentiate between expenses and payables.\nNet Income and Retained Earnings\nAs mentioned earlier, the financial statements are linked by certain elements and thus must be prepared in a\ncertain order. The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.",

Each\n142\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfollowing line provides information on any events during the period that changed the value of any of the\naccounts. Common examples of events found on the statement include net income or loss for the period,\nissuing common or preferred stock, purchasing or selling treasury stock, and declaring a dividend.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has just common stock and retained earnings to report in their statement of\nowner’s equity. They had just two events to report in their statement that impacted their equity accounts; they\nreported net income and they issued dividends (see Figure 5.14).\nFigure 5.14 Statement of Stockholder Equity for Clear Lake Sporting Goods\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCash Flows\nKhan Academy (https://openstax.org/l/50CashFlowsVid) explains cash flows in a unique way.\n5.5\nThe Statement of Cash Flows\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nOutline the purpose and importance of the statement of cash flows.\n•\nIdentify the structure and key elements of the statement of cash flows.\nThe final financial statement is the statement of cash flows. It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\nflows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n143\nconsumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect.

FASB (Financial Accounting\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\nfixed assets). Finally, financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business (loans, interest).\nAs mentioned, operating activities are those that are used or generated by the day-to-day operations of the\nfirm. The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these\nare liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an\nincrease to the statement.\nTallying all these adjustments to net income shows Clear Lake’s net cash flows provided by operating activities\nof $53,600 (see Figure 5.16).\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n145\nFigure 5.16 Operating Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\nInvesting Activities\nAs mentioned, investing activities include investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself\n(items like machinery, land, or other fixed assets). These are items that are capitalized (placed on the balance\nsheet and depreciated over time) and thus did not reduce net income. They did, however, cause an impact to\ncash flow (see Figure 5.17).\nDuring the current year, Clear Lake purchased an additional $5,000 in short-term investments (see the\ncomparative balances sheets; the balance in that account increased by $5,000 since the prior year). They also\npurchased additional plant assets in the amount of $13,600. This amount can be figured by comparing the\ndifference in the current and prior plant assets accounts and including the impact of current year depreciation\n($50,000 current year balance less $40,000 prior year balance and $3,600 of depreciation = $13,600 of new\nassets purchased).\nFigure 5.17 Investing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\nFinancing Activities\nRecall that financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business.

This makes it easier to compare figures from one period to the next,\ncompare departments within an organization, and compare the firm to other companies of any size as well as\nindustry averages. On the income statement, analysts can see how much of sales revenue is spent on each\ntype of expense. They can see this breakdown for each firm and compare how different firms function in terms\nof expenses, proportionally. They can also look at the percentage for each expense over time to see if they are\nspending more or less on certain areas of the business, such as research and development. On the balance\nsheet, analysts commonly look to see the percentage of debt and equity to determine capital structure. They\ncan also quickly see the percentage of current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities.\nIn Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement for the current and prior years, we can see that\ncost of goods as a percentage of sales remained the same (see Figure 5.24). This means that while sales\n152\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nincreased, so did cost of goods sold, but it increased at the same proportion as sales. No improvement or\ndecline occurred in the company’s cost of goods sold. The same is true for rent, depreciation, and utilities\nexpenses. One key item did change slightly as a percentage: salaries expense. The 2 percent decrease in\noperating income from the prior year’s 38 percent to the current year’s 36 percent was caused by the increase\nin salaries expense as a percentage of sales.\nNet income, however, only declined by 1 percent from 30 percent in the prior year to 29 percent in the current\nyear because interest expense dropped by 1 percent, offsetting the 2 percent increase in salaries expense.\nFigure 5.24 Common-Size Income Statement\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCommon-Size Income Statement\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Charlie is a much bigger retailer for outdoor gear, as\nCharlie has nearly seven times greater sales than Clear Lake. Common-size statements allow Clear Lake to\ncompare their statements in a meaningful way (see Figure 5.26). Notice that Clear Lake spends 50 percent of\nits sales on cost of goods sold while Charlie spends 59 percent. This is a significant difference that would be an\nindicator that Clear Lake and Charlie have key differences in their operations, purchasing policies, or general\nperformance in their core products.\n154\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nWe know that Charlie is a bigger retailer, and we see this clearly in the rent expense as a percentage of sales.\nCharlie spends 11 percent of its sales on building rent, while Clear Lake spends only 5 percent. A clear\ndifference in performance is hinted at here, alluding to Charlie spending more per square foot on rent or using\nits retail space differently, causing it to rent more space for its product per sales dollar than Clear Lake does.\nDepreciation expense, though not a large figure, is smaller for Charlie, giving us a hint that Charlie has less\ncapital equipment than Clear Lake, perhaps tied to the higher rent expense. It is possible that Charlie rents\nsome of its equipment, which would help explain the higher rent percentage. Finally, Charlie’s salaries\npercentage is significantly higher at 12 percent than Clear Lake’s 5 percent. Though the simple percentage\ndoes not tell us why, it does provide us a hint and allow for further questions or investigation. Charlie may pay\nits employees a much higher wage than Clear Lake. They may also have far more sales associates on the floor\nin their larger spaces than Clear Lake does in their smaller retail spaces.\nNote that although we have compared just two years of data for Charlie and Clear Lake, it is more common to\nuse several years of data to get a more robust view of long-term trends.\nFigure 5.26 Comparison of Common-Size Income Statements\nLINK TO LEARNING\nMicrosoft versus Apple\nLocate the sales, cost of goods sold, and gross profit data for Microsoft (https://openstax.org/r/microsoft-\nfinancial)’s most current period using Yahoo!

Figure 6.2 shows the comparative income statements and\nbalance sheets for the past two years.\nFigure 6.2 Comparative Income Statements and Year-End Balance Sheets Note that the comparative income statements and\n6.2 • Operating Efficiency Ratios\n167\nbalance sheets have been simplified here and do not fully reflect all possible company accounts.\nTo begin an analysis of receivables, it’s important to first understand the cycles and periods used in the\ncalculations.\nOperating Cycle\nA period is one operating cycle of a business. The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the\naccounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make\ninventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of\nfishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other\ncurrent projects. The lower turnover rate may signal a high level of bad debt accounts. The determination of a\nhigh or low turnover rate really depends on the standards of the company’s industry. It’s key to note the\ntradeoff in adjusting credit terms. Loose credit terms may attract more customers but may also increase bad\ndebt expense. Tighter credit terms may attract fewer customers but may also reduce bad debt expense.\nThe formula for accounts receivable turnover is\nNet credit sales are sales made on credit only; cash sales are not included because they do not produce\nreceivables. However, many companies do not report credit sales separately from cash sales, so “net sales”\nmay be substituted for “net credit sales” in this case. Beginning and ending accounts receivable refer to the\n168\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbeginning and ending balances in accounts receivable for the period. The beginning accounts receivable\nbalance is the same figure as the ending accounts receivable balance from the prior period.\nWhen computing the accounts receivable turnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, let’s assume net credit sales\nmake up $100,000 of the $120,000 of the net sales found on the income statement in the current year.\nTo gain a better understanding of its ratio performance, Clear Lake Sporting Goods can compare its turnover\nto industry averages, key competitors, and its own historical ratios. Given this outcome, the managers may\nwant to consider stricter credit lending practices to make sure credit customers are of a higher quality. They\nmay also need to be more aggressive with collecting any outstanding accounts.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nAccounts Receivable Turnover",

Its importance is accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies to report earnings per\nshare on the face of a company’s income statement. This is the only ratio that requires such prominent\nreporting. If fact, public companies are required to report two different earnings per share amounts on their\nincome statements—basic and diluted. We’ve illustrated the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted\nearnings per share, which is not demonstrated here, involves the consideration of all securities, such as stocks\nand bonds, that could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic earnings per share.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFinding Earning per Share for Public Companies\nWhere can you find earnings per share information on public companies?

What are the ethical implications of earnings per share\ncalculations?\nCommon stock shares are normally purchased by investors to generate income through dividends or to sell at\na profit in the future. Investors realize that inadequate earnings per share can result in poor or inconsistent\ndividend payments and fluctuating stock prices. As such, companies seek to produce earnings per share\namounts that rise each period. However, an increase in earnings per share may not always reflect favorable\nperformance, as there are multiple reasons that earnings per share may increase. One way earnings per share\ncan increase is through increased net income. On the other hand, it can also increase when a company buys\nback its own shares of stock.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods generated net income of $30,000 and paid out $3,000 in\n178\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npreferred shareholder dividends last year.

Apple continued to have a healthy financial position with\nample cash supply. It repurchased $18.5 billion of its own stock in the second quarter of 2020.1 The total\nstock buyback over the preceding five years was $282.87 billion, which is 3.5 times higher than any other\ncompany. Since the earnings per share calculation is earnings divided by average outstanding shares, the\nfewer shares there are outstanding, the higher earnings per share goes without the firm having to actually\nraise earnings.\nWhat do you think? Did Apple act ethically in repurchasing large quantities of its own shares? Is it ethical\nfor any company to do so?

The company\nneeds to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,\ncompany revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:\nprofit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.\nProfit Margin\nProfit margin represents how much of sales revenue has translated into income. This ratio shows how much\nof each $1 of sales is returned as profit. The larger the ratio figure (the closer it gets to 1), the more of each\nsales dollar is returned as profit. The portion of the sales dollar not returned as profit goes toward expenses.\nThe formula for profit margin is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the profit margin in the current year is\nThis means that for every dollar of sales, $0.29 returns as profit. If Clear Lake Sporting Goods thinks this is too\nlow, the company would try to find ways to reduce expenses and increase sales.\nReturn on Total Assets\nThe return on total assets measures the company’s ability to use its assets successfully to generate a profit.\nThe higher the return (ratio outcome), the more profit is created from asset use. Average total assets are\nfound by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the balance sheet. The\nbeginning total assets balance in the current year is taken from the ending total assets balance in the prior\nyear. The formula for return on total assets is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the return on total assets for the current year is\nThe higher the figure, the better the company is using its assets to create a profit. Industry standards can\ndictate what an acceptable return is.\n182\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReturn on Assets",

The video provides the formula, a discussion of the concept, and\nthe importance of the ratio.\nReturn on Equity\nReturn on equity measures the company’s ability to use its invested capital to generate income. The invested\ncapital comes from stockholders’ investments in the company’s stock and its retained earnings and is\nleveraged to create profit. The higher the return, the better the company is doing at using its investments to\nyield a profit. The formula for return on equity is\nAverage stockholders’ equity is found by dividing the sum of beginning and ending stockholders’ equity\nbalances found on the balance sheet. The beginning stockholders’ equity balance in the current year is taken\nfrom the ending stockholders’ equity balance in the prior year. Keep in mind that the net income is calculated\nafter preferred dividends have been paid.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we will use the net income figure and deduct the preferred dividends that have\nbeen paid. The return on equity for the current year is\nThe higher the figure, the better the company is using its investments to create a profit. Industry standards\ncan dictate what an acceptable return is.\nThe DuPont Method\nROE in its basic form is useful; however, there are really three components of ROE: operating efficiency (profit\nmargin), asset usage (total asset turnover), and leverage (equity ratio). This is known as the DuPont method.\nIt originated in 1919 when the DuPont company implemented it for internal measurement purposes.2 The\nDuPont method can be expressed using this formula:\nProfit margin indicates how much profit is generated by each dollar of sales and is computed as shown:\nTotal asset turnover indicates the number of sales dollars produced by every dollar invested in capital\nassets—in other words, how efficiently the company is using its capital assets to generate sales. It is computed\nas shown:\n2\nJoshua Kennon. “What Is the DuPont Method Return on Equity, or ROE, Formula?” The Balance.

It is computed as shown:\nUsing DuPont analysis, investors can see overall performance broken down into smaller pieces, which helps\nthem better understand what is driving ROE. We already have the computations for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods’ profit margin and total asset turnover:\nWe can calculate the equity multiplier using the equity multiplier equation and prior calculations for Clear\nLake’s average total assets and average stockholder equity:\nNow that we have all three elements, we can complete the DuPont analysis for Clear Lake Sporting Goods:\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe DuPont Method\nThis video about the DuPont method (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-DuPont-method) walks through\nits history, discusses its basic components, and shows how to calculate and interpret each measurement.\nPerformance Analysis\nROE captures the nuances of all three elements. A good sales margin and a proper asset turnover are both\nneeded for a successful operation. Like all ratios, assessing performance is relative. It’s important to look at\nthe ratio in context of the organization, its history, and the industry.

There are, however, limitations to\nanalysis, so it should be used wisely and in conjunction with other contextual information available.\n6.2 Operating Efficiency Ratios\nEfficiency ratios measure how well management uses the assets of the organization to earn a profit. Common\nefficiency ratios include accounts receivable turnover, total asset turnover, inventory turnover, and days’ sales\nin inventory.\n6.3 Liquidity Ratios\nLiquidity ratios help analysts measure how well an organization can meet its short-term obligations (liabilities)\nas they come due. Common ratios to measure liquidity include the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash\nratio. Each of these three ratios includes more (cash ratio) or less liquid (current ratio) current assets in its\nmeasure of liquidity.\n6.4 Solvency Ratios\nSolvency ratios measure how well an organization can meet its long-term obligations (liabilities) as they come\ndue, or in more general terms, its ability to stay in business. Common solvency ratios include the debt-to-\nassets ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio.\n6.5 Market Value Ratios\nMarket value ratios help analysts assess the value of publicly traded firms in the market. The most commonly\nused market value ratios include earnings per share (EPS), the price/earnings ratio, and book value per share.\n6.6 Profitability Ratios and the DuPont Method\nProfitability ratios help measure how effectively the organization earns a profit.

(credit: modification of \"Time is money\" by Marco Verch/flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nChapter Outline\n7.1 Now versus Later Concepts\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\nWhy It Matters\nOne of the single most important concepts in the study of finance is the time value of money (TVM). This\nconcept puts forward the idea that a dollar received today is worth more than, and therefore preferable to, a\ndollar received at some point in the future. The three primary reasons for this are that (1) money received now\ncan be saved or invested now and earn interest or a return, resulting in more money in the future; (2) any\npromise of future payments of cash will always carry the risk of default; and (3) it is simple human nature for\npeople to prefer making their purchases of goods and services in the present rather than waiting to make\nthem at some future time.\nFor this reason, it is important to incentivize people to give up their present consumption patterns by offering\nthem greater value in the future. Based on the concept of TVM, it can be said that a dollar was worth more to\nus, and thus carried more value, yesterday than it is to us today. It also then follows that a dollar in our\npossession right now carries a greater value for us than a dollar we might receive tomorrow or at some other\npoint in the future.\nThe entire concept of the time value of money is particularly important because it allows savers and investors\nto make better-informed decisions about what to do with their money. TVM can help a person understand\nwhich option may be best based on the critical factors of overall risk, rates of interest, inflation, and return.\nTVM can also be used to help a person understand how much money they’ll need to save in an interest-\nbearing account in order to reach a desired financial goal, such as saving $50,000 in 10 years in an account that\nearns 4% compound interest each year. TVM is the key underlying principle of such important financial\nanalytical activities as retirement planning, corporate capital project evaluation, and even deciding on your\nTime Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\n7\n7 • Why It Matters\n191\nown personal investments and bank accounts.\nIf the main concept behind the TVM is that a specific amount of money in hand now is worth more today than\nthat same amount of money will be worth tomorrow, you might think that a person would be better off\nspending their money now rather than saving it for later use. However, we know that this is not always the\ncase. Sometimes it is simply a better idea to save your money. While inflation can have the effect of making a\ndollar worth less tomorrow than it is worth today, the positive effect of compound interest works in favor of\nsavers and investors.\n7.1\nNow versus Later Concepts\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why time has an impact on the value of money.\n•\nExplain the concepts of future value and present value.\n•\nExplain why lump sum cash flow is the basis for all other cash flows.\nHow and Why the Passage of Time Affects the Value of Money\nThe concept of the time value of money (TVM) is predicated on the fact that it is possible to earn interest\nincome on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or interest-bearing account. As times goes by,\ninterest is earned on amounts you have invested (present value), which effectively means that time will add\nvalue (future value) to your savings. The longer the period of time you have your money invested, the more",

With the advent and wide acceptance and use of\nfinancial calculators and spreadsheet software, FVIF (and other such time value of money tables and factors)\nhave become obsolete, and we will not discuss them in this text. Nevertheless, they are often still published in\nother finance textbooks and are also available on the internet to use if you so choose.\nUsing Timelines to Organize TVM Information\nA useful tool for conceptualizing present value and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual,\n196\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nlinear representation of periods and cash flows over a set amount of time. Each timeline shows today at the\nleft and a desired ending, or future point (maturity date), at the right.\nNow, let us take an example of a future value problem that has a time frame of five years. Before we begin to\nsolve for any answers, it would be a good approach to lay out a timeline like that shown in Table 7.1:\nYear\n0\n(Today)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nTable 7.1\nThe timeline provides a visual reference for us and puts the problem into perspective.\nNow, let’s say that we are interested in knowing what today’s balance of $100 in our saving account, earning\n5% annually, will be worth at the end of each of the next five years. Using the future value formula\nthat we covered earlier, we would arrive at the following values: $105 at the end of year one, $110.25 at the\nend of year two, $115.76 at the end of year three, $121.55 at the end of year four, and $127.63 at the end of\nyear five.\nWith the numerical information, the timeline (at a 5% interest or growth rate) would look like Table 7.2:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n$100.00 $105.00 $110.25 $115.76 $121.55 $127.63\nTable 7.2\nUsing timelines to lay out TVM problems becomes more and more valuable as problems become more\ncomplex. You should get into the habit of using a timeline to set up these problems prior to using the\nequation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet to help minimize input errors. Now we will move on to the different\nmethods available that will help you solve specific TVM problems. These are the financial calculator and the\nExcel spreadsheet.\nUsing a Financial Calculator to Solve TVM Problems\nAn extremely popular method of solving TVM problems is through the use of a financial calculator. Financial\ncalculators such as the Texas Instruments BAII Plus™ Professional (https://openstax.org/r/baii-plus-\nprofessional) will typically have five keys that represent the critical variables used in most common TVM\nproblems: NN, I/Y\nI/Y, PV\nPV, FV\nFV, and PMT\nPMT. These represent the following:\nThese are the only keys on a financial calculator that are necessary to solve TVM problems involving a single\npayment or lump sum.\nExample 1: Future Value of a Single Payment or Lump Sum\nLet’s start with a simple example that will provide you with most of the skills needed to perform TVM functions\ninvolving a single lump sum payment with a financial calculator.\n7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\n197\nSuppose that you have $1,000 and that you deposit this in a savings account earning 3% annually for a period\nof four years. You will naturally be interested in knowing how much money you will have in your account at the\nend of this four-year time period (assuming you make no other deposits and withdraw no cash).\nTo answer this question, you will need to work with factors of $1,000, the present value (PV\nPV); four periods or\nyears, represented by NN; and the 3% interest rate, or I/Y\nI/Y. Make sure that the calculator register information is\ncleared, or you may end up with numbers from previous uses that will interfere with the solution. The register-\nclearing process will depend on what type of calculator you are using, but for the TI BA II Plus™ Professional\ncalculator, clearing can be accomplished by pressing the keys 2ND\n2ND and FV\nFV [CLR TVM].\nOnce you have cleared any old data, you can enter the values in the appropriate key areas: 4 for NN, 3 for I/Y\nI/Y,\nand 1000 for PV\nPV. Now you have entered enough information to calculate the future value. Continue by\npressing the CPT\nCPT (compute) key, followed by the FV\nFV key.

To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower or discount the future value\nback to the current period.\nThe interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the\ndiscount rate because it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to\nthe annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this\ndiscount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing\nthe FV equation, we can turn\ninto\nwhich is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest\nfactor (PVIF). The PVIF is simply the reciprocal of the FVIF, which makes sense because these factors are doing\nexactly opposite things. Therefore, the amount you need to deposit today to earn $20,000 in one year\nat 5% interest is\nThe Multiple-Period Scenario\nThere will often be situations when you need to determine the present value of a cash flow that is scheduled to\noccur several years in the future (see Figure 7.17). We can again use the formula for present value to calculate\na value today of future cash flows over multiple time periods.\n214\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 7.17 Determining Future Cash Flow\nAn example of this would be if you wanted to buy a savings bond for Charlotte, the daughter of a close friend.\nThe face value of the savings bond you have in mind is $1,000, which is the amount Charlotte would receive in\n30 years (the future value). If the government is currently paying 5% per year on savings bonds, how much will\nit cost you today to buy this savings bond?\nThe $1,000 face value of the bond is the future value, and the number of years n that Charlotte must wait to\nget this face value is 30 years. The interest rate r is 5.0% and is the discount rate for the savings bond. Applying\nthe present value equation, we calculate the current price of this savings bond as follows:\nSo, it would cost you $231.38 to purchase this 30-year, 5%, $1,000 face-valued bond.\nWhat we have done in the above example is reduce, or discount, the future value of the bond to arrive at a\nvalue expressed in today’s dollars. Effectively, this discounting process is the exact opposite of compounding\ninterest that we covered earlier in our discussion of future value.\nAn important concept to remember is that compounding is the process that takes a present valuation of\nmoney to some point in the future, while discounting takes a future value of money and equates it to present\ndollar value terms.\nCommon applications in which you might use the present value formula include determining how much\nmoney you would need to invest in an interest-bearing account today in order to finance a college education\nfor your oldest child and how much you would need to invest today to meet your retirement plans 30 years\nfrom now.\nTVM, Inflation, Compounding Interest, Investing, Opportunity Costs, and Risk\nThe time value of money (TVM) is a critical concept in understanding the value of money relative to the\namount of time it is held, saved, or invested. The TVM concept and its specific applications are frequently used\nby individuals and organizations that might wish to better understand the values of financial assets and to\nimprove investing and saving strategies, whether these are personal or within business environments.\nAs we have discussed, the key element behind the concept of TVM is that a given amount of money is worth\nmore today than that same amount of money will be at any point in the future. Again, this is because money\ncan be saved or invested in interest-bearing accounts or investments that will generate interest income over\ntime, thus resulting in increased savings and dollar values as time passes.\nInflation\nThe entire concept of TVM exists largely due to the presence of inflation. Inflation is defined as a general\nincrease in the prices of goods and services and/or a drop in the value of money and its purchasing power.\nThe purchasing power of the consumer dollar is a statistic tracked by the part of the US Bureau of Labor\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n215\nStatistics and is part of the consumer price index (CPI) data that is periodically published by that government\nagency. In a way, purchasing power can be viewed as a mirror image or exact opposite of inflation or increases\nin consumer prices, as measured by the CPI. Figure 7.18 demonstrates the decline in the purchasing power of\nthe consumer dollar over the 13-year period from 2007 to 2020.\nWith this in mind, we can work with the TVM formula and use it to help determine the present value of money\nyou have in hand today, as well as how this same amount of money may be valued at any specific point in the\nfuture and at any specific rate of interest.\nFigure 7.18 Historical Purchasing Power Decline as a Result of Inflation, 2007–2020 (data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\nThe Relationship between TVM and Inflation",

One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it\nis preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when\ninflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending\nmoney later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing\npower of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move\ninto the future.\nMost investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a\npayment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general\nprices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of\nnormal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value\nof financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\nmay be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than\ninflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.\nConversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\nas time goes by under such conditions.\nThe Impact of Inflation on TVM\nThe difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the\neffects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods\nand services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that\nincreasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services\navailable will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services. When more\nmoney is created and made available to the consuming public, the value of each unit of currency will diminish.\n216\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThis will then have the effect of incentivizing consumers to spend their money now, or in the very near future,\ninstead of saving cash for later use. Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to\nincreased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the\ncosts of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\nConsumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it\nnow, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a\ndecision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\ninflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in\ntimes when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing\npower erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\nnow in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through\ninterest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\nLower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed\nas the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on\nto sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money\nless expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and\nservices they may require.

We have also seen that the more quickly inflation rates rise, the more quickly the\ngeneral purchasing power of money will be eroded. Rational investors who set money aside for the future will\ndemand higher interest rates to compensate them for such periods of inflation. However, investors who save\nfor future consumption but leave their money uninvested or underinvested in low-interest-bearing accounts\nwill essentially lose value from their financial assets because each of their future dollars will be worth less,\ncarrying less purchasing power when they end up needing it for use. This relationship of saving and planning\nfor the future is one of the most important reasons to understand the concept of the time value of money.\nNominal versus Real Interest Rates\nOne of the main problems of allowing inflation to determine interest rates is that current interest rates are\nactually nominal interest rates. Nominal rates are “stated,” not adjusted for the effects of inflation. In order to\ndetermine more practical real interest rates, the original nominal rate must be adjusted using an inflation\nrate, such as those that are calculated and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics within the consumer\nprice index (CPI).\nA concept referred to as the Fisher effect, named for economist Irving Fisher, describes the relationship\nbetween inflation and the nominal and real interest rates and is expressed using the following formula:\nwhere i is the nominal interest rate, R is the real interest rate, and h is the expected inflation rate.\nAn example of the Fisher effect would be seen in the case of a bond investor who is expecting a real interest\nrate of return of 6% on the bond, in an economy that is experiencing an expected inflation rate of 2%. Using\nthe above formula, we have\nSo, the nominal interest rate on the bond amounts to 8.12%, with a real interest rate of 6% within an economy\nthat is experiencing a 2% inflation rate. This is a logical result because in a scenario of positive inflation, a real\nrate of return would always be expected to amount to less than the stated or nominal rate.\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n217\nInterest and Savings\nSavings are adversely affected by negative real interest rates. A person who holds money in the form of cash is\nactually losing future purchasing value when real interest rates are negative. A saver who decides to hold\n$1,000 in the form of cash for one year at a negative real interest rate of −3.65% per year will lose\nor $36.50, in purchasing power by the end of that year.\nOrdinarily, interest rates would rise to compensate for negative real rates, but this might not happen if the\nFederal Reserve takes steps to maintain low interest rates to help stimulate and stabilize the economy. When\ninterest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury and money market investments due\nto their extremely poor returns.\nIt soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and\ndirect impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this",

If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples\nwe have already covered. In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\nrate. Note that we represent r as the interest paid per period\nand n as the number\nof periods (12 months in a year;\n) rather than the number of years, which is only one.\nContinuing with our example, that same $1,000 in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four\ntimes a year, would grow to\nin one year. Note that this final amount ends up\nbeing greater than the annually compounded future value of $1,060.00 and slightly less than the monthly\n218\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompounded future value of $1.061.67, which would appear to make logical sense.\nThe total differences in future values among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding in these examples\nare insignificant, amounting to less than $1.70 in total. However, when working with larger amounts, higher\ninterest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms, compounding periods and frequency\nbecome far more important and can generate some exceptionally large differences in future values.\nTen million dollars at 12% growth for one year and compounded annually amounts to\n, while 10 million dollars on the same terms but compounded quarterly will\nproduce\n. Most wealthy and rational investors and savers would be\nvery pleased to earn that additional $55,088.10 by simply having their funds in an account that features\nquarterly compounding.\nIn another example, $200 at 60% interest, compounded annually for six years, becomes\n, while this same amount compounded quarterly grows to\n.\nAn amount of $1 at 3%, compounded annually for 100 years, will be worth\n. The same\ndollar at the same interest rate, compounded monthly over the course of a century, will grow to\n.\nThis would all seem to make sense due to the fact that in situations when compounding increases in\nfrequency, interest income is being received during the year as opposed to at the end of the year and thus\ngrows more rapidly to become a larger and more valuable sum of money. This is important because we know\nthrough the concept of TVM that having money now is more useful to us than having that same amount of\nmoney at some later point in time.\nThe Rule of 72\nThe rule of 72 is a simple and often very useful mathematical shortcut that can help you estimate the impact of\nany interest or growth rate and can be used in situations ranging from financial calculations to projections of\npopulation growth.

In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of\n, or 14.4%.\nThrough these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can\nhave significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\nTo further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s\ngross domestic product is growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n219\ntake the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\nNow, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in\n, or 36, years. However, if the rate of\ngrowth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in\n, or 6.55, years. By performing such\ncalculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\ngrowth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation\nand development.\nIt is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings\namounts that are earning interest.\nTo apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers\nwould lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in\n, or about 10.3,\nyears.\nIn an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of\n24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\nyou owe to the credit card company will double in only\n, or 3, years.\nSo, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage\npoint in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic\nforecasting models.\nIt is important to understand that the rule of 72 can be applied in any scenario where we have a quantity or an\namount that is in the process of growing or is expected to grow for any period of time into the future. A good\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in\nor\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only\n, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\nInvesting and Risk\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.",

It’s common for a term loan to be backed by collateral, such as the asset\nitself or other assets of the business.\n•\nRevolving lines of credit (revolvers), are used to finance the short-term working capital needs of a\nbusiness. Revolvers will have a specific maximum but no set schedule of monthly payments. Interest\naccrues on the amount of cash that a company has drawn down from the facility. These credit lines may\nbe secured by accounts receivable, inventory, other assets of the business, or sometimes simply the good\n8.3 • Loan Amortization\n239\nfaith and credit of the company if the firm is strong, creditworthy, and established with the lender.\nRevolvers must often be fully repaid and unused for a short period of time to assure the lender that the\nborrower is not using this facility for longer-term needs.\nPersonal loans also come in several types, designed for the purpose the borrower (consumer) has in mind,\nwith assistance from the lender in determining the appropriate structure:\n•\nPersonal lines of credit are similar to lines of credit on bank cards, with interest being charged on the\noutstanding balance of the credit line. These are available on the basis of personal credit scores, with data\nbeing supplied by the three best-known credit reporting firms: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.\nIndividuals should check their scores with each of these companies at least once per year, which they can\ndo for no charge. Additional requests from the same company require a small fee.\n•\nAn unsecured personal loan is an installment loan, initially drawn for a fixed amount and repaid on a\nperiodic schedule with interest, as we have seen in our annuity examples. Unsecured means that the loan\nis not secured by collateral but is instead based on the strong credit history of the borrower.\n•\nIn contrast, a secured personal loan has an asset backing up the unpaid amount, and if the consumer\ndefaults on the debt, the asset can be seized by the lender to satisfy their claim. A common example is an\nauto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the\nborrower’s car being repossessed.\n•\nA mortgage loan is another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even\n30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the\nborrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance\nremains on the debt.\n•\nStudent loans are borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a\nfinancial institution or the federal government. Interest rates on these loans are generally low and\nadvantageous, and repayment does not begin until after the borrower’s education is complete (or if they\ndrop below a certain level of time status, such as becoming a half-time student).\nCalculating Loan Payments Using Simple Amortization\nLoan amortization refers to a schedule of how and when a debt will be repaid with interest. As noted, we will\nfocus on fixed-rate debts, such as auto loans, personal loans with installment payments, or mortgages. Before\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into\nbusiness or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area of Time Value of Money I.\nWe’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a\nmonthly basis. Fortunately, our formulas are easily adjusted from annual to non-annual periods. You will recall\nthat we solve for non-annual periods in the same way, with two adjustments: (1) we divide the annual interest\nrate by the number of periods in the year, and (2) we multiply the time periods by the number of those periods\nwithin a year. Therefore, in the case of monthly debt service, including interest and principal, we use 12\nperiods.\nGiven a three-year car loan at 6%, rather than using 6% and 3 periods in our formula, we would instead use\n0.5% (6% ÷ 12) and 36 periods (3 years × 12), and then apply the present value of an annuity formula in the\nsame way. Let’s say the three-year, 6% auto loan is for $32,000. You need to know if you can squeeze the\nmonthly payment into your budget. For our examples, we will ignore any other charges, fees, taxes, or extras\nthat your lender might include in these payments, and we will focus only on interest and principal repayment.\n240\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nYou will make the first payment one month from now, making this an ordinary annuity.

The length of the loan, coupled with the frequent compounding,\nemphasizes this. In month 10, the interest and principal amounts “pass” each other, and now the loan balance\nis dropping at a quicker rate. Finally, note that you will pay more than $56,000 to finance this $140,000\nborrowing. If you pay off this mortgage over 240 months as planned, the interest cost represents an additional\n28% of the full cost of the home!\nIf the borrower has the means to make an accelerated payment against this debt—for example, due to a\nbonus or other windfall—doing so can make a significant difference in the total cost of financing over the life\nof the loan. Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015.

This section will explore examples of both,\nbeginning with financial calculators. While understanding and mastery of the use of time value of money\nequations are part of a solid foundation in the study of business and personal finance, calculators are rapid\nand efficient.\nWe’ll begin with the constant perpetuity that we used to illustrate the constant perpetuity formula. A share of\npreferred stock of Shaw Inc., pays an annual $2.00 dividend, and the required rate of return that investors in\nthis stock expect is 7%. The simple technique to solve this problem using the calculator is shown in Table 8.7.\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults 2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER RST\n0.00\n2\nEnter formula\n2 ÷ 7 % =\n28.57\nTable 8.7 Calculator Steps to Find the Required Rate of Return3\nEarlier we solved for the present value of a 5-year ordinary annuity of $25,000 earning 8% annually. We then\nsolved for an annuity due, all other facts remaining the same. The two solutions were $99,817.50 and\n$107,802.50, respectively.

In addition, we follow the payment amount of $25,000 with the +/-\nkeystroke—an optional step to see the final present value result as a positive value.\nTo perform the same calculation as an annuity due, we can perform the same procedures as above, but with\ntwo additional steps after Step 1 to change the default from payments at the end of each period to payments\nat the beginning of each period (see Table 8.9).\n3\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n246\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults\n2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER\nRST\n0.00\n2\nChange default to payment at end of period 2ND\n2ND [BGN] 2ND\n2ND [SET] BGN\n0.00\n3\nReturn to calculator mode\n2ND\n2ND [QUIT]\n0.00\n4\nEnter number of payments\n5 NN\nN =\n5.00\n5\nEnter interest rate per payment period\n8 I/Y\nI/Y\nI/Y =\n8.00\n6\nEnter payment amount\n25000 +/- PMT\n+/- PMT\nPMT = -25,000.00\n7\nCompute present value\nCPT PV\nCPT PV\nPV =\n107,803.17\nTable 8.9 Calculator Steps to Solve for an Annuity Due\nThe procedures to find future values of both ordinary annuities and annuities due are comparable to the two\nprocedures above.

One simple way to prove this is by using the calculator keystrokes listed in Table\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n247\n8.12.\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults\n2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER\nRST\n0.00\n2\nSet the display to four decimal places 2ND\n2ND [FORMAT] 4 ENTER\n4 ENTER DEC = 4.0000\n3\nReturn to calculator mode\n2ND\n2ND [QUIT]\n0.0000\n4\nEnter (1 + the monthly interest rate)\n1.015 YYXX\n1.0150\n5\nEnter the number of months\n12 YYXX\n1.1956\nTable 8.12 Calculator Steps to Prove the Actual Rate of Interest per Year\nHad we assumed that the stated monthly interest rate of 1.5% could be simply multiplied by 12 months for an\nannual rate of 18%, we would be ignoring the effect of more frequent compounding. As indicated above, the\nannual interest on the money that we spent initially, accumulating at a rate of 1.5% per month, is 19.56%, not\n18%:\nThe final example in this chapter will represent the amortization of a loan. Using a 36-month auto loan for\n$32,000 at 6% per year compounded monthly, we can easily find the monthly payment and the amortization of\nthis loan on our calculator using the following procedures and keystrokes.\nFirst, we find the monthly payment (see Table 8.13).\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults\n2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER RST\n0.00\n2\nSet payments per year to 12\n2ND\n2ND [P/Y] 12 ENTER\nENTER P/Y =\n12.00\n3\nReturn to calculator mode\n2ND\n2ND [QUIT]\n0.00\n4\nEnter number of payments with the payment multiplier 3 2ND\n2ND [xP/Y] NN\nN =\n36.00\n5\nEnter annual interest rate\n6 I/Y\nI/Y\nI/Y =\n6.00\n6\nEnter loan amount\n32000 PV\nPV\nPV =\n32,000.00\n7\nCompute the monthly payment\nCPT\nCPT PMT\nPMT\nPMT =\n-973.50\nTable 8.13 Calculator Steps to Find the Monthly Payment of a Loan\nWe’ve verified the amount of our monthly debt service, including both the interest and repayment of the\nprincipal, as $973.50.

With some practice, a long table such as that can be constructed\nby even a relatively new user in less than 10 minutes.\nIn this section, we will illustrate how to use Excel to solve problems from earlier in the chapter, including\nperpetuities, ordinary annuities, effective interest rates, and loan amortization. We will omit the basic\ndynamics of an Excel spreadsheet because they were presented sufficiently in preceding chapters.\nRevisiting the constant perpetuity from Section 8.1, in which our shares of Shaw Inc., preferred stock pay an\nannual fixed dividend of $2.00 and the required rate of return is 7%, we do not use an Excel function for this\nsimple operation. The two values are entered in cells B3 and B4, respectively.\nWe enter a formula in cell B6 to perform the division and display the result in that cell. The actual contents of\ncell B6 are typed below it for your reference, in cell B8 (see Figure 8.2).\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n249\nFigure 8.2 Excel Spreadsheet for Valuing a Perpetuity\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file_Chapter08_finance) containing\nkey Chapter 8 Excel exhibits.\nTo find the present value of an ordinary annuity, we revisit Section 8.2.1. You will draw $25,000 at the end of\neach year for five years from a fund earning 8% annually, and you want to know how much you need in that\nfund today to accomplish this. We accomplish this in Excel easily with the PV function. The format of the PV\ncommand is\n=PV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nOnly the first three arguments inside the parentheses are used. We’ll place them in cells and refer to those\ncells in our PV function. As an option, you could also type the numbers into the parentheses directly. Notice\nthe slight rounding error because of decimal expansion. Also, the payment must be entered as a negative\nnumber for your result to be positive; this can be accomplished either by making the $25,000 in cell B5 a\nnegative amount or by placing a minus sign in front of the B5 in the formula’s arguments. In cell B3, you must\nenter the percent either as 0.08 or as 8% (with the percent sign). We repeated the formula syntax and the\nactual formula inputs in column A near the result, for your reference (see Figure 8.3).\nFigure 8.3 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nWe also found the present value of an annuity due. We use the same information from the ordinary annuity\nproblem above, but you will recall that the first of five payments happens immediately at the start of year 1,\nnot at the end. We follow the same procedures and inputs as in the previous example, but with one change to\nthe PV function: the last argument in the parentheses will change from 0 to 1. This is a toggle switch that\ncommands the PV function to treat this as an annuity due instead of an ordinary annuity (see Figure 8.4).\n250\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.4 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nSection 8.2 introduced us to future values. Comparable to the PV function above, Excel provides the FV\nfunction. Using the same information—$3,000 invested annually for five years, starting one year from now, at\n4%—we’ll solve using Excel (see Figure 8.5). The format of the command is\n=FV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nFigure 8.5 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nAs with present values, using the same data but solving for an annuity due requires the fifth argument inside\nthe parentheses to be changed from 0 to 1; all other values remain the same (see Figure 8.6).\nFigure 8.6 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Annuity Due\nIn Section 8.4, we explained the difference between stated and effective rates of interest to show the true cost\nof borrowing, in this case for a one-year period, if interest is compounded for periods within a year.

The syntax\nfor the Excel effect function to calculate this rate is\n=EFFECT(rate,periods)\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n251\nwhere rate is the nominal rate and periods represents the number of periods within a year.\nEarlier, our example showed that 1.5% compounded monthly results in not 18% per year but actually over\n19.56% (see Figure 8.7).\nFigure 8.7 Excel Spreadsheet Showing Effective Interest Rate\nNote several things: First, the nominal interest rate is entered as a percent. Second, the actual effect function\nin C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the word rate because we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so\nExcel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9, rate\nremains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.\nTo assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the\nanchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we\nuse the name rate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place\nthe cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the\ncurrent cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then\nhit the enter key, the value in that box will change to rate. Now, if you type “rate” (again, without quotation\nmarks) into a formula, Excel knows to use the contents of cell B3.\nExcel provides convenient tools for figuring out amortization. We’ll revisit our 36-month auto loan for $32,000\nat 6% per year, compounded monthly. A loan amortization table for a fixed interest rate debt is usually\nformatted as follows, with the Interest and Principal columns interchangeable:\nPeriod\nPayment\nInterest\nPrincipal\nBalance\nIn Excel, a table is completed by using the function PMT. The individual steps follow.\n1.\nList the information about the loan in the upper left of the worksheet, and create the column headings for\nthe schedule of amortization. Type “B5” (without the quotation marks) in cell E9 to begin the schedule.\nThen enter 1 for the first month under the Payment # (or Month) column, in cell A10 (see Figure 8.8).\n252\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.8 Step 1 of Creating an Amortization Table\n2.\nNext, in cell B10, the payment is derived from the formula =PMT(rate,periods,pv), with PV representing the\npresent value, or the loan amount. Because we are compounding monthly, enter C$2 and C$3 for the rate\nand periods, respectively. Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in\nfront of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers.

In all cases, the payments in the stream were\nidentical. If they had not been identical, a separate set of operators would be required, and these will be\naddressed in the next chapter.\n256\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n8.1 Perpetuities\nA perpetuity is an investment that is intended to provide an expected return indefinitely, either remaining\nconstant or growing by an incremental amount. Preferred stock is a common example with a preestablished\ndividend formula. An indefinite stream of payments cannot be compounded into a future value, but it can be\ndiscounted to a present value, providing an opportunity to determine the amount an investor should be\nwilling to pay for a share of that stock.\n8.2 Annuities\nAn annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments that is expected to be paid or received. Calculations of future\nvalue or present value are commonly performed on these payment streams for a wide number of reasons in\nbusiness and personal financial analysis, as seen in the chapter focusing on single amounts, particularly in\nloan repayment. Annuities may be ordinary annuities, in which the first cash flow of a series occurs at the end\nof the first period, or annuities due, if the first cash flow occurs at the beginning point of the first period.\n8.3 Loan Amortization\nLoans are contracts between a lender and a borrower. Failure to observe the rules of that contract, such as\npayment of interest or repayment of the amount owed, can subject the borrower to substantial penalties as\nwell as damage to their credit. Loan agreements bearing a fixed rate of interest have a scheduled\namortization, or rate and time of repayments with interest. Several types of business and personal loans were\ndescribed.\n8.4 Stated versus Effective Rates\nFor a borrower to understand the true cost of financing, they must be familiar with interannual compounding,\nwhich can cause a stated interest rate that appears to be annual to actually be higher. The effective rate of\ninterest was demonstrated to understand that true cost.\n8.5 Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\nThe use of two tools for managing and understanding the time value of money and its many applications was\ndiscussed: a professional financial calculator and the popular Microsoft Office Suite spreadsheet application\nExcel.\nKey Terms\nannuity\na stream of regular, periodic payments to be received or paid\nannuity due\na stream of periodic payments in which the payment or receipt occurs at the beginning of each\nperiod\nconstant perpetuity\na stream of periodic payments that is expected to continue indefinitely with no change\nin the amount paid or received\ndiscount rate\nan interest rate used in time value of money calculations to determine present value; may\nderive from several sources, such as stated contract rates, costs to borrow, or expected rates of return on\ninvestments\neffective interest rate\nthe interest rate that results when compounding occurs multiple times within a year;\nthe true cost of borrowing\ngrowing perpetuity\na stream of periodic payments that is expected to continue indefinitely with growth of",

Keeping in mind that we have not yet\nexplored the use of Excel, is there another way to view our solution? The problem above takes each annual\ninvestment and compounds it into the future, then adds the results of each calculation to find the total future\nvalue of the stream of payments.\nBut when you break the problem down, another way to look at the problem is as a five-year annuity of $10,000\nper year plus added payments in years 4 and 5. Can we solve for the future value of an annuity first and then\nperform two separate calculations on the additional amounts ($5,000 each in years 4 and 5)? Yes, we can.\nLet’s summarize:\n•\nFuture value of a $10,000 annuity due, 4%, 5 years, plus\n•\nFuture value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 2 years, plus\n•\nFuture value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 1 year\nThis must give us the same result. The formula for the future value of an annuity due is\nThis problem can be solved in the three steps of the summary above.\nStep 1:\nStep 2:\nStep 3:\nCombining the results from each of the three steps gives us\nIt works.

When you take your last payment of\n$18,000, your fund will be totally depleted. You will always be earning 6% annually. How much of your cash\nwindfall should you set aside today to accomplish this?\nLet us break down the problem, remembering that we are thinking in reverse from the earlier problems that\ninvolved future values. In this case, we’re bringing future values back in time to find their present values. You\nwill recall that this process is called discounting rather than compounding.\nRegardless of how we solve this, the question remains the same: How much money must we invest today\n(present value) to achieve this? And remember that we will always be earning 6% compounded annually on\nany invested balances.\n9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows\n267\nWe are calculating present values as we did in previous chapters, given a known future value “target,” in order\nto determine how much money you need today to achieve that goal. Let us break this down by first reviewing\nthe relevant equations from previous chapters.\nPresent value of an ordinary annuity:\nPresent value of a single amount:\nwhere PVa is the present value of an annuity, PYMT is one payment in a consistent stream (an annuity), i is the\ninterest rate (annual unless otherwise specified), n is the number of periods, PV is the present value of a single\namount, and FV is the future value of a single amount.\nYou want to find out how much money you need to set aside today to accomplish your goal. You can also find\nout how much money you need to set aside in each period to accomplish this goal. Therefore, we can address\nthis problem in increments. Let us look at potential solutions.\nFirst, we will break this down into the cash flows of each year. Table 9.5 shows the timing of the future cash\nflows you’re expecting:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nExpected Amount to Be Withdrawn at End of Year $0.00 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,500 $18,000\nTable 9.5\nOne method is to take each year’s cash flows, which happen at the end of the year, and discount them to\ntoday using the present value formula for a single amount:\nBecause year 1’s withdrawal from your fund only has one year to earn interest, we discounted it for one year.\nThe second amount is discounted for two years:\nThe next three years are discounted in the same way, for three, four, and five years, respectively:\nNotice how we reverse our thinking on the exponent n from our approach to future value. This time, it\nincreases each period because we discount each future amount for a longer period to arrive at the value in\ntoday’s dollars.\nWhen we add all five discounted present value amounts from above, we derive today’s value of $72,753.49.\nExpressed more simply, if you wanted to extract the specified stream of cash flows at the end of each year\n268\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n($17,000 for three years, then $17,500, then $18,000), you would have to begin with $72,753.49. The thing to\nremember is that any amounts remaining in this fund, regardless of how you deplete it, will always be earning\n6% annually. See Table 9.6.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nWithdrawn at End of Year\n$17,000.00 $17,000.00 $17,000.00 $17,500.00 $18,000.00\nInterest on Balance\n$4,365.21\n$3,607.12\n$2,803.55\n$1,951.76\n$1,018.87\nRemaining Balance\n$72,753.49 $60,118.70 $46,725.82 $32,529.37 $16,981.13\n$0.00\nTable 9.6\nLet us try another approach. Because the amount of cash withdrawn in the first three years remains constant\nat $17,000, it can be viewed as an annuity—specifically, a three-period annuity of $17,000 and two single\npayments of $17,500 and $18,000. Therefore, we could also discount (bring to present value) an annuity of\n$17,000 for three years (the first three) and then combine it with the year 4 discounted amount and the year 5\ndiscounted amount. We can try it using the formulas for PVa and PVused above. In Step 1, we will discount the\nfirst three years as an annuity (ordinary, as the first withdrawal is not made until one year from now); in Step 2,\nwe will discount the year 4 single payment amount; and in Step 3, we will do the same for the year 5 single\npayment amount. Then we can add them together.\nStep 1: Find the present value of the annuity using the PVa formula:\nStep 2: Discount the year 4 amount using the formula for the present value of a single amount:\nStep 3: Perform the same operation as in Step 2 for the year 5 amount:",

All cash flows are discounted at 4%. You are told by your\nfinancial advisor to expect cash inflows from your investment of $100,000 in year 1, $125,000 in year 2,\n$175,000 in year 3, $90,000 in year 4, and $50,000 in year 5. Would you agree to this plan based only on the\nnumbers? Each amount will be withdrawn at the end of every year, and interest will be compounded\nannually.\nSolution:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nExpected Amount to Be Withdrawn at End of Year $0.00 $100,000 $125,000 $175,000 $90,000 $50,000\nTable 9.7\nApplying the formula for the present value of a single amount, we discount each amount and then add the\ndiscounted amounts. We will simplify this approach with Excel shortly, but we must understand the\nreasoning behind discounting uneven cash flow streams with a direct solution.\nBy combining the five discounted amounts above, we get a total present value of $485,326.48. This amount\nrepresents the value today of the five expected cash inflows for as long as our remaining balance is earning\n4%.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThoughts on Cash Flow from Irina Simmons\nIn 2013, the author interviewed Irina Simmons, senior vice president, chief risk officer, and former treasurer\nof EMC Corporation. The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\nhigher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\nventures?\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.",

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments\navailable to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,\nBonds and Bond Valuation\n10\n10 • Why It Matters\n283\nadding a degree of safety and diversity to their investment mix.\n10.1\nCharacteristics of Bonds\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nList and define the basic characteristics of bonds.\n•\nList and describe the various types of bonds available.\n•\nExplain how a bond price is inversely related to its return (yield).\nBonds as Investments\nOne way to look at bond investments is to consider the fact that any investor who purchases a bond is\nessentially buying a future cash flow stream that the bond issuer (or borrower) promises to make as per\nagreement.\nBecause bonds provide a set amount of cash inflow to their owners, they are often called fixed-income\nsecurities. Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•\nPar value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284",

The final column gives the bond rating, a grade that indicates credit quality. As we\nprogress through this chapter, we will examine prices, coupon rates, yields, and bond ratings in more\ndetail\nTypes of Bonds\nThere are three primary categories of bonds, though the specifics of these different types of bond can vary\ndepending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest rate, and risk.\nGovernment Bonds\nThe safest category of bonds are short-term US Treasury bills (T-bills). These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGovernment Bonds\nReview this introductory video (https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices) about government bonds.\nMunicipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors. Though the global fixed-income debt\nmarket remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond\nmarkets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some\nexperts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only\n(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.\nThe chart in Figure 10.2 provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own\nconclusions about these markets.\nFigure 10.2 Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020 (data source: Nasdaq)\nWhile the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past\nseveral years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.",

This makes logical sense when one considers that an investment in a bond involves\na series of future cash inflows, or payments from the bond issuer to the bondholder over the term of the\nbond’s maturity.\nTo determine the value of a bond today, the two-step time value of money calculation we discussed earlier\nmust be used, and the present value of a series of coupon payments (or an annuity) must be determined. This\npresent value amount will then be added to the present value of a single lump sum payment (the principal or\nface value) that will come to the bondholder at the end of the bond’s term (maturity).\nFixed Income\nBecause standard fixed-rate bonds have their coupon payments and maturity amounts locked in, they are\noften referred to as fixed-income investments. This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\ncompared to stocks.\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n291\nWhile yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are\ncurrently low because the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) has kept interest rates low for several years,\ninvestors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.2 This is especially true as investors enter their\nretirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks. Because income from most bonds is fixed, such instruments can have\ntheir values eroded by external factors such as interest rates and inflation. We will discuss some of these risks\nafter the next section.\nPeriod\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nEnd Date 6/30/20 12/31/20 6/30/21 12/31/21 6/30/22 12/31/22 6/30/23 12/31/23 6/30/24 12/31/24\nCoupon\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\nPrincipal\n$100,000\nTable 10.4\nTable 10.4 shows the cash inflow of a five-year, 9%, $100,000 corporate bond dated January 1, 2020.

The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the\ninterest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s\nfuture cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.\nAs we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the",

This is because yields on\nfixed-income investments such as bonds will rise as maturity periods increase and produce greater levels of\nrisk.\nCorporate issuers of bonds will usually offer bond issues at higher yields that the government, which is\nunderstandable because they are potentially riskier for investors. Government securities are guaranteed by\ngovernments and have little to no chance of default or nonpayment. This is not the case for corporate bonds,\nwhere there is always a chance of default, though the likelihood of this occurring will vary by individual\ncompany or issuer as well as by bond type and term. We will discuss bond default and default risk next.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Yield Curve\nReview this video (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-the-yield-curve) that introduces the concept of\nthe yield curve.\n10.3 • Using the Yield Curve\n297\nDifferent Shapes of the Yield Curve\nThere are two important elements to any yield curve that will define its shape: its level and its slope. The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-\nincome investments, such as the purchase of bond issues. Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a\nnegative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but\nthe curve inverted in March 2019 as yields on short-term bonds exceeded those of longer-term bonds,\nresulting in concerns surrounding impending recession and other economic problems. This inverted shape\nto the yield curve continued into 2020, as evidenced in Figure 10.9.\nFigure 10.8 The Economy Shifts to an Inverted Yield Curve (data source: US Department of the Treasury, Resource Center,\nDaily Treasury Yield Curve Rates)\nYield curves constructed on different days in early 2020 appeared similar to the examples below.

This remains the\nfastest declaration by the committee on record since the founding of the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch (NBER) in 1978.4\nIn July 2021, the committee declared that the economy had reached a trough in April 2020, marking the end\nof the recession of the early 2020s and making it the shortest US recession on record as well as the most\nquickly identified one.5\n(sources: www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/business/yield-curve-recession-indicator.html; www.nber.org/\nnews/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-june-8-2020; fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2020/11/are-\nwe-still-in-a-recession/)\nA flat shape for the yield curve occurs when there is not a great deal of difference between short-term and\nlong-term yields (see Figure 10.10).

If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\n•\nDuration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n301\n•\nCall risk and reinvestment risk. Call risk is the risk of bonds being redeemed or called by the issuing\nfirm before their maturity dates. Corporations may elect to call a bond issue (provided the bond issue has\na call feature) when interest rates drop and companies are in a position to save a great deal of money by\nissuing new bonds with lower coupon rates. To investors, this is a risk in and of itself, but call risk also has\nthe effect of potentially causing reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is defined as the risk to investors\nwhen they find themselves facing unfavorable alternatives for investing the proceeds from their called\nbonds in new, lower-paying investments. This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\noriginal bond investors.\n•\nTerm risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues. We will\ndiscuss these bond ratings and the companies that issue them next.\nBond Ratings and Rating Providers\nIt is important for investors to know the risks they are assuming when investing in bonds. Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.",

The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to\nissue them to raise capital. In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political\nmovement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets. This movement,\ncombined with illegal insider trading activities conducted by investments banks, ultimately resulted in the\nbankruptcy of former financial giant Drexel Burnham Lambert.6\nS&P / Fitch Moody’s\nGrade\nMeaning\nAAA\nAaa\nInvestment Risk almost zero\nAA\nAa\nInvestment Low risk\nA\nA\nInvestment Risky if economy declines\nBBB\nBaa\nInvestment Some risk; more if economy declines\nBB\nBa\nSpeculative Risky\nB\nB\nSpeculative Risky; expected to get worse\nCCC\nCaa\nSpeculative Probably bankruptcy\nCC\nCa\nSpeculative Probably bankruptcy\nC\nC\nSpeculative In bankruptcy or default\nD\nSpeculative In bankruptcy or default\nTable 10.11 Bond Ratings (sources: S&P Global Ratings; Moody’s)\nThe market for junk bonds enjoyed a brief resurgence in popularity when the economy improved later in the\n1990s. However, in 2001, the junk bond market shrank once again, resulting in 11% of US junk bond issues\ndefaulting.\nIn general, it is important to understand that bond ratings are only judgments on corporations’ future ability\nto repay debt obligation and their growth prospects. There is no fixed methodology or basis for calculating a\nbond rating. However, some financial analysts can get a strong indication of how a bond will be rated by\nexamining certain financial ratios of the issuing firm, such as company debt ratio, earnings-to-interest ratio,\nand their return on assets.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Collapse of Enron: Bond and Credit Ratings and How They Change\nThe bond rating system is not infallible. A perfect example of this is when energy giant Enron failed in 2001.\nAfter the collapse, investors correctly pointed out that a mere two months before this occurred, the\ncompany’s bonds were rated as investment grade and considered relatively safe, having little risk for\ninvestors.\nBackground on Enron\nFrom its formation in 1985 through the late 1990s, Enron grew to become an energy mega-conglomerate,\n6\nLawrence Delevingne. “The Drexel Collapse, 25 Years Later.” CNBC.

The\ncombination of all of these irregularities and issues resulted in the December 2, 2001, bankruptcy of the\ncorporation.7 It was later determined that the majority of these unethical issues had been perpetuated with\nthe indirect knowledge or even, in some cases, by the direct actions of the board of directors or senior\noperational management of the company.\nSpecifics and Enron’s Bond Ratings\nOn October 27, 2001, the company began buying back all its commercial paper, valued at around $3.3\nbillion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron’s supply of cash. On November 8, Enron announced\nthat restatements to its financial statements for the years 1997–2000 were necessary to correct several\naccounting violations. However, by November 28, 2001, credit rating agencies had reduced Enron’s bond\nrating to junk status.8\nOther Examples of Significant Bond Ratings Downgrades\nSome companies that have recently experienced downgrades (or potential downgrades) to their credit and\nbond ratings include Delta Airlines, Ford, Occidental Petroleum, Carnival Cruises, and T-Mobil. Some of\nthese businesses, such as Delta and Carnival, are suffering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the\nhope is that they don’t experience the same disastrous fate as Enron.\n(sources: www.britannica.com/event/Enron-scandal; www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2002/apr/\ntheriseandfallofenron.html; corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/enron-scandal/;\nwww.wsj.com/articles/corporate-bond-downgrades-grow-as-coronavirus-spreads-11585849497)\nConcepts of Bond Returns\nBond investors earn profits through two different means: collecting interest income and generating capital\ngains. These are important concepts for any investor who considers putting their money in fixed-income\nsecurities such as bonds.\n7\nDouglas O. Linder. “Enron (Lay & Skilling) Trial (2006).” Famous Trials. Accessed November 24, 2021. https://famous-trials.com/\nenron\n8\nPaul M. Healy and Krishna G. Palepu. “The Fall of Enron.” Journal of Economic Perspectives 17, no. 2 (Spring 2003): 3–26.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1257/089533003765888403\n304\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCollecting Interest Income\nAs we have covered, when investors buy bonds, they are lending money to bond issuers. The coupon rate of a\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor\npurchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive\n20 coupon payments equal to\nor\nfor a total of $1,000.\nDepending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation\nresulting in significant realized return for the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could",

If we wanted to use an Excel spreadsheet to perform this calculation instead of a calculator, we\nwould set up our spreadsheet as shown in the steps below. The current bond price, entered as a negative,\nis ($952.06). The bond face value of FV is $1,000; the time period is\n, or 14 semiannual periods;\nthe coupon rate is\n, or 0.05%; and the coupon payment is $5.00.\n1.\nFirst, select Formulas from the Excel upper menu bar, and from the dialog box, select Rate (see Figure\n10.16).\nFigure 10.16 Using Excel to Enter a Rate Function\n10.5 • Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\n309\n2.\nAfter the dialog box appears, enter the variables or arguments.

Once satisfied with the result, you can hit Enter to insert this final\ncalculated value into your spreadsheet. This has been set up in this sheet in cell H10.\nAs noted above, remember that this is a semiannual rate because it was calculated using semiannual\ncoupon payments and periods. To express it as an annual YTM rate, you must multiply it by 2.\nCalculating the Maturity Period (Term) of a Bond\nYou can use the following steps in Excel to determine the maturity period or term of a bond. Assume that you\nare considering investing in a bond that is selling for $820.00, has a face value of $1,000, and has an annual\ncoupon rate of 3%.

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call\na feature of certain bonds or other fixed-income instruments that allows the issuer to repurchase\nand retire these instruments before maturity\nbond price\nthe present, discounted value of the future cash stream generated by a bond; the sum of the\npresent values of all likely coupon payments and the present value of the par value at maturity\nbond ratings\ngrades assigned to bonds by rating services that indicate their overall credit quality\nBusiness Cycle Dating Committee\na subdivision of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the\nUS government agency that maintains a chronology of US business cycles\ncall risk",

Yet it is important\nto realize that stock has some significant disadvantages, which can include the following:\n•\nGeneral risk levels are greater than with bonds or other fixed-income investments.\n•\nTiming the buy-and-sell transactions of stock can be tricky and may lead to losses or not taking full\nadvantage of share price opportunities.\n•\nDividends (provided that the stock does indeed pay them, as not all do) are uncertain and subject to\nchange based on decisions of company management.\nWe will discuss these topics in this chapter and cover many of the details regarding why corporations issue\ncommon stock and why investors purchase that stock.\n11.1\nMultiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate a P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio given company data.\n•\nDetermine relative under- or overvaluation indicated by a P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio.\n•\nDefine and calculate a P/B (price-to-book) ratio given company data.\n•\nDetermine relative under- or overvaluation indicated by a P/B (price-to-book) ratio.\n•\nDefine and detail alternative valuation multipliers, including P/S (price-to-sales) ratio, P/CF (price-to-cash-\nflow) ratio, and dividend yield.\nThe Price-to Earnings (P/E) Ratio\nExperienced investors use a number of different methods to evaluate information on companies and their\ncommon stock before deciding on any potential purchase. One of the most popular techniques used by\ninvestors and analysts is to study a company’s financial statements in order to uncover basic fundamental\ninformation on the company. This involves calculating a number of financial ratios that help identify trends,\nbringing elements of operational performance to light and allowing for clearer analysis and evaluation.\nA well-proven analytical approach for investors to use in evaluating common stock is to review the overall\nmarket value of the company that issues a stock. One of the most consistently used calculations in this\nanalysis, which has important applications in company and common stock evaluation, is the price-to-earnings\n(P/E) ratio.\nThe P/E ratio is computed using the following formula:\n320\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe P/E ratio is extremely useful to analysts in that it shows the expectations of the market. Essentially, the P/E\nratio is representative of the price an investor must pay for every unit of current (or future) corporate\nearnings.\nBottom-line earnings are a critical factor in valuing common stock. Investors will always want to know how\nprofitable a company is now as well as how profitable it will be in the future. When a company’s bottom line\nremains relatively flat over a period of time, leaving earnings per share (EPS) relatively unchanged, the P/E\nratio can be interpreted as the payback period for the original amount paid for each share of common stock.\nFor example, the common stock price of Cameo Corp. is currently at $24.00 a share, and its EPS for the year is\n$4.00. Cameo’s P/E ratio is calculated as\nThis ratio would typically be expressed in the form\n. Essentially, this means that investors are willing to pay\nup to six dollars for every one dollar of earnings. It can also be stated that Cameo stock is currently trading at\na multiple of six.\nThe P/E ratio is typically expressed in two primary ways. The first is as a metric listed by most finance websites\nand often carries the notation P/E (ttm). This refers to the Wall Street acronym for “trailing 12 months” and\nsignals the company’s operating performance over the past 12 months.\nAnother form of the P/E ratio is known as the forward (or leading) P/E. This uses future earnings projections\nrather than actual trailing amounts. The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the\ndenominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.\nAnalyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when\na company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry\nthat it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as",

Because of these\ndiscrepancies in interpretation and overall variance of opinion, the use of alternate stock valuation metrics,\neither in addition to or in place of the P/B ratio, is always worth exploring.\nIn conclusion, the P/B ratio can help a company understand if its net assets are comparable to the market\nprice of its stock. However, as with the P/E ratio, it is always a good idea to compare P/B ratios of companies\nwithin the same industry and use them in conjunction with other metrics and analytical methodologies.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio and Price-to-Book Ratio\nTwo videos cover the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (https://openstax.org/r/price-to-earnings) and the price-\nto-book (P/B) ratio (https://openstax.org/r/price-to-book_ratio). These are excellent introductory videos\nthat will provide you with helpful information on what these ratios represent and how they can be used in\nstock valuation.\n322\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAlternative Multipliers\nThere are two main types of valuation metrics multiples used to value common stock. These are equity\nmultiples and enterprise value (EV) multiples. Additionally, there are two primary methods by which to\nperform analysis using these multiples. These methods are comparable company analysis (comps) and\nprecedent transaction analysis (precedents).\nExperienced financial analysts advocate the use of multiples in valuation analysis for a number of reasons, the\nmost important being that they help generate realistic and sound judgments of enterprise values (total\ncompany values), they are relatively easy to use and interpret, and they can provide helpful information on a\ncompany’s overall financial condition when used appropriately.\nHowever, it should be noted that simplicity may have some important disadvantages. When such complex\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses. The P/CF ratio is helpful for arriving at a less\ndistorted view of such a company’s value.\nWhile these various metrics are important, a financial analyst must always consider that companies often\noperate under their own unique sets of circumstances that ultimately will influence many of these equity\nmultiples.\nEnterprise Value (EV) Multiples\nThe following are some common EV multiples used in valuation analyses:\nGordon growth model is as follows\n11.1 • Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\n323\nEV multiples take an increasingly important role when value decisions surround recent mergers and\nacquisitions. Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their",

This is also an unrealistic\nassumption that can present problems when attempting to evaluate companies such as Amazon, Facebook,\nGoogle, or other organizations that do not pay dividends. Constant growth models are most often used to\nvalue mature companies whose dividend payments have steadily increased over a significant period of time.\nWhen applied, the constant growth DDM will generate the present value of an infinite stream of dividends that\nare growing at a constant rate.\nThe constant growth DDM formula is\nwhere D0 is the value of the dividend received this year, D1 is the value of the dividend to be received next\nyear, g is the growth rate of the dividend, and r is the required rate of return.\nAs can be seen above, after simplification, the constant growth DDM formula becomes the Gordon growth\nmodel formula and works in the same way. Let’s look at some examples.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nConstant Growth DDM: Example 1\nIf a stock is paying a dividend of $5.00 this year and the dividend has been steadily growing at 4% annually,\nwhat is the intrinsic value of the stock, assuming an investor’s required rate of return of 8%?\nSolution:\nApply the constant growth DDM formula:\nSimplify to the Gordon growth model:\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n327\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nConstant Growth DDM: Example 2\nIf a stock is selling at $250 with a current dividend of $10, what would be the dividend growth rate of this\nstock, assuming a required rate of return of 12%?\nSolution:\nApply the constant growth DDM formula:\nSimplify and continue the calculation:\nSo, the growth rate is 7.69%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDividend Discount Model: A Complete Animated Guide\nIn this video for the Investing for Beginners course and podcast, Andrew Sather introduces the DDM,\n(https://openstax.org/r/Andrew_Sather_introduces_the_DDM) demonstrating both the constant growth\nDDM (Gordon growth model) and the two-stage DDM.\nVariable or Nonconstant Growth Dividend Discount Model\nMany experienced analysts prefer to use the variable (nonconstant) growth DDM because it is a much closer\napproximation of businesses’ actual dividend payment policies, making it much closer to reality than other\nforms of DDM. The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward. What is the present value of the stock if\nthe required rate of return is 8%?

Many analysts like to use the\ntwo-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable\nassumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level\nof, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will\nmaintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of\ndividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.\nAs we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:\n•",

To answer our questions, we will look at two forms of\nefficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency.\nOperational Efficiency\nOperational efficiency concerns the speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available\nprice. Through the years, the competitive nature of the market has promoted operational efficiency.\nIn the past, the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) used a designated-order turnaround computer system\nknown as SuperDOT to manage orders. SuperDOT was designed to match buyers and sellers and execute\ntrades with confirmation to both parties in a matter of seconds, giving both buyers and sellers the best\n11.5 • Efficient Markets\n345\navailable prices. SuperDOT was replaced by a system known as the Super Display Book (SDBK) in 2009 and\nsubsequently replaced by the Universal Trading Platform in 2012.\nNASDAQ used a process referred to as the small-order execution system (SOES) to process orders. The\npractice for registered dealers had been for SOES to publicly display all limit orders (orders awaiting execution\nat specified price), the best dealer quotes, and the best customer limit order sizes. The SOES system has now\nbeen largely phased out with the emergence of all-electronic trading that increased transaction speed at ever\nhigher trading volumes.\nPublic access to the best available prices promotes operational efficiency. This speed in matching buyers and\nsellers at the best available price is strong evidence that the stock markets are operationally efficient.\nInformational Efficiency\nA second measure of efficiency is informational efficiency, or how quickly a source reflects comprehensive\ninformation in the available trading prices. A price is efficient if the market has used all available information\nto set it, which implies that stocks always trade at their fair value (see Figure 11.12). If an investor does not\nreceive the most current information, the prices are “stale”; therefore, they are at a trading disadvantage.\nFigure 11.12 Forms of Market Efficiency A market is efficient if it provides all information that is available.\nForms of Market Efficiency\nFinancial economists have devised three forms of market efficiency from an information perspective: weak\nform, semi-strong form, and strong form. These three forms constitute the efficient market hypothesis.\nBelievers in these three forms of efficient markets maintain, in varying degrees, that it is pointless to search\nfor undervalued stocks, sell stocks at inflated prices, or predict market trends.\nIn weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock’s price history and trading volume. It is useless\nto chart historical stock prices to predict future stock prices such that you can identify mispriced stocks and\nroutinely outperform the market. In other words, technical analysis cannot beat the market. The market itself\nis the best technical analyst out there.\n346\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n11.1 Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\nThis section introduced common stock and some of the models and calculation methods used by investors\nand financial analysts to determine the prices or values of common shares. The most evaluative ratios that can\nbe computed from a company’s financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to book (P/B),\nprice-to-sales (P/S), and price-to cash-flow (P/CF) ratios.\n11.2 Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\nThe dividend discount model, or DDM, is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is\nthe present value of all of its future dividends. The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\n11.4 Preferred Stock",

T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\n354\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-\nexempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid\nsecurities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable. MMMFs provide smaller firms and investors the\nopportunity to participate in the money market by facilitating smaller individual investment amounts.\nFinancial Instrument Typical Maturity Minimum Amount\nIssuer\nTreasury bills\n4–52 weeks\n$10,000\nFederal government\nCommercial paper\n270 days\n$100,000\nBusinesses\nNegotiable CDs\n6 months\n$100,000\nFinancial institutions\nMMMFs\nInvestment companies\nFederal funds\n1 day\n$1 million\nFinancial institutions\nTable 12.1 Money Market Instrument Characteristics (Selected)\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets the equilibrium interest rate\non federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools.

Because there is no formal exchange present, it is possible that investors will have trouble finding\nbuyers or sellers for their stocks.\nMost of the trading consists of used or previously issued stocks in over-the-counter markets and organized\nexchanges. The two largest stock exchanges in the world, as measured by the market capitalization of the\ncompanies listed on the exchange, are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Both exchanges\nare located in the United States. Other large stock exchanges are located in Japan, China, Hong Kong,\ncontinental Europe, London, and Saudi Arabia.\nProcess of Offering Equities\nThe primary market is the market for new securities, and the secondary market is the market for used\nsecurities. When issuing new equity, the issuing firm receives the proceeds of the sale. Having an active\nsecondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired.\nMost of the trading of equity securities is for used securities on the secondary market.\nAn initial public offering, or IPO, occurs when a firm offers stock to the public for the first time. With a typical\nIPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The\ninvestment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue,\nand establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see\nFigure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of\nthe value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum\ncompany, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.8 The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at\nover $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese\ngovernment.9\nInstitutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Smaller investors\nrarely have the opportunity to purchase. However, any investor can buy the new shares once available for\npublic trading. Investment author and financial expert Professor Burton Malkiel cautions that buying IPOs\nimmediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs\nhave underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.10\nAnother way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through a seasoned equity offering\n(SEO). An IPO occurs when a firm transitions from a private to a public company. An SEO takes place when a\ncorporation that is already publicly traded issues additional shares of stock to the public. An SEO is often part\nof a SEC Rule 415 offering, or so-called shelf registration. Shelf registrations allow a company to register with\nthe SEC to issue new shares but wait up to two years before issuing the shares. This gives companies the\nability to register their intent to issue new shares and to “set them on the shelf” until market conditions are\nmost favorable for issuance to the public.\n8\nJennifer Rudden. “Largest IPOs Worldwide as of January 21, 2021.” Statista. 2021. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269343/\nworlds-largest-ipos/\n9\nDeborah D’Souza. “Ant Group Set to Be World’s Largest IPO Ever.” Investopedia.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public.

Baseball\npundit Sam Ewing noted, “Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten-dollar haircut you used to get\nfor five dollars when you had hair.”15 If what you have earned on your investments fails to keep up with\nchanging prices, you may have a larger portfolio with less purchasing power.\nExpected versus Actual Inflation\nInflation occurs when things cost more and your money buys less today than it did yesterday.

Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase.

Retired people may spend a greater portion\nof their income on healthcare than someone in their twenties.17 Residents on the East and West Coasts spend\na higher percentage of their earnings on housing than those living in the Midwest.18 As such, there are several\ndifferent measures of inflation based on geographic region or other factors.19 It is worth noting that a basket\nof goods and services that cost $100 in 1984 would cost approximately $260 by the end of 2020, an increase of\n160% (see Figure 12.6)! Over that same period, the average annual rate of inflation as measured by the CPI\nwas 2.55%.

Both indices\ntrack the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation. A lower standard deviation of returns suggests less uncertainty of\nreturns and therefore less risk.\nCapital market history demonstrates that the average return to stocks has significantly outperformed other\nfinancial security classes, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or the money market. Table 12.4\nprovides the return and standard deviation of several US investment classes over the 40-year period\n1981–2020. As you can see, stocks outperformed bonds, bills, and inflation.

Note that the value of the\nlarge company portfolio is more than 50 times greater than the equal investment in long-term US government\nbonds. This supports the importance of thoughtful asset allocation.\nStill, the size of a firm has a significant impact on how investors choose equity securities. Capital market\nhistory also shows that a portfolio of small company stocks has realized larger average annual returns, as well\nas greater variability, than a portfolio of large companies as represented by the S&P 500. Small-cap stock total\nreturns ranged from a high of 142.9% in 1933 to a low of -58.0% in 1937.\nMore recently, the differential return between small and large capital stocks has not been as pronounced.\nFrom 1980 through 2020, the Wilshire US Small-Cap Index has averaged an annual compound return of 12.13%\ncompared to the Wilshire US Large Cap Index average of 11.82% over the same period.

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks",

Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by\nmathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\nfor arithmetic mean.\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\nthen divide by the number of data values.\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data. Population\ndata represents all the outcomes or measurements that are of interest. Sample data represents outcomes or\nmeasurements collected from a subset, or part, of the population of interest.\nThe notation\nis used to indicate the sample mean, where the arithmetic mean is calculated based on data\ntaken from a sample. The notation\nis used to denote the sum of the data values, and\nis used to indicate\nthe number of data values in the sample, also known as the sample size.\nThe sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:\nFinance professionals often rely on averages of Treasury bill auction amounts to determine their value. Table\n13.1 lists the Treasury bill auction amounts for a sample of auctions from December 2020.\nMaturity\nAmount ($Billions)\n4-week T-bills\n$32.9\n8-week T-bills\n38.4\n13-week T-bills\n63.1\n26-week T-bills\n59.6\n52-week T-bills\n39.7\nTotal\n$233.7\nTable 13.1 United States Treasury Bill\nAuctions, December 22 and 24, 2020\n(source: Treasury Direct)\n382\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean of the amount paid for Treasury bills at auction, in billions of dollars, we use\nthe following formula:\nMedian\nTo determine the median of a data set, order the data from smallest to largest, and then find the middle value\nin the ordered data set. For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\nSolution:\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\n$5,000,000.\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\nset.\n13.1 • Measures of Center\n383\nMode\nAnother measure of center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one\nmode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data\nset with two modes is called bimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology\nstock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:\nTo find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this\ndata set is 72. It is helpful to know that the most common closing price of this particular stock over the past 20\nweeks has been $72.00.\nGeometric Mean",

In some data sets, the data values are\nconcentrated close to the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out. For example,\nan investor might examine the yearly returns for Stock A, which are 1%, 2%, -1%, 0%, and 3%, and compare\nthem to the yearly returns for Stock B, which are -9%, 2%, 15%, -5%, and 0%.\nNotice that Stock B exhibits more volatility in yearly returns than Stock A. The investor may want to quantify\nthis variation in order to make the best investment decisions for a particular investment objective.\nThe most common measure of variation, or spread, is standard deviation. The standard deviation of a data\nset is a measure of how far the data values are from their mean. A standard deviation\n•\nprovides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set; and\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n385\n•\ncan be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.\nThe standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set. The standard deviation is\nalways positive or zero. It is small when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little\nvariation or spread. It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\nvariation.\nSuppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The average stock\nprice for both stocks is $5. For Stock A, the standard deviation of the stock price is 2, whereas the standard\ndeviation for Stock B is 4. Because Stock B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more\nvariation in the stock price for Stock B than in the price for Stock A.\nThere are two different formulas for calculating standard deviation. Which formula to use depends on whether\nthe data represents a sample or a population. The notation s is used to represent the sample standard\ndeviation, and the notation\nis used to represent the population standard deviation. In the formulas shown\nbelow, x̄ is the sample mean,\nis the population mean, n is the sample size, and N is the population size.\nFormula for the sample standard deviation:\nFormula for the population standard deviation:\nVariance\nVariance also provides a measure of the spread of data values. The variance of a data set measures the extent\nto which each data value differs from the mean. The more the individual data values differ from the mean, the\nlarger the variance. Both the standard deviation and the variance provide similar information.\nIn a finance application, variance can be used to determine the volatility of an investment and therefore to\nhelp guide financial decisions. For example, a more cautious investor might opt for investments with low\nvolatility.\nSimilar to standard deviation, the formula used to calculate variance also depends on whether the data is\ncollected from a sample or a population. The notation\nis used to represent the sample variance, and the\nnotation σ2 is used to represent the population variance.\nFormula for the sample variance:\nFormula for the population variance:\nThis is the method to calculate standard deviation and variance for a sample:\n1.\nFirst, find the mean\nof the data set by adding the data values and dividing the sum by the number of\ndata values.\n2.\nSet up a table with three columns, and in the first column, list the data values in the data set.\n3.\nFor each row, subtract the mean from the data value\n, and enter the difference in the second\n386\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncolumn.

For example, if you\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.",

For example, we might be\ninterested in the spread, center, and shape of the data set’s distribution. When a data set has many data\nvalues, it can be difficult to see patterns and come to conclusions about important characteristics of the data.\nA frequency distribution allows us to organize and tabulate the data in a summarized way and also to create\ngraphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set.\nTo create a basic frequency distribution, set up a table with three columns. The first column will show the\nintervals for the data, and the second column will show the frequency of the data values, or the count of how\n392\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmany data values fall within each interval. A third column can be added to include the relative frequency for\neach row, which is calculated by taking the frequency for that row and dividing it by the sum of all the\nfrequencies in the table.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nGraphing Demand and Supply\nA financial consultant at a brokerage firm records the portfolio values for 20 clients, as shown in Table 13.5,\nwhere the portfolio values are shown in thousands of dollars.\n278\n318\n422\n577\n618\n735\n798\n864\n903\n944\n1,052 1,099 1,132 1,180 1,279\n1,365 1,471 1,572 1,787 1,905\nTable 13.5 Portfolio Values for 20\nClients at a Brokerage Firm\n($000s)\nCreate a frequency distribution table using the following intervals for the portfolio values:\nSolution:\nCreate a table where the intervals for portfolio value are listed in the first column. For this example, it was\ndecided to create a frequency distribution table with seven rows and a class width set to 300. The class\nwidth is the distance from the start of one interval to the start of the next interval in the subsequent row.\nFor example, the interval for the second row starts at 300, the interval for the third row starts at 600, and so\non.\nIn the second column, record the frequency, or the number of data values that fall within the interval, for\neach row. For example, for the first row, count the number of data values that fall between 0 and 299.\nBecause there is only one data value (278) that falls in this interval, the corresponding frequency is 1. For\nthe second row, there are 3 data values that fall between 300 and 599 (318, 422, and 577). Thus, the\nfrequency for the second row is 3.\nFor the third column, called relative frequency, take the frequency for each row and divide it by the sum of\nthe frequencies, which is 20. For example, in the first row, the relative frequency will be 1 divided by 20,\nwhich is 0.05. The relative frequency for the second row will be 3 divided by 20, which is 0.15. The resulting\nfrequency distribution table is shown in Table 13.6.\n0–299\n300–599\n600–899\n900–1,199\n1,200–1,499\n1,500–1,799\n1,800–2,099\n13.4 • Statistical Distributions\n393\nPortfolio Value Interval ($000s) Frequency Relative Frequency\n0–299\n1\n0.05\n300–599\n3\n0.15\n600–899\n4\n0.20\n900–1,199\n6\n0.30\n1,200–1,499\n3\n0.15\n1,500–1,799\n2\n0.10\n1,800–2,099\n1\n0.05\nTable 13.6 Frequency Distribution of Portfolio Values for 20 Clients at a\nBrokerage Firm ($000s)\nThe frequency table indicates that most customers have portfolio values between $300,000 and $599,000, as\nthis row in the table shows the highest frequency. Very few customers have portfolios with a value below\n$299,000 or above $1,800,000, as these frequencies in these rows are very low. Because the highest\nfrequency corresponds to the row in the middle of the table and the frequencies decrease with each\ninterval below and above this middle interval, the frequency table indicates that this distribution is a bell-\nshaped distribution.\nThe following is a summary of how to create a frequency distribution table (for integer data). Note that the\nnumber of classes in a frequency table is the same as the number of rows in the table.\n1.\nCalculate the class width using the formula\n◦\nNote: For integer data, round the class width up to the next whole number.\n2.\nCreate a table with a number of rows equal to the number of classes.

Add the class width to each new lower class limit to calculate the lower class limit for each\nsubsequent row.\n5.\nThe upper class limit for each row is 1 less than the lower class limit of the subsequent row.

It is available as a free program and\nprovides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical programming. R is\nincreasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical tool as it is an open-source language and additional\nfeatures are constantly being added by the user community. The tool can be used on many different\ncomputing platforms and can be downloaded at the R Project website (https://openstax.org/r/the-R-project-\nwebsite).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUsing the R Statistical Tool\nThere are many resources for learning and using the R statistical tool, including the following:\nHow to install R on different computer operating systems (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-install)\nIntroduction to using R (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-using-R)\nHow to import and export data using R (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-import-and-export)\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) on using R (https://openstax.org/r/frequently-asked-questions)\nOnce you have installed and started R on your computer, at the bottom of the R console, you should see the\nsymbol >, which indicates that R is ready to accept commands.\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or 'help.start()' for an HTML\nbrowser interface to help. Type 'q()' to quit R.\n>\nR is a command-driven language, meaning that the user enters commands at the prompt, which R then\nexecutes one at a time. R can also execute a program containing multiple commands. There are ways to add a\ngraphic user interface (GUI) to R. An example of a GUI tool for R is RStudio (https://openstax.org/r/RStudio).\nThe R command line can be used to perform any numeric calculation, similar to a handheld calculator.

For statistical analysis, there are many preestablished\nfunctions in R to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and so on. Variables can be named and\nassigned values using the assignment operator <-. For example, the following R commands assign the value of\n20 to the variable named x and assign the value of 30 to the variable named y:\n> x <- 20\n> y <- 30\nThese variable names can be used in any calculation, such as multiplying x by y to produce the result 600:\n> x*y\n[1] 600\nThe typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector. The following R command will generate a vector called salaries that contains the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nThis vector salaries can then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as\nshown:\n> mean(salaries)\n[1] 64250\n> median(salaries)\n[1] 62500\n> min(salaries)\n[1] 40000\n> max(salaries)\n[1] 92000\n13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool\n407\nAnother option for generating a vector in R is to use the seq function, which will automatically generate a\nsequence of numbers. For example, we can generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, incremented by 0.5,\nand call this vector example1, as follows:\n> example1 <- seq(1, 5, by=0.5)\nIf we then type the name of the vector and hit enter, R will provide a listing of numeric values for that vector\nname.\n> salaries\n[1] 40000 50000 75000 92000\n> example1\n[1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\nOften, we are interested in generating a quick statistical summary of a data set in the form of its mean,",

For example, we may be interested\nto know if there is a correlation between bond prices and interest rates or between the age of a car and the\nvalue of the car. To investigate the correlation between two numeric quantities, the first step is to create a\nscatter plot that will graph the (x, y) ordered pairs. The independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the\nx-variable, and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as the y-variable.\nFor example, we may be interested to know if the price of Nike stock is correlated with the value of the S&P 500\n(Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index). To investigate this, monthly data can be collected for Nike stock\nprices and value of the S&P 500 for a period of time, and a scatter plot can be created and examined. A scatter\nplot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two variables. The\nsetup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted\non the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted\non the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter\ndiagram. Table 14.1 shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year\ntime period.\nTo assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine\nif a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a\nnegative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent\nvariable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to\ndecrease (the two quantities move in the same direction). A negative correlation indicates that as the\nindependent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases, or, as the independent variable decreases,\nthe dependent variable increases (the two quantities move in opposite directions). If there is no relationship or\nassociation between the two quantities, where one quantity changing does not affect the other quantity, we\nconclude that there is no correlation between the two variables.\nDate\nS&P 500\nNike\nStock Price\n4/1/2020 2,912.43\n87.18\n5/1/2020 3,044.31\n98.58\n6/1/2020 3,100.29\n98.05\nTable 14.1 Nike Stock Price ($) and\nValue of S&P 500 over a One-Year\nTime Period (source: Yahoo!

A more precise assessment of the correlation between the two quantities can be obtained by\ncalculating the numeric correlation coefficient (referred to using the symbol r).\nThe correlation coefficient, which was developed by statistician Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is a measure\nof the strength and direction of the correlation between the independent variable x and the dependent\nvariable y.\nThe formula for r is shown below; however, technology, such as Excel or the statistical analysis program R, is\ntypically used to calculate the correlation coefficient.\n14.1 • Correlation Analysis\n419\nwhere n refers to the number of data pairs and the symbol\nindicates to sum the x-values.\nTable 14.2 provides a step-by-step procedure on how to calculate the correlation coefficient r.\nStep\nRepresentation in Symbols\n1.

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval. The second case, where we\nare asking for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variable y of a single experiment using a value of x,\nis called the prediction interval.\nThe prediction interval for an individual y for\ncan be calculated as\nwhere se is the standard deviation of the error term, sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable, and\nis\nthe critical value of the t-distribution at the\nconfidence level.\nTabulated values of the t-distribution are available in online references such as the Engineering Statistics\nHandbook (https://openstax.org/r/engineering_handbook). The mathematical computations for prediction\nintervals are complex, and usually the calculations are performed using software. The formula above can be\nimplemented in Excel to create a 95% prediction interval for the forecast for monthly revenue when\nis spent on monthly advertising. Figure 14.10 shows the detailed calculations in Excel to arrive at a\n95% prediction interval of (13,270.95, 15,370.09) for the monthly revenue. (The commands refer to the Excel\ndata table shown in Figure 14.9.)\n436\n14 • Regression Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 14.10 Calculations for 95% Prediction Interval for Monthly Revenue\nThis prediction interval can be interpreted as follows: there is 95% confidence that when the amount spent on\nmonthly advertising is $80,000, the corresponding monthly revenue will be between $13,270.95 and\n$15,370.09.\nVarious computer regression software packages provide programs within the regression functions to provide\nanswers to inquiries of estimated predicted values of y given various values chosen for the x-variable(s). For\nexample, the statistical program R provides these prediction intervals directly. It is important to know just\nwhich interval is being tested in the computer package because the difference in the size of the standard\ndeviations will change the size of the interval estimated. This is shown in Figure 14.11.\nFigure 14.11 Prediction and Confidence Intervals for Regression Equation at 95% Confidence Level\nFigure 14.11 shows visually the difference the standard deviation makes in the size of the estimated intervals.\nThe confidence interval, measuring the expected value of the dependent variable, is smaller than the\nprediction interval for the same level of confidence. The expected value method assumes that the experiment\nis conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method. The logic here is similar, although\nnot identical, to that discussed when developing the relationship between the sample size and the confidence\ninterval using the central limit theorem. There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation.

Choosing values of x beyond the range of the data used to estimate the equation\nposes an even greater danger of creating estimates with little use, very large intervals, and risk of error. Figure\n14.12 shows this relationship.\nFigure 14.12 Confidence Interval for an Individual Value of x,\n, at 95% Confidence Level\nFigure 14.12 demonstrates the concern for the quality of the estimated interval, whether it is a prediction\ninterval or a confidence interval. As the value chosen to predict y,\nin the graph, is further from the central\nweight of the data,\n, we see the interval expand in width even while holding constant the level of confidence.\nThis shows that the precision of any estimate will diminish as one tries to predict beyond the largest weight of\nthe data and most certainly will degrade rapidly for predictions beyond the range of the data. Unfortunately,\nthis is just where most predictions are desired. They can be made, but the width of the confidence interval may\nbe so large as to render the prediction useless.\n14.6\nUse of R Statistical Analysis Tool for Regression Analysis\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate correlation coefficients using the R statistical tool.\n•\nGenerate linear regression models using the R statistical tool.\nGenerate Correlation Coefficients Using the R Statistical Tool\nR is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry. R is available as a free\nprogram and provides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical\nprogramming. R provides many functions and capabilities for regression analysis.\nRecall that most calculations in R are handled via functions.\nThe typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector.

This uncertainty about what the return will\nbe is referred to as risk.\nWe begin by looking at how to measure both risk and return when considering an individual asset, such as one\nstock. If your grandparents bought 100 shares of Apple, Inc. stock for you when you were born, you are\ninterested in knowing how well that investment has done. You may even want to compare how that\ninvestment has fared to how an investment in a different stock, perhaps Disney, would have done. You are\ninterested in measuring the historical return.\nIndividual Investment Realized Return\nThe realized return of an investment is the total return that occurs over a particular time period. Suppose that\nyou purchased a share of Target (TGT) at the beginning of January 2020 for $128.74. At the end of the year, you\nsold the stock for $176.53, which was $47.79 more than you paid for it. This increase in value is known as a\ncapital gain. As the owner of the stock, you also received $2.68 in dividends during 2020. The total dollar return\nfrom your investment is calculated as\nIt is common to express investment returns in percentage terms rather than dollar terms. This allows you to\nanswer the question “How much do I receive for each dollar invested?” so that you can compare investments\nof different sizes. The total percent return from your investment is\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the dividends you received by the initial stock price. This\ncalculation says that for each dollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.0208 in dividends. The capital\ngain yield is the change in the stock price divided by the initial stock price. This calculation says that for each\ndollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.3712 in capital gains. Your total percent return of 39.20% means\nthat you made $0.392 for every dollar invested when your gains from both dividends and stock price\nappreciation are totaled together.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Return\nYou purchased 10 shares of 3M (MMM) stock in January 2020 for $175 per share, received dividends of $5.91\n450\n15 • How to Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nper share, and sold the stock at the end of the year for $169.72 per share.

Your\ncapital gain is negative, or what is often referred to as a capital loss. Although the price fell, you still had a\npositive total dollar return because of the dividend income.\nOf course, investors seldom purchase a stock and then sell it exactly one year later. Assume that you\npurchased shares of Facebook (FB) on June 1, 2020, for $228.50 per share and sold the shares three months\nlater for $261.90. You received no dividends. In this case, your holding period percentage return is calculated\nas\nThis 14.62% is your return for a three-month holding period. To compare them to other investment\nopportunities, you need to express returns on a per-year, or annualized, basis. The holding period returned is\nconverted to an effective annual rate (EAR) using the formula\nwhere m is the number of holding periods in a year.\nThere are four three-month periods in a year. So, the EAR for this investment is\nWhat happens if you own a stock for more than one year? Your holding period return would have occurred\nover a period longer than a year, but the process to calculate the EAR is the same.

In\nother words, the return for the stock is highly unpredictable. Although the return for CVS varies from year to\nyear, it is not subject to the wide swings of the returns for DAL or LUV.\nWhy are stock returns so volatile?

Finance)\nAs investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has\ngood years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just\nlike DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the\nsame for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return\nfor XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive\nreturn. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,\nwashing away some of the volatility.\nWhen an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.\nWhen two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the\nvolatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How\ncorrelated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.\nYou will recall from our study of correlation in Regression Analysis in Finance that a correlation coefficient\ndescribes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a\nperfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two\nvariables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more\n15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\n459\nstrongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated\nin a portfolio decreases risk.\nNotice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard\ndeviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less\nthan one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed\nto many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two\nstocks provides only a small decrease in risk.\nThis is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy\nis strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.\nWhen something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both\ncompanies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is\nspecific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure\nto the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience\npositive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.\nOn the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation\nthan those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM\nis likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the\nstandard deviation of the portfolio more.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHow to Build a Diversified Portfolio\nTV personality, former hedge fund manager, and author Jim Cramer encourages investors to build a\ndiversified portfolio, having no more than 20% of a portfolio in one sector.3 Watch this CNBC video\n(https://openstax.org/r/CNBC_video) to learn more about how he suggests investors can build a diversified\nportfolio by purchasing five to 10 stocks.\nPortfolio Size and Risk\nAs you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases.

Geopolitical events, major storms, and pandemics can also impact the\nentire market. Investors in stocks cannot avoid this type of risk. This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that\ninvestors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.\nIn addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,4 the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as\nthe number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration in this\nsubsequent article by Statman (https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman) for context). Increasing the size\nof the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio\nincreases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How\nmany stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all\nfinancial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification\nthan a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients. A portfolio that consists of American Airlines,\nSpirit Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Jet Blue, along with a few other stocks, is\nnot very diversified because of the heavy concentration in the airline industry.

The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the\nportfolio returns can also be calculated easily. By comparing the returns of a stock with the returns of the\noverall market using Excel charting tools, the beta for a stock, which measures systematic risk, can be\ndetermined.\nKey Terms\narithmetic average return\nthe sum of an asset’s annual returns over a number of years divided by the\nnumber of years\nbeta\na measure of how a stock moves relative to the market\ncapital asset pricing model (CAPM)\nthe expected return of a security, equal to the risk-free rate plus a\npremium for the amount of risk taken\ncapital gain yield\nthe difference between the price a stock is sold for and the price that was originally paid\nfor it divided by the price originally paid\ndiversification\nholding a variety of assets in a portfolio\ndividend yield\nthe total dividends received by the owner of a share of stock divided by the price originally\npaid for the stock\neffective annual rate (EAR)\nreturns expressed on an annualized or yearly basis; allows for the comparison\nof various investments\nfirm-specific risk\nthe risk that an event may impact the expected revenue or costs of a firm, thereby\n472\n15 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nimpacting the returns to investors; also known as diversifiable risk\ngeometric average return\nthe compound annual return derived from the effective annual rate and time\nvalue of money formulas\nholding period percentage return\nthe gain received from holding a stock, calculated by adding the amount\nreceived when the stock is sold to any dividends earned while holding the stock, subtracting the price\noriginally paid for the stock, then dividing the difference by the price originally paid\nJensen’s alpha",

            "chunk": "rule of not adding or comparing cash flows that occur in different time periods.\nA second disadvantage of using the payback period method is that there is not a clearly defined acceptance or\nrejection criterion. When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length of time in which a\nproject must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods\nthan the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s were to set a payback period of four\nyears, Project A would be accepted, but Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and so would\nbe rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years would be arbitrary; it is not grounded in any\nfinancial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of three, four, five, or\nany other number of years as its criterion for accepting projects.\nA third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all\nhave payback periods of five years. However, Projects B and C end after year 5, while Project D has a large cash\nflow that occurs in year 6, which is excluded from the analysis. The payback method is shortsighted in that it\nfavors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash\nflows after the arbitrary payback time criterion.\nFourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful the planning and analysis,\na business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier than others, with less\ncertain cash flows, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash\nflows.\n16.1 • Payback Period Method\n481\n16.2\nNet Present Value (NPV) Method\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine net present value.\n•\nCalculate net present value.\n•\nList the advantages and disadvantages of using the net present value method.\n•\nGraph an NPV profile.\nNet Present Value (NPV) Calculation\nSam’s purchasing of the embroidery machine involves spending money today in the hopes of making more\nmoney in the future. Because the cash inflows and outflows occur in different time periods, they cannot be\ndirectly compared to each other. Instead, they must be translated into a common time period using time value\nof money techniques. By converting all of the cash flows that will occur from a project into present value, or\ncurrent dollars, the cash inflows from the project can be compared to the cash outflows. If the cash inflows\nexceed the cash outflows in present value terms, the project will add value and should be accepted. The\ndifference between the present value of the cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows is known as\nnet present value (NPV).\nThe equation for NPV can be written as\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision of whether to purchase the embroidery machine. If we assume that\nafter six years the embroidery machine will be obsolete and the project will end, when placed on a timeline,\nthe project’s expected cash flow is shown in Table 16.3:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($) (16,000) 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000\nTable 16.3\nCalculating NPV is simply a time value of money problem in which each cash flow is discounted back to the\npresent value.

The value of the\nfirm will increase by $2,835.63 as a result of accepting the project.\nCalculating NPV involves computing the present value of each cash flow and then summing the present values\nof all cash flows from the project. This project has six future cash flows, so six present values must be\ncomputed. Although this is not difficult, it is tedious.\nA financial calculator is able to calculate a series of present values in the background for you, automating\nmuch of the process. You simply have to provide the calculator with each cash flow, the time period in which\neach cash flow occurs, and the discount rate that you want to use to discount the future cash flows to the\npresent.\nFollow the steps in Table 16.4 for calculating NPV:\n482\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSelect cash flow worksheet\nCF\nCF\nCF0\nXXXX\n2\nClear the cash flow worksheet\n2ND\n2ND [CLR WORK] CF0\n0\n3\nEnter initial cash flow\n16000 +/-\n+/- ENTER\nENTER CF0 = -16,000.00\n4\nEnter cash flow for the first year\n↓\n2000 ENTER\nENTER\nC01 =\n2,000.00\n↓\nF01 =\n1.0\n5\nEnter cash flow for the second year ↓\n4000 ENTER\nENTER\nC02 =\n4,000.00\n↓\nF02 =\n1.0\n6\nEnter cash flow for the third year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC03 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF03 =\n1.0\n7\nEnter cash flow for the fourth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC04 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF04 =\n1.0\n8\nEnter cash flow for the fifth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC05 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF05 =\n1.0\n9\nEnter cash flow for the sixth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC06 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF06 =\n1.0\n10\nSelect NPV\nNPV\nNPV\nI\n0.00\n11",

First, the NPV\nmethod uses the time value of money concept. All of the cash flows are discounted back to their present value\nto be compared. Second, the NPV method provides a clear decision criterion. Projects with a positive NPV\nshould be accepted, and projects with a negative NPV should be rejected. Third, the discount rate used to\ndiscount future cash flows to the present can be increased or decreased to adjust for the riskiness of the\nproject’s cash flows.\nDisadvantages\nThe NPV method can be difficult for someone without a finance background to understand. Also, the NPV\nmethod can be problematic when available capital resources are limited. The NPV method provides a criterion\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n16.2 • Net Present Value (NPV) Method\n483\nfor whether or not a project is a good project.

Issues that occur when comparing projects of different\nscales are covered later in this chapter.\n16.4\nAlternative Methods\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate profitability index.\n•\nCalculate discounted payback period.\n•\nCalculate modified internal rate of return.\nProfitability Index (PI)\nThe profitability index (PI) uses the same inputs as the NPV calculation, but it converts the results to a ratio.\nThe numerator is the present value of the benefits of doing a project. The denominator is the present value of\n488\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe cost of doing the project. The formula for calculating PI is\nFor the embroidery machine project that Sam’s Sporting Goods is considering, the PI would be calculated as\nThe numerator of the PI formula is the benefit of the project, and the denominator is the cost of the project.\nThus, the PI is the benefit relative to the cost. When NPV is greater than zero, PI will be greater than 1. When\nNPV is less than zero, PI will be less than 1. Therefore, the decision criterion using the PI method is to accept a\nproject if the PI is greater than 1 and reject a project if the PI is less than 1.\nNote that the NPV method and the PI method of project evaluation will always provide the same answer to the\naccept-or-reject question. The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from\nbest to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.\nDiscounted Payback Period\nThe payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the\nfact that it ignores the time value of money. The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\ndetermine the payback period.\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback\nperiod does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00)\n2,000.00\n4,000.00\n5,000.00\n5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\nDiscounted Cash Flow ($)\n(16,000)\n1,834.86\n3,366.72\n3,860.92\n3,542.13 3,249.66 2,981.34\nCumulative Discounted\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00) (14,165.14) (10,798.42) (6,937.50) (3,395.37) (145.72) 2,835.62\nTable 16.9\nWhen the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.\nThe discounted payback period would be\nyears. This adjusted calculation addresses the\npayback period method’s flaw of not considering the time value of money, but managers are still confronted\nwith the other disadvantages. No objective criterion for acceptance or rejection exists because of the lack of a\ntheoretical underpinning for what is an acceptable payback period length. The discounted payback period\nignores any cash flows after breakeven occurs; this is a serious drawback, especially when comparing mutually\nexclusive projects.\nModified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)\nFinancial analysts have developed an alternative evaluation technique that is similar to the IRR but modified in\nan attempt to address some of the weakness of the IRR method. This modified internal rate of return\n(MIRR) is calculated using the following steps:\n1.\nFind the present value of all of the cash outflows using the firm’s cost of attracting capital as the discount\n16.4 • Alternative Methods\n489\nrate.\n2.\nFind the future value of all cash inflows using the firm’s cost of attracting capital as the discount rate. All\ncash inflows are compounded to the point in time at which the last cash inflow will be received. The sum of\nthe future value of cash inflows is known as the project terminal value.\n3.\nCompute the yield that sets the future value of the inflows equal to the present value of the outflows. This\nyield is the modified internal rate of return.\nFor our embroidery machine project, the MIRR would be calculated as shown in Table 16.10:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($) (16,000.00) 2,000.00 4,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\n5,000.00\n5,000.00\n3,077.25\n5,646.33\n6,475.15\n5,940.50\n5,450.00\nTerminal Value $31,595.22\nTable 16.10\n1.\nThe only cash outflow is the $16,000 at time period 0.\n2.",

Olympic host cities receive direct revenues from broadcast rights, ticket sales, and\nlicensing agreements. The cities also expect indirect benefits from increased tourism, including increased\nemployment and higher tax revenues. These benefits come after the city makes a major investment in\ninfrastructure, spending money on stadiums, housing, and transportation. The investment in infrastructure\nfor the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was over $50 billion.2 Why do you think the infrastructure\ninvestment for these games was so much higher than the amount spent by cities hosting previous games?\nIf your city were discussing the possibility of bidding to be an Olympic host city, what would you suggest it\nconsider when evaluating the opportunity? Check out this article (https://openstax.org/r/this-article) for\nmore information.\nChoosing between Projects with Different Lives\nSuppose you are considering starting an ice-cream truck business. You find that you can purchase a used truck\nfor $50,000. You estimate that the truck will last for three years, and you will be able to sell enough ice cream\n2\nDavid Filipov. “Russia Spent $50 Billion on the Sochi Olympics. It Might Actually Have Been Worth It.” Washington Post, November\n15, 2017. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/that-sochi-olympic-boondoggle-russians-say-all-the-investment-is-\npaying-off/2017/11/13/65014bd0-b82c-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html\n16.5 • Choosing between Projects\n491\ntreats to generate a cash inflow of $40,000 during each of those years. Your cost of capital is 10%. The positive\nNPV of $49,474 for the project makes this an acceptable project.\nAnother ice-cream truck is also for sale for $50,000. This truck is smaller and will not be able to hold as many\nfrozen treats. However, the truck is newer, with lower mileage, and you estimate that you can use it for six\nyears. This newer truck will allow you to generate a cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The\nNPV of the newer truck is $80,658.\nBecause both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which\ntruck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its\nhigher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made\nsimply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV\nthan the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.\nThere are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life\nproject concludes, another, similar project will be available.\nReplacement Chain Approach\nWith the replacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal\nthe life of the long-life project. You can purchase the newer, lower-mileage ice-cream truck and run your\nbusiness for six years. To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last\nfor three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for\nthe next three years. In essence, you are comparing a six-year project with two consecutive three-year projects\nso that both options will generate cash inflows for six years. Your timeline for the projects (comparing an\nolder, larger truck with a newer, lower-mileage truck) will look like Table 16.12:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOlder Truck ($)\n($50,000) 40,000 40,000\n40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000\nOlder Truck ($)\n(50,000)\nNewer Truck ($)\n(50,000) 30,000 30,000\n30,000 30,000 30,000 30,000\nTable 16.12\nThe present values of all of the cash inflows and outflows from purchasing two of the older, larger trucks\nconsecutively are added together to find the NPV of that alternative. The NPV of this alternative is $86,645,\nwhich is higher than the NPV of $80,658 of the newer truck, as shown in Table 16.13:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOlder Truck ($)\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\nOlder Truck ($)\n(50,000)\nNet Present Value (50,000) 36,363.64 33,057.85 (7,513.15) 27,320.54 24,836.85 22,578.96\nTable 16.13\nWhen using the replacement chain approach, the short-term project is repeated any number of times to equal\nthe length of the longer-term project.

Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions.\nEspecially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to\nchanges in financing costs. Excel simplifies the creation of an NPV profile.\nMiddleton Manufacturing is considering installing solar panels to heat water and provide lighting throughout\nits plant. To do so will cost the company $800,000 this year. However, this upgrade will save the company an\nestimated $150,000 in electrical costs each year for the next 10 years. Constructing an NPV profile of this\nproject will allow Middleton to see how the NPV of the project changes with the cost of attracting funds.\n16.6 • Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions\n497\nFirst, the project cash flows must be placed in an Excel spreadsheet, as is shown in cells D2 through N2 in\nFigure 16.9. The company’s cost of funds is placed in cell B1; begin by putting in 10% for this rate. Next, the\nformula for NPV is placed in cell B6; cell B6 shows the NPV of the cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using the\nrate that is in cell B1.\nFor reference, compute IRR in cell B4. Calculating IRR is not necessary for creating the NPV profile. However, it\ngives a good reference point. Remember that if the IRR of a project is greater than the firm’s cost of attracting\ncapital, then the NPV will be positive; if the IRR of a project is less than the firm’s cost of attracting capital, then\nthe NPV will be negative.\nAn NPV profile is created by calculating the NPV of the project for a variety of possible costs of attracting\ncapital. In other words, you want to calculate NPV using the project cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using a\nvariety of discount rates in cell B1. This is accomplished by using the Excel data table function. The data table\nfunction shows how the outcome of an Excel formula changes when one of the cells in the spreadsheet\nchanges. In this instance, you want to determine how the value of the NPV formula (cell B6) changes when the\ndiscount rate (cell B1) changes.\nFigure 16.9 Project Cash Flows Inserted into Excel\nTo do this, enter the range of interest rates that you want to consider down a column, beginning in cell A7.\nThis example shows rates from 1% to 20% entered in cells A7 through A26. Your Excel file should now look like\nthe screenshot in Figure 16.9.\nNext, highlight the cells containing the NPV calculation and the range of discount rates. Thus, you will highlight\ncells A6 through A26 and B6 through B26 (see Figure 16.10). Click Data at the top of the Excel menu so that you\nsee the What-If Analysis feature. Choose Data Table. Because the various discount rates you want to use are in\na column, use the “Column input cell” option. Enter “B1” in this box.

This is shown in Figure 16.11.\nFigure 16.11 NPV Calculated for Various Discount Rates\nNow that the various NPVs are calculated, you can create the NPV profile graph. To create the graph, begin by\nhighlighting the discount rates and NPVs that are in cells A7 through A26 and B7 through B26. Next, go to the\nInsert tab in the menu at the top of Excel.

You can customize the chart by renaming it,\nlabeling the axes, and making other cosmetic changes if you like.\nYou will notice that the NPV profile crosses the x-axis between 13% and 14%; remember that the NPV will be\nzero when the discount rate that is used to calculate the NPV is equal to the project’s IRR, which we previously\ncalculated to be 13.43%. If the firm’s cost of raising funds is lower than 13.43%, the NPV profile shows that the\nproject has a positive NPV, and the project should be accepted.

Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be\nused. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return\nhas been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from\nwhat it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk\npremiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n513\nThe same issue with how much historical data should be considered arises when calculating a company’s beta.\nDifferent financial managers can calculate significantly different betas even for well-established, stable\ncompanies. In April 2021, for example, the beta for IBM was reported as 0.97 by MarketWatch and as 1.25 by\nYahoo! Finance.\nThe CAPM estimate of the cost of equity capital for IBM is significantly different depending on what source is\nused for the company’s beta and what value is used for the market risk premium. Using a market risk\npremium of 5%, the beta of 0.97 provided by MarketWatch, and a risk-free rate of 3% results in a cost of capital\nof\nIf, instead, a market risk premium of 8% and the beta of 1.25 provided by Yahoo! Finance are used, the cost of\ncapital is estimated to be\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating the Equity Cost of Capital\nAlthough the calculation of the cost of capital using the CAPM equation is simple and straightforward, there\nis not one definitive equity cost of capital for a company that all financial managers will agree on. Consider\nthe eight companies spotlighted in Table 17.3.\nFour estimates of the equity cost of capital are calculated for each firm. The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%. If you assume instead that the\naverage long-run return on the S&P 500 is 11%, then people who purchase a portfolio of those stocks are\nrewarded by earning 8 percentage points more than the 3% they would earn investing in the risk-free\nsecurity.\nThe last two estimates of the cost of equity capital for each company also use the same risk-free rate of 3%\nand the possible market risk premiums of 5% and 8%. The only difference is that the beta provided by\nYahoo! Finance is used in the calculation.\nCompany\nIndustry\nMarketWatch\nYahoo!

The lack of any debt in the capital structure means the firm\nwould have no financial leverage. The equity in a firm that has no financial leverage is called unlevered\nequity.\nThe Levered Firm\nNext, consider borrowing some of the money that you will need to start this T-shirt business. Although the\ncash flows from the business are uncertain, suppose you are certain that the business will generate at least\n$18,000. (Perhaps you have a guaranteed order from the cycling competition sponsors.) If you borrowed\n$17,000 at the risk-free interest rate of 4%, you would owe\nto the lenders at the\nend of the year. Because you are certain that you will generate at least $18,000 in cash, which is greater than\n$17,680, you can borrow the $17,000 without any risk of defaulting.\nThe $17,000 will not be enough to pay for all the start-up costs. You will also need to raise some capital by\nselling equity. Because your firm will have some debt, or financial leverage, the equity that you raise will be\nknown as levered equity. The equity holders expect the firm to generate $52,000 in cash flows. Debt holders\nmust be paid before equity holders, so this will leave\nfor the shareholders.\nThe expected future cash flows generated by the business are determined by the productivity of its assets, not\nthe manner in which those assets are financed. It is the present value of these expected future cash flows that\ndetermines the firm’s value. Thus, the firm’s value in perfect capital markets will not change as a result of the\ncompany taking on leverage.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nMM Proposition I\nNobel laureates Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller wrote influential papers exploring capital structure\nand the cost of a firm’s capital. They began by considering what would occur in a perfectly competitive\nmarket. One of the assumptions of this perfect capital market is that there are no taxes. The idea that the\nmarket value of the unlevered and levered firm is the same in perfect capital markets is known in the field\nof finance as MM Proposition I.\nVisit Milken Institute’s 5-Minute Finance site to explore more about Modigliani and Miller’s contributions\n(https://openstax.org/r/Modigliani) to the understanding of capital structure.\nThe value of your T-shirt business remains at $45,614. You can calculate the value of the levered equity as\nNow, shareholders are willing to pay $28,614 for ownership in this company. They expect to get $34,320 in one\nyear in return for purchasing this equity. What discount rate does this imply?\n17.4 • Capital Structure Choices\n517\nNotice that the expected return to shareholders has risen from 14% for the unlevered firm to 19.94% for the\nlevered firm. Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.\nWhy does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders. Equity holders\nare residual claimants; they will only receive payment if there is money left over after the debt holders are fully\npaid. The business is risky. You are certain that the company will have cash flow of at least $18,000 at the end\nof the year and that $17,680 will be paid to the debt holders. Therefore, if the company performs poorly\n(perhaps bad weather results in the cancellation of much of the cycling competition) and the cash flows fall\nway below what you are expecting, there may be only several hundred dollars left for the shareholders.\nWhen the firm was unlevered, if the cash flow at the end of the year was only $18,000, the shareholders would\nreceive $18,000. When leverage is used, the same cash flow would result in shareholders receiving only $320.\nThe risk to the shareholders increases as leverage is used; thus, the risk premium that shareholders require\nalso increases as leverage is used.\nLeverage and the WACC\nWhat happens to the WACC as leverage is used? To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\nequity in the capital structure:\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a",

If the company needs to issue new shares of stock, flotation costs are\nexpected to be $0.75 per share.\nGiven this information, you are tasked with calculating the company’s WACC. You need to provide an\nestimate of WACC if retained earnings are used and an estimate if new equity must be issued.\nSolution:\nFirst, calculate the cost of equity capital for AMW using the constant dividend growth model:\nUsing 12.57% as the equity cost of capital and 4.6% as the after-tax cost of debt, the WACC is calculated as\nThe WACC for AMW when it is using retained earnings for equity financing is 10.18%.

These corporate bonds have a provision that gives the bondholder\nthe option of converting each bond held into a fixed number of shares of common stock. The number of\ncommon shares the bondholder would receive for each bond is known as the conversion ratio.\nSuppose that you own a convertible bond issued by Sheridan Sodas with a face value of $1,000 and a\nconversion ratio of 20 shares that matures today. If you convert the bond today, you will receive 20 shares of\nSheridan common stock. If you do not convert, you will receive $1,000. If you convert, you are basically paying\n$1,000 for 20 shares of Sheridan stock. The conversion price is\nIf Sheridan is trading for more\nthan $50 per share, you would want to convert. If Sheridan is trading for less than $50 per share, you would\nnot want to convert; you would prefer the $1,000. In other words, you will choose to convert whenever the\nstock price exceeds the conversion price at maturity.\nA convertible bond gives the holder an option; the bondholder is able to choose between the face value cash\nor receiving shares of stock. Options always have a positive value to holders. It is always preferable to be able\nto choose $1,000 or shares of stock than to simply be given $1,000. There is a possibility that the shares of\nstock will be more valuable, and there is no way the choice can put you in a worse position.\nBecause holders of convertible bonds have the valuable option of conversion that holders of nonconvertible\nbonds do not have, convertible debt can be offered with a lower interest rate. It might seem as if the firm\ncould lower its weighted average cost of capital by issuing convertible debt rather than nonconvertible debt.\nHowever, this is not the case. Remember that holders of convertible bonds choose whether they would prefer\nto convert the bond and become a stockholder or receive the face value of the bond at maturity.\nIf a bond has a face value of $1,000, the convertible bond holders will consider whether the stock they can\nconvert to is worth more than $1,000. Only when the price of the stock has increased enough that the value of\nthe stock received is more than $1,000 will the bondholders convert. However, this means that instead of\npaying $1,000, the firm is paying the bondholder in stock worth more than $1,000. In essence, the firm (and\nthe current shareholders) would be selling an equity position in the company for less than the market price of\nthat equity position. The lower interest rate compensates for the possibility that conversion will occur.\n528\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n17.1 The Concept of Capital Structure\nCapital structure refers to how a company finances its assets.

The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are\nrequiring to lend money to the company. Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the\ncompany is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must\nestimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend\ngrowth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n17.3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nCalculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the formula\nRemember that the WACC is an estimate; different methods of estimating the cost of equity capital can lead to\ndifferent estimations of WACC.\n17.4 Capital Structure Choices\nAn unlevered firm uses no debt in its capital structure. A levered firm uses both debt and equity in its capital\nstructure. In perfect financial markets, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the firm’s decision\nto use leverage. With the tax deductibility of interest expenses, however, the value of the firm can increase\nthrough the use of debt. As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.\n17.5 Optimal Capital Structure\nA company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases. Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt\nequals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.\n17.6 Alternative Sources of Funds\nPreferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over\ncommon stockholders in the order of claimants. A fixed dividend is paid to preferred shareholders and must\nbe paid before common shareholders receive dividends. Equity capital can be raised through either retaining\nearnings or selling new shares of stock. Significant flotation costs are associated with issuing new shares of\nstock, making it the most expensive source of financing. Convertible debt allows the debt holders to convert\ntheir debt into a fixed number of common shares instead of receiving the face value of the stock at maturity.\nKey Terms\nafter-tax cost of debt\nthe net cost of interest on a company’s debt after taxes; the firm’s effective cost of\ndebt\ncapital\na company’s sources of financing\n17 • Summary\n529\ncapital structure\nthe percentages of a company’s assets that are financed by debt capital, preferred stock\ncapital, and common stock capital\nconversion price\nthe face value of a convertible bond divided by its conversion ratio\nconversion ratio\nthe number of shares of common stock receivable for each convertible bond that is\nconverted\nconvertible bonds\nbonds that can be converted into a fixed number of shares of common stock upon\nmaturity\nfinancial distress\nwhen a firm has trouble meeting debt obligations\nfinancial leverage\nthe debt used in a company’s capital structure\nflotation costs\ncosts involved in the issuing and placing of new securities\ninterest tax shield\nthe reduction in taxes paid because interest payments on debt are a tax-deductible\nexpense; calculated as the corporate tax rate multiplied by interest payments\nlevered equity\nequity in a firm that has debt outstanding\nnet debt\na company’s total debt minus any cash or risk-free assets the company holds\npreferred stock\nequity capital that has a fixed dividend; preferred shareholders fall in between debt holders\nand common stockholders in the order of claimants\ntrade-off theory\na theory stating that the total value of a levered company is the value of the firm without\nleverage plus the value of the interest tax shield less financial distress costs\nunlevered equity\nequity in a firm that has no debt outstanding\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC)\nthe average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted\nby the fractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity\nCFA Institute\nThis chapter supports some of the Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) in this CFA® Level I Study Session",

This is called forecasting. Accounting and finance professionals use past performance\nalong with what they know about the business, its competitors, the economy, and the company’s plans for the\nfuture to assemble detailed financial forecasts. Forecasts are useful to many individuals for different reasons.\nA budget, a type of static forecast, helps accountants and managers see how their plans for the coming year\ncan be achieved. It outlines sales targets and how much can be spent on cost of goods sold and expenses to\nachieve the company’s bottom-line (net income) targets. Investors use financial forecasts to help guide their\ndecisions to buy, sell or hold stocks or to estimate future potential income through dividends. Perhaps most\nimportantly, for our purposes in finance, forecasts are used to help predict and manage cash flows.\nA business can have all the profit in the world at the end of the year, but if it doesn’t raise enough cash\n(liquidity) to pay the bills and pay its employees halfway through the year, it could still go bankrupt despite\nbeing profitable. Forecasting sales and expenses helps assemble a cash forecast—when sales will be collected\nand when expenses will be paid—so that financial managers can look forward far enough to have enough time\nto react accordingly and secure short- or long-term financing to meet gaps in cash flow.\nFinancial Forecasting\n18\n18 • Why It Matters\n535\n18.1\nThe Importance of Forecasting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss how to use financial statements in forecasting firm financials.\n•\nExplain why balance sheet items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\n•\nExplain why income statement items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\nIn this section, we will briefly review some of the basic elements of financial statements and how we can\nanalyze historical statements to help assemble financial forecasts. Financial forecasting is important to short-\nand long-term firm success. It helps a firm plan for the resources it will need, ensuring it will have enough cash\non hand at the right time to cover daily operations and capital expenditures. It helps the firm communicate its\nfuture potential and manage its shareholders’ expectations. It also helps management assess future risk and\nset plans in place to mitigate that risk.\nFinancial forecasting involves using historical data, analysis tools, and other information we can gather to\nmake an educated guess about the future financial performance of the firm. Historical figures provide a\nreasonable starting point. We use tools such as ratios, common size, and trend analysis to fine-tune our\nforecast. And finally, we assess what we know about the firm, its competitors, the economy, and anything else\nthat might impact performance and further fine-tune our forecast from there.\nIt’s important to take a moment to consider the role of ethics in forecasting. Ethics is a huge issue in the world\nof accounting and finance in general, and forecasting is no different. There can be tremendous pressure on\nmanagement to perform, to deliver certain levels of profit, and to meet shareholder expectations.\nForecasting, as you will learn throughout this chapter, is not an exact science. There is a great deal of\nsubjectivity that can come into play when forecasting sales and expenses. Ethical behavior is crucial in this\narea. Those who create forecasts must have a firm understanding of where their data comes from, how\nreliable it is, and whether or not their assumptions and projections are reasonably justified.\nFinancial Statement Foundations\nIn Financial Statements, you were introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods. You learned about\nthe four key financial statements: the income statement, balance sheet, statement of stockholders’\nequity, and statement of cash flows. Each one provides a different view of the firm’s financial health and\nperformance.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods is a small merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells\nthem to consumers) that sells hunting and fishing gear. It uses financial statements to understand its\nprofitability and current financial position, to manage cash flow, and to communicate its finances to outside\nparties such as investors, governing bodies, and lenders. We will use Clear Lake’s company information and\nhistorical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that\nin this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast\nfinancial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to",

We will use Clear Lake’s company information and\nhistorical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that\nin this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast\nfinancial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to\nforecast their financial performance differently. We are demonstrating just one approach here.\nThe balance sheet shows all the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity at one point in time. It also supports the\naccounting equation in a very clear and transparent way. We find one section of the balance sheet contains all\ncurrent and noncurrent assets that must total the other section of the balance sheet: total liabilities and\nequity. In Figure 18.2, we see that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has total assets of $250,000 in the current year,\nwhich balances with its total liabilities and equity of $250,000.\n536\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.2 Balance Sheet\nThe income statement reflects the performance of the firm over a period of time. It includes net sales, cost of\ngoods sold, operating expenses, and net income. In Figure 18.3, we see that Clear Lake had $120,000 in net\nsales, $60,000 in cost of goods sold, and $35,000 in net income in the current year.\nFigure 18.3 Full Income Statement\nFinally, the statement of cash flows is used to reconcile net income to cash balances. The statement begins\nwith net income, then reflects adjustments to balance sheet accounts and noncash expenses. The statement of\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n537\ncash flows is broken down into three key categories: operating, investing, and financing. This allows users to\nclearly see what elements of the business are generating or using cash. In Figure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake\nhad cash flow from operating activities of $53,600, cash used for investing activities of ($18,600), and cash\nused for financing activities of ($15,000).\nFigure 18.4 Statement of Cash Flows\nAnother key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is\nnecessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance. This means that total assets\n(what the company owns) must equal total liabilities and equity (what the company owes).\n538\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to\nuse elements of the balance sheet to assess financial health. Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis.

It’s critical that all members of the team take the time and effort to research their\ncustomers and the factors that impact their business in order to effectively assess the impact of these factors\non future sales. Though only two adjustments were made here, it’s likely that a large firm would have to\nconsider many, many factors that would ultimately impact monthly sales figures before arriving at a\nconclusion.\n18.3\nPro Forma Financials\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine pro forma in the context of a financial forecast.\n•\nDescribe the factors that impact the length of a financial forecast.\n•\nExplain the risks associated with a financial forecast.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will move beyond the sales forecast and look at the general nature, length,\nand timeline of forecasts and the risks associated with using them. We’ll look at why we use them, how long\nthey generally are, what the key variables in a forecast are, and how we pair those variables with common-size\nanalysis to develop the forecast.\nPurpose of a Forecast\nAs mentioned earlier in the chapter, forecasts serve different purposes depending on who is using them. Our\nfocus here, however, is the world of finance. In this realm, the key purpose of pro forma (future-looking)\nfinancial statements is to manage a firm’s cash flow and assess the overall value that the firm is generating\nthrough future sales growth. Growing just for the sake of growing doesn’t always yield favorable income for\nthe firm. A larger top-line sales figure that results in lower net income doesn’t make sense in the grand\nscheme of things. The same is true of profitable sales that don’t generate enough cash flows at the right time.\nThe firm may make a profit, but if it doesn’t manage the timing of its cash flows, it could be forced to shut\ndown if it can’t cover the costs of payroll or keep the lights on. Forecasting helps assess both cash flow and the\nprofitability of future growth. Managers can forecast cash flow using data from forecasted financial\nstatements; this allows them to identify potential gaps in cash and plan ahead in order to either alter collection\nand payment policies or obtain funding to cover the gap in the timing of cash flows.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPro Forma Financial Statements\nReview the video Business Plan and Pro-Forma Financial Statements (https://openstax.org/r/\nBusiness_Plan_and_Pro-Forma_Financial_Statements) to learn about the basics of pro forma financial\nstatements and why they are helpful.\n544\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLength of a Forecast\nForecasts can generally be for any length of time. The length generally depends on the user’s needs. A one-\nyear forecast, broken down by month, is quite typical. A firm will often go through a formal budgeting process\nnear the end of its calendar or fiscal year to project financial plans and goals for the coming year. Once that is\ndone, a rolling financial forecast is then done monthly to adjust as time moves on, more information becomes\navailable, and circumstances change.\nTo be useful, the future forecast for financial planning purposes is almost always calculated as monthly\nincrements rather than one total figure for the next 12 months. Breaking the data down by month allows\nfinance managers to more clearly see fluctuations in cash flows in and out, identify potential gaps in cash flow,\nand plan ahead for their cash needs.\nForecasts can also be done for several years into the future. In fact, they commonly are. However, once the\nfirm is looking out beyond 12 months, it gets difficult to forecast items with a great degree of accuracy. Often,\nforecasts beyond a year will be completed only to quarterly or even annual figures rather than monthly.\nForecasts that far into the future are often strategic in nature, made more to communicate future plans for the\nfirm than for more detailed decision-making and cash flow planning.\nCommon-Size Financials\nAs we saw earlier in the chapter, common-size analysis involves using historical financial statements as a basis\nfor future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements",

Figure 18.13 shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods using all of this data.\nFigure 18.13 Forecasted Income Statement\nForecast the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales. Thus, Clear Lake estimates its\nunearned revenue balance each month by taking the current month’s net sales from the forecasted income\nstatement and multiplying it by 50%.\nShort-term investments, notes payable, and common stock are not anticipated to change, so the current\nbalance is forecasted to remain the same for the next 12 months.\n548\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo forecast the ending balance for retained earnings for each month, managers add the monthly net income\nfrom the forecasted balance sheet to the prior balance and subtract a quarterly $10,000 dividend.\nOnce all of these accounts are completed, the balance sheet is out of balance. Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable. Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),\nand the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other\nexpenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.\nWe learned in Financial Statements that net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.",

It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth\nIt’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow. While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months. Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential",

Additional information can be used to\nadjust the formulas, as we saw with the 2% reduction in January sales for the forecasted income statement.\nBecause we have linked most (though not all) of our expenses, subtotals, and statements together using\nformulas, management can also use the forecast workbook to perform scenario and sensitivity analyses,\nessentially asking “what if?” and looking at the results. When completed, however, before finalizing the\nforecast, it’s important that the financial statements are in balance (particularly the balance sheet, just as the\nname implies).\nNotice that throughout, we used formulas to calculate subtotals to ensure they are correct and change as\nneeded. We also linked figures, such as the ending and beginning cash balances, to ensure they are in balance.\nPerhaps the easiest but most important thing to do is to ensure that the balance sheet balances. We can do\nthis with a simple formula that compares total assets to total liabilities and equity. We can see in Figure 18.23\nthat subtracting one from the other in cell C27 should result in $0. If there is a difference, the formula will\nhighlight it, forcing us to investigate and correct the sheet so that it balances.\n18.6 • Using Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\n557\nFigure 18.23 Forecasted Balancing Formula\n558\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n18.1 The Importance of Forecasting\nForecasting financial statements is important to different users for different reasons. In finance, it’s most\nimportant for assessing the value of future growth plans and planning for future cash flow needs.\n18.2 Forecasting Sales\nThe sales forecast is the foundation on which much of the rest of the forecast is built. Thus, the sales forecast\nis completed first. Historical sales data and any other information on the firm, its products, the economy, its\ncustomers, and its competitors are all used to create the most accurate sales forecast possible.\n18.3 Pro Forma Financials\nPro forma financial statements are forward looking in nature. They use the sales forecast, historical data,\nfinancial statement analyses, relationships between accounts and statements, and any other information\nknown about the firm, the environment, and the future to create the most accurate financial statement\nforecast possible.\n18.4 Generating the Complete Forecast\nInterrelationships among historical data, the forecasted income statement, and the forecasted balance sheet\nare all used to estimate each line item in the financial statements.\n18.5 Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\nOnce the income statement and balance sheet forecasts are complete, data from those statements,\ninformation on company policies, and account relationships are used to generate a cash forecast. The cash\nforecast is important for identifying any gaps in cash flow so that financial managers can plan for cash needs.\nIt’s also important to review not only the cash forecast but all forecasted financial statements to assess the\noverall impact and value of proposed firm growth.\n18.6 Using Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\nExcel can be a powerful tool for creating financial forecasts. Formulas that complete mathematical functions\nand tie accounts and financial statements together are used to create the statements, ensure that they\nbalance, and facilitate scenario and sensitivity analyses.\nKey Terms\nbalance sheet\na financial statement that reflects a firm’s asset, liability, and equity account balances at a\ngiven point in time\ncash deficit\nan excess of cash outflows over cash inflows for a given period\ncash forecast\na financial statement that estimates a firm’s future cash inflows and outflows\ncash surplus\nan excess of cash inflows over cash outflows for a given period\ncommon-size\ndescribes a financial statement in which each element is expressed as a percentage of a base\namount\nfinancing activities\ncash business transactions reported on the statement of cash flows that reflect the use\nof financed funds\nforecast\nan estimate of future performance based on historical performance and other contextual\ninformation\nincome statement\na financial statement that measures a firm’s financial performance over a given period of\ntime\ninvesting activities\ncash business transactions reported on the statement of cash flows that reflect the\nacquisition or disposal of long-term assets\n18 • Summary\n559\noperating activities\ncash business transactions reported on the statement of cash flows that relate to\nongoing day-to-day operations\npro forma\nin the context of financial statements, forward-looking\nscenario analysis\nanalysis of how various situations and circumstances would impact the financial forecast\nsensitivity analysis",

In personal finance, financial resiliency is the ability to overcome financial difficulties such as sudden\njob loss or significant unexpected expenses—to spring back quickly.\nTo help promote resiliency, personal financial planners advise clients to maintain liquid assets equal to three\nto six months of living expenses, keep debt levels low, manage the household budget, keep insurance in force\n(health, property, and life), establish a solid credit history, and make wise use of credit cards and home equity\nlines of credit.\nIn business finance, financial resiliency is not important only during pandemics but is important through the\nups and downs of seasonal cycles and economic downturns. Managing cash, accounts receivable, and\ninventory while making optimal use of trade credit (accounts payable) makes for a business that meets its\noperating needs and pays its debts when due.\nWorking capital management is also critical during good times.
