Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by \nSpain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \ninternational community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet \nUnion, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders. \nWhen Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly \nfor home turf rather than share power.

In \nthe fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people. The process of electing \nstate judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign \ncontributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings. \n \nIn the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other \nelected officials (the Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of \nSenate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes.

Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between.

To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law.

In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge?

The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes.

The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey.

A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource.

The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court.

If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft.

But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions \nabout what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. \n2.

Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law. There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it. Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n46 \nperception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials). \n• \nThe goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for.

Utilitarianism Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 50 Utilitarianism is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is well aligned with economics and the free-market outlook that has come to dominate much current thinking about business, management, and economics. Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill (who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. Utilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or right if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for legislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced individually and by corporations. Bentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society would be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad consequences of each. He called this process “calculus” and believed that the legislature could calculate the consequences of various policies and then choose the one with the best consequences. He also thought that individuals could apply the same principles in their own decision making. The idea is to do what produces the most happiness and the least pain. In the business world, this means that a company should try to produce the greatest good for the greatest number. In a utilitarian view, the best companies will be those that make the most money, because making the most money is the same as producing the most good for the greatest number of people. Utilitarianism is often called “consequentialism” because it emphasizes the consequences of an action. Utilitarianism is not without its critics. It has been criticized for being too simplistic and for failing to consider the rights of individuals. It is also criticized for not being able to account for the value of things such as art and beauty. Deontology Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 51 Deontology is a philosophical term that means the study of duty. Immanuel Kant is considered the founder of this perspective. He believed that people have duties and obligations that are unchangeable and unalterable. In other words, there are certain things that are right and certain things that are wrong. These things are not right or wrong because of the consequences they produce. They are right or wrong because they are right or wrong. For example, Kant believed that lying was always wrong, regardless of the consequences. In the business world, this means that certain actions are wrong, and no amount of money or profit will make them right. Virtue theory Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 52 Virtue theory is a perspective that emphasizes the importance of character in decision making. This perspective is based on the belief that character is important and that people should develop good character. Aristotle was the founder of this perspective. He believed that people should develop certain virtues, such as courage, temperance, and wisdom. These virtues are important because they help people make good decisions. In the business world, this means that people should develop good character. This is important because people with good character are more likely to make good decisions. Social justice and social contract theory Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 53 Social justice and social contract theory is a perspective that emphasizes the importance of fairness and equality. This perspective is based on the belief that people should be treated fairly and equally. John Rawls is considered the founder of this perspective. He believed that people should be treated fairly and equally because it is the right thing to do. In the business world, this means that people should be treated fairly and equally. This is important because it helps to create a fair and just society. "

The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved.

The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number.

It can also be used to evaluate smaller decisions, such as whether to purchase a new piece of equipment for a business. In general, cost-benefit analysis is a useful tool for making decisions that involve trade-offs between costs and benefits. It can help to ensure that decisions are made in a way that maximizes the overall benefits while minimizing the costs."

A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job",

If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people?

Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice. \n \nFrom a modern perspective, some of these virtues seem old-fashioned or even odd.

You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical.

In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods \nMarket, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come \nfirst, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 \"Corporations \nand Corporate Governance\"). \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n62 \nThe Core Values \nHere are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nTrustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be \nsincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and \ndon’t betray a trust.

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities?

Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations.

As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers. But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs.

At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year \nperiod.

After the American Revolution, state courts \nfunctioned (with some differences) much like they did in colonial times. The big difference after 1789 was \nthat state courts coexisted with federal courts. Federalism was the system devised by the nation’s \nfounders in which power is shared between states and the federal government. This sharing requires a \ndivision of labor between the states and the federal government. It is Article III of the US Constitution \nthat spells out the respective spheres of authority (jurisdiction) between state and federal courts. \n \nTake a close look at Article III of the Constitution.

The court system is composed of a number of different courts, each with its own jurisdiction and rules of procedure. The most common types of courts are state courts and federal courts. State courts have jurisdiction over cases involving state law, while federal courts have jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. The court system is also divided into different levels, with the highest level being the Supreme Court.

Rudzewicz, Section 3.9 \"Cases\", the federal \ncourt in Florida had to consider whether it was constitutionally permissible to exercise personal \njurisdiction over a Michigan franchisee. \n \nAgain, recall that even if a court has subject matter jurisdiction, it must also have personal jurisdiction \nover each defendant against whom an enforceable judgment can be made. Often this is not a problem; you \nmight be suing a person who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state. Or a nonresident \nmay answer your complaint without objecting to the court’s “in personam” (personal) jurisdiction. But \nmany defendants who do not reside in the state where the lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the \ninconvenience of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum. Fairness—and the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment—dictates that nonresidents should not be required to defend lawsuits far from \ntheir home base, especially where there is little or no contact or connection between the nonresident and \nthe state where a lawsuit is brought. \n \nSummary of Rules on Personal Jurisdiction \n1. \nOnce a court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction, it must find at least one defendant \nover which it is “fair” (i.e., in accord with due process) to exercise personal jurisdiction. \n2. If a plaintiff sues five defendants and the court has personal jurisdiction over just one, the case \ncan be heard, but the court cannot make a judgment against the other four. \n1. \nBut if the plaintiff loses against defendant 1, he can go elsewhere (to another state or \nstates) and sue defendants 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n2. The court’s decision in the first lawsuit (against defendant 1) does not determine the \nliability of the nonparticipating defendants. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n103 \nThis involves the principle of res judicata, which means that you can’t bring the same action \nagainst the same person (or entity) twice. It’s like the civil side of double jeopardy. Res means \n“thing,” and judicata means “adjudicated.” Thus the “thing” has been “adjudicated” and \nshould not be judged again. But, as to nonparticipating parties, it is not over. If you have \na different case against the same defendant—one that arises out of a completely different \nsituation—that case is not barred by res judicata. \n3. Service of process is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting personal jurisdiction \nover a particular defendant (see rule 4).",

The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years.

Some minor cases do not \nrequire a unanimous verdict. If the jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the case \nwill have to be retried. When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their \nlawyers present. The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge. (If there is no \njury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to \nthose facts. Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto).

This is a safer way to proceed because if the judge is reversed on \nappeal, a new trial is not necessary. The jury’s verdict always can be restored, whereas without a jury \nverdict (as happens when a directed verdict is granted before the case goes to the jury), the entire case \nmust be presented to a new jury.

But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue?

Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n \nLegal Fees \nLawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. \nA flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance \napproximately how long it will take her to do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are \nexamples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the \nworth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price. \n \nLawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial \nmatters. Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range \nfrom $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time. \n \nA contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the \nsuccess of the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., \nautomobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite often, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n125 \ncontingent fee is controversial.

Few people have that kind of \nmoney or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit.

As you look at \nthe Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it \nmay impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign \nand domestic.” \n \nIn Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives \nare elected to public office. Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and \nsmall states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states \nhave two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the \npresidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. \nArticle II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the \nelection process.

Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware). The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so",

The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In \ndeciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the \nSupreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the \nConstitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its \ninterpretation.

The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the \nlabor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact \nthat they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to \nfederal control under the commerce power.” \n \nIn short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between \nstates. Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it \na fit subject for national regulation. The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a \nmatter of local regulation.

But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce.

For example, \nCongress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in \nlength. But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and \nlength of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules. States may do so under the so-\ncalled historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government. \nThese police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, \nmorals, and the environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when \nstate action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate. This power is \nclaimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause. \n \nThere are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an \n“undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be \nstruck down. Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 \"Summary and Exercises\", is an example \nof a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on \nits highways.

A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white \nchildren and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public \nservices, such as water fountains or restrooms. Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954).

To know what classifications are \npermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified. The court has \ncreated three classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by \nknowing how the court is likely to classify the case: \n \n• \nMinimal scrutiny: economic and social relations. Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights. Classifications based on any of these are \nalmost never upheld. \n \nUnder minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues \nare presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen.

It has been \nhis practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; \nto sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use \nsome in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. \n \nHis 1941 wheat acreage allotment was 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He \nsowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under \nthe terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty \nof 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. \n \nThe general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the \nvolume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the \nconsequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce.

Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce \nimposed by Iowa’s law. On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests.",

Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic.

Washington apple \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n187 \ngrowers annually ship in commerce approximately 40 million closed containers of apples, nearly 500,000 \nof which eventually find their way into North Carolina, stamped with the applicable Washington State \nvariety and grade. [Compliance] with North Carolina’s unique regulation would have required \nWashington growers to obliterate the printed labels on containers shipped to North Carolina, thus giving \ntheir product a damaged appearance. Alternatively, they could have changed their marketing practices to \naccommodate the needs of the North Carolina market, i.e., repack apples to be shipped to North Carolina \nin containers bearing only the USDA grade, and/or store the estimated portion of the harvest destined for \nthat market in such special containers. As a last resort, they could discontinue the use of the preprinted \ncontainers entirely. None of these costly and less efficient options was very attractive to the industry. \nMoreover, in the event a number of other States followed North Carolina’s lead, the resultant inability to \ndisplay the Washington grades could force the Washington growers to abandon the State’s expensive \ninspection and grading system which their customers had come to know and rely on over the 60-odd \nyears of its existence.… \n \nUnsuccessful in its attempts to secure administrative relief [with North Carolina], the Commission \ninstituted this action challenging the constitutionality of the statute. [The] District Court found that the \nNorth Carolina statute, while neutral on its face, actually discriminated against Washington State growers",

We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system.

Once again, the statute had no similar \nimpact on the North Carolina apple industry and thus operated to its benefit. \n \nThird, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, \nthe statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers. \n[With] free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage \nvis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior.

Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the \nGovernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” \n \n… \n \nThe Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784. The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of \ncorporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply \nbecause such associations are not “natural persons.” \n \nThe purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations, \nfrom presenting both facts and opinions to the public. This makes Austin’s antidistortion rationale all the \nmore an aberration. “[T]he First Amendment protects the right of corporations to petition legislative and \nadministrative bodies.” Bellotti, 435 U.S., at 792, n. 31.… \n \nEven if §441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected \nofficials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so.

Hallock, 309 U.S. 106 at \n119 (1940). \n \nAustin is undermined by experience since its announcement. Political speech is so ingrained in our \nculture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws. See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U.S., at \n176–177 (“Given BCRA’s tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives…to \nexploit [26 U.S.C. §527] organizations will only increase”). Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and \ninformative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment \nrights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted \nmessages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic \nviews. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to \npoint out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials. \n \nRapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression—\ncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. \nToday, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. Soon, \nhowever, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide \ncitizens with significant information about political candidates and issues. Yet, §441b would seem to ban a \nblog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with \ncorporate funds. The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions \nbased on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech. \n \nDue consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is overruled. We return to the \nprinciple established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech on \nthe basis of the speaker’s corporate identity.

The heads, whether a single \nadministrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively \nlimited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making \noccurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting \ndata and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies. \n \nThe Constitution and Agencies \nCongress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of \ngovernmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. \nThe most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National",

The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes.

For many years, the \ngovernment insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a \nwarrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an \nunderage patron to the store). Or a junkyard that specializes in automobiles and automobile parts may \nalso be subject to surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly likely to be active in the \nresale of stolen autos or stolen auto parts.

The purpose of a surprise inspection is to ensure that the business is complying with all relevant regulations and standards, and to detect any potential violations or problems before they become serious. Surprise inspections can be conducted by government agencies, industry regulators, or independent third-party inspectors. They are typically unannounced and may occur at any time, even when the business is not open or operating. Surprise inspections can be a source of stress and anxiety for businesses, as they are not given any advance notice or opportunity to prepare for the inspection.

The warrant must specify the location to be searched and the items or evidence that may be seized. The warrant is typically obtained before the search takes place, and it must be executed by law enforcement officers who are authorized to carry out searches. The search warrant is an important tool for law enforcement officers to gather evidence and protect the rights of citizens.

If the court were to make an exception, it would \npermit executive officials in effect to make binding payments, even though unauthorized, simply by \nmisrepresenting the facts. The harsh reality, therefore, is that mistakes of the government are generally \nheld against the individual, not the government, unless the law specifically provides for recompense (as, \nfor example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act just discussed). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAfter exhausting administrative remedies, there are numerous grounds for seeking judicial review of an",

A traditional \ncriminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal \nversus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we \nwill consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights. \nUnlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes \ninvolve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state \ngovernment). This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be fair, citizens must \nhave clear notice of what is criminally prohibited. Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to \npunish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly \nvague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for \nvagueness.” \n \nWhat is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time.

The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force.

That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of \nreceiving an immediate battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases.

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law.

A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car. If the finance company repossesses the car, the \ncustomer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have \ntaken the new car by larceny or embezzlement. Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the \ndealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying.

Many people can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is unnecessary \nto show that the actions they took were sufficient to constitute either the crime or an attempt.

In general, though, the requirement means that the accused must in some way have intended the \ncriminal consequences of his act. Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison capsule to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n259 \nswallow. That is the act. If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his \nstate of mind was. Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her, the act was murder. \nWhat if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison but believing that it would only make her \nmildly ill? The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that \nmay cause harm to others. But suppose that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her two \npills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) \nbut that turned out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he had neither intent nor a state of \nknowledge from which intent could be inferred.",

Under certain circumstances, however, ignorance of law will be excused.

Otherwise, as it is said, \nthe lawyer would be superior to the law. \n \nIgnorance or mistake of fact more frequently will serve as an excuse.

Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence. \n \n \nSearch and Seizure \nThe rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that \nmake up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.

If a defendant is convicted and \nhis conviction is upheld on appeal, he may not thereafter be reprosecuted for the same crime. \n \nSelf-Incrimination \nThe Fifth Amendment is also the source of a person’s right against self-incrimination (no person “shall be \ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself”). The debate over the limits of this right \nhas given rise to an immense literature. In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means \nthat the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the \njury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded \nfrom evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession). \nIn Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that no confession is admissible if the police have not \nfirst advised a suspect of his constitutional rights, including the right to have a lawyer present to advise \nhim during the questioning. [1] These so-called Miranda warnings have prompted scores of follow-up cases \nthat have made this branch of jurisprudence especially complex. \n \n \nSpeedy Trial \nThe Sixth Amendment tells the government that it must try defendants speedily. How long a delay is too \nlong depends on the circumstances in each case. In 1975, Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give \npriority to criminal cases in federal courts. It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within \nseventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible reasons for delay). \n \nCross-Examination",

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.

Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states",

This means that the defendant must have done something wrong in order for the plaintiff to be able to receive compensation. This is different from criminal law, where the defendant must have had a specific intent to commit the crime. In tort law, the defendant's actions do not have to be intentional, but they must have been negligent or careless in some way. This means that the defendant did not take proper precautions or acted in a way that was unreasonable. The fault dimension in tort law is important because it helps to ensure that people are held accountable for their actions and that victims are able to receive compensation for any injuries or damages that they may have suffered."

A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other.

There was a contract between the plaintiff and a third party. \n2. The defendant knew of the contract. \n3. The defendant improperly induced the third party to breach the contract or made performance of the \ncontract impossible. \n4. There was injury to the plaintiff. \n \nIn a famous case of contract interference, Texaco was sued by Pennzoil for interfering with an agreement \nthat Pennzoil had with Getty Oil. After complicated negotiations between Pennzoil and Getty, a takeover \nshare price was struck, a memorandum of understanding was signed, and a press release announced the \nagreement in principle between Pennzoil and Getty. Texaco’s lawyers, however, believed that Getty oil was \n“still in play,” and before the lawyers for Pennzoil and Getty could complete the paperwork for their \nagreement, Texaco announced it was offering Getty shareholders an additional $12.50 per share over \nwhat Pennzoil had offered. \n \nTexaco later increased its offer to $228 per share, and the Getty board of directors soon began dealing \nwith Texaco instead of Pennzoil. Pennzoil decided to sue in Texas state court for tortious interference with \na contract. After a long trial, the jury returned an enormous verdict against Texaco: $7.53 billion in actual \ndamages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The verdict was so large that it would have bankrupted \nTexaco. Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution",

The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3]",

The problem for the law is to know when to draw the line between causes \nthat are immediate and causes too remote for liability reasonably to be assigned to them. In tort theory, \nthere are two kinds of causes that a plaintiff must prove: actual cause and proximate \ncause. Actual cause (causation in fact) can be found if the connection between the defendant’s act \nand the plaintiff’s injuries passes the “but for” test: if an injury would not have occurred “but for” the \ndefendant’s conduct, then the defendant is the cause of the injury. Still, this is not enough causation to \ncreate liability. The injuries to the plaintiff must also be foreseeable, or not “too remote,” for the \ndefendant’s act to create liability.

Although Judge \nCardozo persuaded four of his seven brethren to side with his position, the closeness of the case \ndemonstrates the difficulty that unforeseeable consequences and unforeseeable plaintiffs present. \n \nDamages \nFor a plaintiff to win a tort case, she must allege and prove that she was injured. The fear that she might \nbe injured in the future is not a sufficient basis for a suit. This rule has proved troublesome in medical \nmalpractice and industrial disease cases. A doctor’s negligent act or a company’s negligent exposure of a \nworker to some form of contamination might not become manifest in the body for years. In the meantime, \nthe tort statute of limitations might have run out, barring the victim from suing at all. An increasing \nnumber of courts have eased the plaintiff’s predicament by ruling that the statute of limitations does not \nbegin to run until the victim discovers that she has been injured or contracted a disease. \n \nThe law allows an exception to the general rule that damages must be shown when the plaintiff stands in \ndanger of immediate injury from a hazardous activity.

This fault is not synonymous with moral blame. \n \nAside from acts intended to harm, the fault lies in a failure to live up to a standard of reasonableness or \ndue care. But this is not the only basis for tort liability. Innocent mistakes can be a sufficient basis. As we \nhave already seen, someone who unknowingly trespasses on another’s property is liable for the damage \nthat he does, even if he has a reasonable belief that the land is his. And it has long been held that someone \nwho engages in ultrahazardous (or sometimes, abnormally dangerous) activities is liable for damage that \nhe causes, even though he has taken every possible precaution to avoid harm to someone else. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n307 \n \nLikewise, the owner of animals that escape from their pastures or homes and damage neighboring \nproperty may be liable, even if the reason for their escape was beyond the power of the owner to stop (e.g., \na fire started by lightning that burns open a barn door).

In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the \nlaw has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active \nmisconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps \nto protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373. Liability for nonfeasance was slow to \nreceive recognition in the law. “The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by \n‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has \nat least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his \naffairs.” Id. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) summarizes the law on this point as follows: \n \nThe fact that an actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s \naid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action. \n \nImposition of a duty in all such cases would simply not meet the test of fairness under contemporary \nstandards. \n \nIn nonfeasance cases the existence of a duty has been recognized only during the last century in situations \ninvolving a limited group of special relationships between parties. Such special relationships are \npredicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies \nthe imposition of a duty to act.” W. Keeton, § 56, at 374. Special relationships that have been recognized \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n316 \nby various courts for the purpose of imposition of a duty of care include common carrier/passenger, \ninnkeeper/guest, possessor of land/invited entrant, employer/employee, parent/child, and \nhospital/patient.See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 A (1965); 3 Harper and James, § 18.6, at 722–\n23.

Such an allocation of responsibility would “produce a repressive and \ninhospitable environment, largely inconsistent with the objectives of a modern college \neducation.” Beach, 726 P.2d at 419. \n \nThe evidence demonstrates that only in limited instances has the University attempted to impose \nregulations or restraints on the private recreational pursuits of its students, and the students have not \nlooked to the University to assure the safety of their recreational choices. Nothing in the University’s \nstudent handbook, which contains certain regulations concerning student conduct, reflects an effort by \nthe University to control the risk-taking decisions of its students in their private recreation.…Indeed, \nfraternity and sorority self-governance with minimal supervision appears to have been fostered by the \nUniversity. \n \n… \n \nAside from advising the Beta house on one occasion to put the trampoline up when not in use, there is no \nevidence that the University officials attempted to assert control over trampoline use by the fraternity \nmembers.

The rocket exploded near a crowd of onlookers, including Danny Klein. Klein’s clothing was \nset on fire, and he suffered facial burns and serious injury to his eyes. Klein sued Pyrodyne for strict \nliability to recover for his injuries. Pyrodyne asserted that the Chinese manufacturer of the fireworks was \nnegligent in producing the rocket and therefore Pyrodyne should not be held liable. The trial court applied \nthe doctrine of strict liability and held in favor of Klein. Pyrodyne appealed. \n \nSection 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that any party carrying on an “abnormally \ndangerous activity” is strictly liable for ensuing damages. The public display of fireworks fits this \ndefinition. The court stated: “Any time a person ignites rockets with the intention of sending them aloft to \nexplode in the presence of large crowds of people, a high risk of serious personal injury or property \ndamage is created. That risk arises because of the possibility that a rocket will malfunction or be \nmisdirected.” Pyrodyne argued that its liability was cut off by the Chinese manufacturer’s negligence. The \ncourt rejected this argument, stating, “Even if negligence may properly be regarded as an intervening \ncause, it cannot function to relieve Pyrodyne from strict liability.” \n \nThe Washington Supreme Court held that the public display of fireworks is an abnormally dangerous \nactivity that warrants the imposition of strict liability. \n \nAffirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why would certain activities be deemed ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous so that strict liability is \nimposed? \n2. If the activities are known to be abnormally dangerous, did Klein assume the risk? \n3. Assume that the fireworks were negligently manufactured in China. Should Klein’s only remedy be against \nthe Chinese company, as Pyrodyne argues?

Tort law has had a significant impact on business because modern \ntechnology poses significant dangers and the modern market is so efficient at distributing goods to a wide \nclass of consumers. \n \nUnlike criminal law, tort law does not require the tortfeasor to have a specific intent to commit the act for \nwhich he or she will be held liable to pay damages. Negligence—that is, carelessness—is a major factor in \ntort liability. In some instances, especially in cases involving injuries caused by products, a no-fault \nstandard called strict liability is applied. \n \nWhat constitutes a legal injury depends very much on the circumstances. A person can assume a risk or \nconsent to the particular action, thus relieving the person doing the injury from tort liability. To be liable, \nthe tortfeasor must be the proximate cause of the injury, not a remote cause. On the other hand, certain \npeople are held to answer for the torts of another—for example, an employer is usually liable for the torts \nof his employees, and a bartender might be liable for injuries caused by someone to whom he sold too \nmany drinks. Two types of statutes—workers’ compensation and no-fault automobile insurance—have \neliminated tort liability for certain kinds of accidents and replaced it with an immediate insurance \npayment plan. \n \nAmong the torts of particular importance to the business community are wrongful death and personal \ninjury caused by products or acts of employees, misrepresentation, defamation, and interference with \ncontractual relations. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n325 \n1.

Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law.

A \nrevision—the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979. \nThe Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, \nrestitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field. These analyses are \nmade with an eye to discerning the various principles that have emerged from the courts, and to the \nmaximum extent possible, the Restatements declare the law as the courts have determined it to be. The \nRestatements, guided by a Reporter (the director of the project) and a staff of legal scholars, go through \nseveral so-called “tentative” drafts—sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty—and are screened by various \ncommittees within the American Law Institute before they are eventually published as final documents. \n \nThe Restatement of Contracts won prompt respect in the courts and has been cited in innumerable cases. \nThe Restatements are not authoritative, in the sense that they are not actual judicial precedents, but they \nare nevertheless weighty interpretive texts, and judges frequently look to them for guidance.

A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding.

Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you. \nA voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing.

For example, Tom \nowes Pete money, but Pete has waited too long to collect it and the statute of limitations has run out. The \ncontract for repayment is unenforceable and Pete is out of luck, unless Tom makes a new promise to pay \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n339 \nor actually pays part of the debt. (However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES",

For example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing was binding, \nwhether or not there was consideration in our sense. Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of \ngifts were made binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the United States. And in \nthe Anglo-American tradition, the presence of a seal was once sufficient to make a contract binding \nwithout any other consideration.

The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor.

Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment.

Still, although there are \nnumerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out \ntheir contracts, the courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous \nline that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it.” By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the \npromisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, \nthough not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an \nincentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay. The purpose of \ncontract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to \nput the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach. \n \nCompensatory Damages \nOne party has the right to damages (money ) when the other party has breached the contract unless, of \ncourse, the contract itself or other circumstances suspend or discharge that \nright. Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing",

Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are \ncharges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees. California has been the leader among \nthe state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints \nthat the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless \ncompanies. Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of \ncontract. \n \nSpecific Performance \nSpecific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which \nhe obligated himself in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be \nissued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is seeking \nenforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from \ndoing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate \nremedy.) Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental \nvalue because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while still \nexecutory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily. Specific \nperformance is an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach of contract to sell a unique \nitem (real estate is always unique). \n \nRestitution \nAs the word implies, restitution is a restoring to one party of what he gave to the other.

Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom’s restitution \ninterest is $100. But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance. The courts \nhave considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the \ninjured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the \nproperty of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance. Mellors, a gardener, agrees to \nconstruct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500. After erecting \nthree, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased \nthe value of the Lady’s grounds by $800. If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s \nrestitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would \nhave cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends on who \nrepudiated the contract and for what reason. \n \nTort vs. Contract Remedies \nFrequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious conduct. A physician warrants her treatment as \nperfectly safe but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient for life. The patient could sue \nfor malpractice (tort) or for breach of warranty (contract). The choice involves at least four \nconsiderations: \n1. Statute of limitations. Most statutes of limitations prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort \nactions. \n2. Allowable damages. Punitive damages are more often permitted in tort actions, and certain kinds of \ninjuries are compensable in tort but not in contract suits—for example, pain and suffering. \n3. Expert testimony. In most cases, the use of experts would be the same in either tort or contract suits, \nbut in certain contract cases, the expert witness could be dispensed with, as, for example, in a contract \ncase charging that the physician abandoned the patient. \n4. Insurance coverage. Most policies do not cover intentional torts, so a contract theory that avoids the \nelement of willfulness would provide the plaintiff with a surer chance of recovering money damages. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n355",

Understand how the agency relationship is created. \n \n \nIntroduction to Agency Law \nWhy Is Agency Law Important, and What Is an Agent? \nAn agent is a person who acts in the name of and on behalf of another, having been given and assumed \nsome degree of authority to do so. Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—\nis carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships \nand other business organizations rely extensively on agents to conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each \npartner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the \ncorporation. \n \nThe existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature. He is said to \nhave been the first person from the Mayflower to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620; he was a carpenter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n372 \na cooper (barrel maker), and a diplomat. His agency task—of interest here—was celebrated in Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow’s “The Courtship of Miles Standish.” He was to woo Priscilla Mullins (d. 1680), \n“the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,” on behalf of Captain Miles Standish, a valiant soldier who was too shy \nto propose marriage. Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady.

These relationships can be summed up in a simple \ndiagram (see Figure 9.1 \"Agency Relationships\"). \n \nFigure 9.1 Agency Relationships \n \n \nIn this chapter, we will consider the principal-agent side of the triangle. In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer",

Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not",

It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent. There are, however, a few situations in which \nthe capacity of the agent is important. Thus a mentally incompetent agent cannot bind a principal. \n \nAgency Created by Operation of Law \nMost agencies are made by contract, but agency also may arise impliedly or apparently. \n \nImplied Agency",

Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause \nin the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several \naspects. \n \nDuty to Avoid Self-Dealing \nA fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his \nprincipal’s interest in that same transaction. A broker hired as a purchasing agent, for instance, may not \nsell to his principal through a company in which he or his family has a financial interest.

Such information could \neasily be turned to the disadvantage of the principal if the agent were to compete with the principal or \nwere to sell the information to those who do.

Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence.

Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31.

Courts are apt to be liberal in construing statutes to include \nthose who might not seem to be employed. InBetts v. Ann Arbor Public Schools, a University of \nMichigan student majoring in physical education was a student teacher in a junior high \nschool. [7] During a four-month period, he taught two physical education courses. On the last day \nof his student teaching, he walked into the locker room and thirty of his students grabbed him \nand tossed him into the swimming pool. This was traditional, but he “didn’t feel like going in that \nmorning” and put up a struggle that ended with a whistle on an elastic band hitting him in the \neye, which he subsequently lost as a result of the injury. He filed a workers’ compensation claim. \nThe school board argued that he could not be classified as an employee because he received no \npay. Since he was injured by students—not considered agents of the school—he would probably \nhave been unsuccessful in filing a tort suit; hence the workers’ compensation claim was his only \nchance of recompense. The state workers’ compensation appeal board ruled against the school on \nthe ground that payment in money was not required: “Plaintiff was paid in the form of training, \ncollege credits towards graduation, and meeting of the prerequisites of a state provisional \ncertificate.” The state supreme court affirmed the award. \n• \nHow palpable must the “injury” be? A difficult issue is whether a worker is entitled to \ncompensation for psychological injury, including cumulative trauma. Until the 1970s, insurance \ncompanies and compensation boards required physical injury before making an award. Claims \nthat job stresses led to nervous breakdowns or other mental disorders were rejected. But most \ncourts have liberalized the definition of injury and now recognize that psychological trauma can \nbe real and that job stress can bring it on, as shown by the discussion of Wolfe v.

However, the judge made an express finding to that \neffect: ‘* * * there was sufficient evidence in plaintiff’s case on which to find DiGiovanni, the man in the \nuniform, was acting within the scope of his authority as agent of defendant.” Defendant here also points to \nthe fact that in Klotz DiGiovanni placed patrons’ car keys on a rack inside El Morocco; however, this is \nonly one fact to be considered in finding a bailment and is, to me, more relevant to the issue of the degree \nof care exercised. \n \nWhen defendant’s agent failed to produce plaintiff’s automobile, a presumption of negligence arose which \nnow requires defendant to come forward with a sufficient explanation to rebut this presumption. \n[Citation] The matter should be set down for trial on the issues of due care and of damages. \n \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n398 \n1.

Because Microsoft required that they work on site, they received admittance card keys, \noffice equipment and supplies from the company. \n \nFreelancers and regular employees, however, were not without their obvious distinctions.

It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays.

First, as noted in the \npsychiatric testimony there is nothing in the nature of a stress or shock situation which ordains physical \nas opposed to psychological injury. The determinative factor is the particular vulnerability of an individual \nby virtue of his physical makeup. In a given situation one person may be susceptible to a heart attack \nwhile another may suffer a depressive reaction.

The law recognizes several types of agents, including (1) the \ngeneral agent, one who possesses authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name of and \non behalf of the principal; (2) the special agent, one with authority to act only in a specifically designated \ninstance or set of transactions; (3) the agent whose agency is coupled with an interest, one who has a \nproperty interest in addition to authority to act as an agent; (4) the subagent, one appointed by an agent \nwith authority to do so; and (5) the servant (“employee” in modern English), one whose physical conduct \nis subject to control of the principal. \n \nA servant should be distinguished from an independent contractor, whose work is not subject to the \ncontrol of the principal. The difference is important for purposes of taxation, workers’ compensation, and \nliability insurance.",

If express authority were the only valid kind, there would be no efficient way to use an agent, \nboth because the effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the third party would be \nreluctant to deal with him. \nBut the law permits authority to be “implied” by the relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of \nthe business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question, the wording of the agency contract, and \nthe knowledge that the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it. In \neither event, the business manager has a relatively large domain of implied authority. He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business. The full extent of the manager’s authority \ndepends on the circumstances—what is customary in the particular industry, in the particular business, \nand among the individuals directly concerned. \n \nOn the other hand, a manager does not have implicit authority to undertake unusual or extraordinary \nactions on behalf of his principal. In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a \nnew logo for the hotel’s stationery.

What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel.

This is particularly important in business situations where the principal may not have the time or resources to carry out all tasks themselves, and where it is necessary to delegate authority to agents who can act on the principal's behalf. Additionally, implied authority can help to ensure that the principal's interests are protected and that the agents are acting in accordance with the principal's wishes.

If the principal directed the agent to commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the \nagent’s carrying out his instructions would bring harm to someone, the principal is liable. This is an \napplication of the general common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by delegating an \nunlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls \nthe trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in his use of agents will be held liable for their \nnegligence. This rule comes into play when the principal fails to supervise employees adequately, gives \nfaulty directions, or hires incompetent or unsuitable people for a particular job. Imposing liability on the \nprincipal in these cases is readily justifiable since it is the principal’s own conduct that is the underlying \nfault; the principal here is directly liable. \n \nVicarious Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n424 \nBut the principle of liability for one’s agent is much broader, extending to acts of which the principal had \nno knowledge, that he had no intention to commit nor involvement in, and that he may in fact have \nexpressly prohibited the agent from engaging in. This is the principle of respondeat superior (“let the \nmaster answer”) or the master-servant doctrine, which imposes on the \nprincipal vicarious liability (vicarious means “indirectly, as, by, or through a substitute”) under which \nthe principal is responsible for acts committed by the agent within the scope of the employment \n(see Figure 10.2 \"Principal’s Tort Liability\"). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10.2 Principal’s Tort Liability \n \n \nThe modern basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed the “deep pocket” theory: the principal \n(usually a corporation) has deeper pockets than the agent, meaning that it has the wherewithal to pay for",

The thought was that one could never infer authority to \ncommit a willfully wrongful act. Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal if the \nagent is acting to further the principal’s business. See the very disturbing Lyon v. Carey in Section 10.4.2 \n\"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: Scope of Employment\". \nDeviations from Employment \nThe general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if the servant committed them “in the scope of \nemployment.” But determining what this means is not easy. \n \nThe “Scope of Employment” Problem \nIt may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent of another. But a principal cannot be \nresponsible for every act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of his instructions, it will be \neasy to determine liability. But suppose an agent deviates in some way from his job. The classic test of \nliability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison.

The driver was the employee of another, and inside was a fellow employee. \nThere was no question that the driver had acted carelessly, but what he and his fellow employee were \ndoing on the road where the plaintiff was injured was disputed. For weeks before and after the accident, \nthe cart had never been driven in the vicinity in which the plaintiff was walking, nor did it have any \nbusiness there. The suggestion was that the employees might have gone out of their way for their own \npurposes. As the great English jurist Baron Parke put it, “If the servants, being on their master’s business, \ntook a detour to call upon a friend, the master will be responsible.…But if he was going on a frolic of his \nown, without being at all on his master’s business, the master will not be liable.” In applying this test, the \ncourt held the employer liable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n427 \nThe test is thus one of degree, and it is not always easy to decide when a detour has become so great as to \nbe transformed into a frolic. For a time, a rather mechanical rule was invoked to aid in making the \ndecision. The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply. If a hungry deliveryman stops at a restaurant outside the normal \nlunch hour, intending to continue to his next delivery after eating, he is within the scope of employment. \nBut suppose he decides to take the truck home that evening, in violation of rules, in order to get an early \nstart the next morning.

By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test.

Is the owner liable? In many states, the \nowner is not liable; in other states, however, two approaches impose liability on the owner. \nThe first approach is legislative: owner’s consent statutes make the owner liable when the automobile \nis being driven with his consent or knowledge. The second approach to placing liability on the owner is \njudicial and known as the family purpose doctrine. Under this doctrine, a family member who \nnegligently injures someone with the car subjects the owner to liability if the family member was \nfurthering family purposes. These are loosely defined to include virtually every use to which a child, for \nexample, might put a car. In a Georgia case, Dixon v.

[2] Nevertheless, the son gave the wheel \nto a friend and a collision occurred while both were in the car. The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction \n(to which Mr. Dickens’s Mr. Bumble responded, in the memorable line, “If the law supposes that, the law \nis a ass—a idiot” [4]). This ancient view has been abrogated by statute or by court ruling in all the states, so \nthat now a wife is solely responsible for her own torts unless she in fact serves as her husband’s agent. \n \nUnlike wives, children are not presumed at common law to be agents or extensions of the father so that \nnormally parents are not vicariously liable for their children’s torts. However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers. Thus the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n429 \nIllinois Parental Responsibility Law provides the following: “The parent or legal guardian of an \nunemancipated minor who resides with such parent or legal guardian is liable for actual damages for the \nwillful or malicious acts of such minor which cause injury to a person or property.” [5] Several other states \nimpose a monetary limit on such liability. \n \nOther Torts Governed by Statute or Regulation \nThere are certain types of conduct that statutes or regulation attempt to control by placing the burden of \nliability on those presumably in a position to prevent the unwanted conduct.

In addition, a number of states have passed statutes making parents liable for the torts of their children. In most states, the parent is liable for the willful or malicious torts of the child. In addition, in some states, parents are liable for the torts of their children if the parents have reason to know that the child is a danger to others.

Another example involves the \nsale of adulterated or short-weight foodstuffs: the employer of one who sells such may be liable, even if \nthe employer did not know of the sales. \n \nPrincipal’s Criminal Liability \nAs a general proposition, a principal will not be held liable for an agent’s unauthorized criminal acts if the \ncrimes are those requiring specific intent. Thus a department store proprietor who tells his chief buyer to \nget the “best deal possible” on next fall’s fashions is not liable if the buyer steals clothes from the \nmanufacturer.

Recognize the ways the agency relationship is terminated. \n \n \nAgent’s Personal Liability for Torts and Contracts \nTort Liability \nThat a principal is held vicariously liable and must pay damages to an injured third person does not \nexcuse the agent who actually committed the tortious acts. A person is always liable for his or her own \ntorts (unless the person is insane, involuntarily intoxicated, or acting under extreme duress). The agent is \npersonally liable for his wrongful acts and must reimburse the principal for any damages the principal was \nforced to pay, as long as the principal did not authorize the wrongful conduct. The agent directed to \ncommit a tort remains liable for his own conduct but is not obliged to repay the principal. Liability as an \nagent can be burdensome, sometimes perhaps more burdensome than as a principal. The latter normally \npurchases insurance to cover against wrongful acts of agents, but liability insurance policies frequently do \nnot cover the employee’s personal liability if the employee is named in a lawsuit individually. Thus \ndoctors’ and hospitals’ malpractice policies protect a doctor from both her own mistakes and those of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n432 \nnurses and others that the doctor would be responsible for; nurses, however, might need their own \ncoverage. In the absence of insurance, an agent is at serious risk in this lawsuit-conscious age. The risk is \nnot total. The agent is not liable for torts of other agents unless he is personally at fault—for example, by \nnegligently supervising a junior or by giving faulty instructions. For example, an agent, the general \nmanager for a principal, hires Brown as a subordinate. Brown is competent to do the job but by failing to \nexercise proper control over a machine negligently injures Ted, a visitor to the premises. The principal \nand Brown are liable to Ted, but the agent is not. \n \nContract Liability \nIt makes sense that an agent should be liable for her own torts; it would be a bad social policy indeed if a \nperson could escape tort liability based on her own fault merely because she acted in an agency capacity.

Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable.

A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a",

Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal.

                    "answer": "Both the developer and the agents are liable. That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there was a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may still recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior to winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the plaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway. Similarly, if the seller sues the principal and recovers a judgment, the agents are relieved of liability. The seller thus has a “right of election” to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, a right that in many states may be exercised any time before the seller collects on the judgment."

But the \nagent does not warrant that the principal has capacity. Thus an agent for a minor is not liable on a \ncontract that the minor later disavows unless the agent expressly warranted that the principal had \nattained his majority. In short, the implied warranty is that the agent has authority to make a deal, not \nthat the principal will necessarily comply with the contract once the deal is made. \n \nAgent Acting on Own Account \nAn agent will be liable on contracts made in a personal capacity—for instance, when the agent personally \nguarantees repayment of a debt. The agent’s intention to be personally liable is often difficult to determine \non the basis of his signature on a contract. Generally, a person signing a contract can avoid personal \nliability only by showing that he was in fact signing as an agent. If the contract is signed “Jones, Agent,” \nJones can introduce evidence to show that there was never an intention to hold him personally liable. But \nif he signed “Jones” and neither his agency nor the principal’s name is included, he will be personally \nliable. This can be troublesome to agents who routinely indorse checks and notes. There are special rules \ngoverning these situations, which are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\" dealing with \ncommercial paper. \n \nTermination of Agency \nThe agency relationship is not permanent. Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the \nend of three months” or “on midnight, December 31”). An agreement may also terminate on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n435 \naccomplishment of a specified act (“on the sale of the house”) or following a specific event (“at the \nconclusion of the last horse race”). \n \nMutual consent between the parties will end the agency.

Brown’s status as executive vice-president \nwas not, therefore, a badge of apparent authority to modify agreements to which the Bank was a party. \n \nTrappings of office, e.g., office and furnishing, private secretary, while they may have some tendency to \nsuggest executive responsibility, do not without other evidence provide a basis for finding apparent \nauthority. Apparent authority is drawn from a variety of circumstances. Thus in Federal Nat.

Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order.

Similarly, to sue a partnership, the plaintiff must name and sue each of the \npartners. This cumbersome procedure was modified in many states, which enacted special statutes \nexpressly permitting suits by and against partnerships in the firm name. In suits on a claim in federal \ncourt, a partnership may sue and be sued in its common name. The move by RUPA to make partnerships \nentities changed very little. Certainly it provides that “a partnership may sue and be sued in the name of \nthe partnership”—that’s handy where the plaintiff hopes for a judgment against the partnership, without \nrecourse to the individual partners’ personal assets. [6] But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and \nthe partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment \nagainst a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating \nthat partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in \npartnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership. [8] Under RUPA, \n“property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.” [9] But RUPA \nis no different from UPA in practical effect.

The latter provides that “property originally brought into the \npartnership stock or subsequently acquired by purchase…on account of the partnership, is partnership \nproperty.” [10] Under either law, a partner may bring onto the partnership premises her own property, not \nacquired in the name of the partnership or with its credit, and it remains her separate property.

Partnership law goes back a long way, but in \nthe United States, most states—but not all—have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA, 1997) \nover the previous Uniform Partnership Act, originally promulgated in 1914. One salient change made by RUPA \nis to directly announce that a partnership is an entity: it is like a person for purposes of accounting, litigation, \nbankruptcy, and owning real estate. Partnerships do not pay taxes; the individual partners do. But in practical \nterms, what RUPA does is codify already-existing state law on these matters, and partners are free to organize \ntheir relationship as they like in the partnership agreement. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to \ncomply with the statute, it could find that it will be unable to file suit to enforce its contracts. \nCreation of Implied Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n466 \nAn implied partnership exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on a business as co-\nowners for profit.

Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important.

But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business.

The latter has been adopted by thirty-five states. At common law, a partnership was not a legal entity \nand could not sue or be sued in the partnership name. Partnership law defines a partnership as “an \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.” The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) assumes that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals, but it also applies a \nnumber of rules characteristic of the legal entity theory. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) \nassumes a partnership is an entity, but it applies one crucial rule characteristic of the aggregate theory: \nthe partners are ultimately liable for the partnership’s obligations. Thus a partnership may keep business \nrecords as if it were a legal entity, may hold real estate in the partnership name, and may sue and be sued \nin federal court and in many state courts in the partnership name. \n \nPartnerships may be created informally. Among the clues to the existence of a partnership are (1) co-\nownership of a business, (2) sharing of profits, (3) right to participate in decision making, (4) duty to \nshare liabilities, and (5) manner in which the business is operated. A partnership may also be formed by \nimplication; it may be formed by estoppel when a third party reasonably relies on a representation that a \npartnership in fact exists. \nNo special rules govern the partnership agreement. As a practical matter, it should sufficiently spell out \nwho the partners are, under what name they will conduct their business, the nature and scope of the \nbusiness, capital contributions of each partner, how profits are to be divided, and similar pertinent \nprovisions. An oral agreement to form a partnership is valid unless the business cannot be performed \nwholly within one year from the time that the agreement is made. However, most partnerships have no \nfixed terms and hence are “at-will” partnerships not subject to the Statute of Frauds. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n488",

Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”?

Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners. Even after winning a judgment, the plaintiff may \nsue other partners unnamed in the original action. Each and every partner is separately liable for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n509 \nentire amount of the debt, although the plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than the total of his \ndamages.

All partners are also liable for any partner’s tort \ncommitted in the scope of partnership business under agency law, and this liability is—again—personal \nand unlimited, subject to RUPA’s requirement that the judgment creditor exhaust the partnership’s assets \nbefore going after the separate assets of the partners.

When guilty intent is not an element, as in certain \nregulatory offenses, all partners may be guilty of an act committed by a partner in the course of the \nbusiness. \n \nLiability for Taxes \nCorporate income gets taxed twice under federal law: once to the corporation and again to the \nshareholders who receive income as dividends. However, the partnership’s income “passes through” the \npartnership and is distributed to the partners under the conduit theory. When partners get income \nfrom the firm they have to pay tax on it, but the partnership pays no tax (it files an information return). \nThis is perceived to be a significant advantage of the partnership form. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n510 \n \nThe partnership is generally liable for any contract made by a partner with authority express, implied, or \napparent.

Explain the winding up of partnerships under UPA and RUPA. \n \n \nIt is said that a partnership is like a marriage, and that extends to its ending too. It’s easier to get into a \npartnership than it is to get out of it because legal entanglements continue after a person is no longer a \npartner. The rules governing “getting out” of a partnership are different under the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) than under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). We take up UPA first. \n \nDissolution of Partnerships under UPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n512 \nDissolution, in the most general sense, means a separation into component parts. \n \nMeaning of Dissolution under UPA \nPeople in business are sometimes confused about the meaning of dissolution. It does not mean the \ntermination of a business. It has a precise legal definition, given in UPA Section 29: “The dissolution of a \npartnership is the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in \nthe carrying on as distinguished from the winding up of the business.” The partnership is not necessarily \nterminated on dissolution; rather, it continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed, \nand the remaining partners may choose to continue on as a new partnership if they want. [1] But, again, \nunder UPA the partnership dissolves upon the withdrawal of any partner. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nPartnerships can dissolve for a number of reasons. [2] \n \nIn Accordance with the Agreement \nThe term of the partnership agreement may have expired or the partnership may be at will and one of the \npartners desires to leave it.

Or a partner may die or one or more partners or the entire \npartnership may become bankrupt. Dissolution under these circumstances is said to be by operation of \nlaw. [3] \n \nBy Court Order \nFinally, dissolution may be by court order. Courts are empowered to dissolve partnerships when “on \napplication by or for a partner” a partner is shown to be a lunatic, of unsound mind, incapable of \nperforming his part of the agreement, “guilty of such conduct as tends to affect prejudicially the carrying \non of the business,” or otherwise behaves in such a way that “it is not reasonably practicable to carry on \nthe business in partnership with him.” A court may also order dissolution if the business can only be \ncarried on at a loss or whenever equitable. In some circumstances, a court will order dissolution upon the \napplication of a purchaser of a partner’s interest. [4] \n \nEffect of Dissolution on Authority \nFor the most part, dissolution terminates the authority of the partners to act for the partnership. The only \nsignificant exceptions are for acts necessary to wind up partnership affairs or to complete transactions \nbegun but not finished at the time of dissolution. [5] Notwithstanding the latter exception, no partner can \nbind the partnership if it has dissolved because it has become unlawful to carry on the business or if the \npartner seeking to exercise authority has become bankrupt. \n \nAfter Dissolution",

It explores several \ntypes of associations that are hybrid forms—that is, they share some aspects of partnerships and \nsome of corporations. Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability, partnerships \nthe inestimable benefit of limited taxation. Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their \ntaxation. \n \nAt base, whether to allow businesspeople and investors to grasp the holy grail of limited liability is a \npolitical issue. When we say a person is “irresponsible,” it means he (or she, or it) does not take \nresponsibility for his harmful actions; the loss is borne by others. Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment. So the political trade-off \nwith allowing various inventive forms of business organization is between providing business actors \nwith the security that they will lose only their calculable investment, thus stimulating the economy,",

An LLC is a separate legal entity from its owners, which means that the owners are not personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the LLC. The LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, which means that the income and losses of the LLC are passed through to the owners and reported on their personal tax returns. The owners of an LLC are called members, and they may be individuals, corporations, or other entities. The members of an LLC are not required to be actively involved in the management of the business, and they may be passive investors. The management of an LLC is typically handled by a board of directors, who are elected by the members. The LLC may also have a manager, who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business. The LLC is a flexible business structure that can be tailored to meet the needs of the business and its owners.

This can result in lower taxes for the owners. An LLC is also a flexible business structure. It can be tailored to meet the needs of the business and its owners.

Upon dissolution, actual authority of members or managers terminates except as \nneeded to wind up; members may have apparent authority, though, unless the third party had notice of \nthe dissolution. \n \nFree Transferability of Interest \nAgain, the problem here is that if a member’s interest in the LLC is as freely transferable as a \nshareholder’s interest in a corporation (an owner can transfer all attributes of his interest without the \nothers’ consent), the LLC will probably be said to have a check mark in the “corporate-like” box: too many \nof those and the firm will not be allowed pass-through taxation. Thus the trick for the LLC promoters is to \nlimit free transferability enough to pass the test of not being a corporation, but not limit so much as to \nmake it really difficult to divest oneself of the interest (then it’s not a very liquid or desirable investment). \n \nSome states’ LLC statutes have as the default rule that the remaining members must unanimously consent \nto allow an assignee or a transferee of a membership interest to participate in managing the LLC. Since \nthis prevents a member from transferring all attributes of the interest (the right to participate in \nmanagement isn’t transferred or assigned), the LLC formed under the default provision will not have “free \ntransferability of interest.” But if the LLC agreement allows majority consent for the transfer of all \nattributes, that also would satisfy the requirement that there not be free transferability of interests.

LLCs are popular among small business owners because they offer limited liability protection while still allowing for the flexibility and pass-through taxation of a partnership. The owners of an LLC are called members, and the management of the LLC is typically handled by the members or by managers appointed by the members. The LLC structure is governed by state law and is typically formed by filing articles of organization with the state in which the LLC will do business."

LLCs are popular among small business owners because they offer limited liability protection while still allowing for the flexibility and pass-through taxation of a partnership. In contrast, corporations are more complex and costly to form and maintain. They also require more formalities and procedures, such as holding annual meetings and maintaining detailed records. Additionally, corporations are subject to double taxation, while LLCs are not."

(emphasis in original) \n \nWhile italicizing the phases that appear to suit his purposes, the plaintiff completely ignores the most \nimportant phrase: “a partner in a registered limited liability partnership.” At the hearing, neither party \npresented any evidence at the hearing that tended to prove that the nature of the business relationship \nbetween the parties was that of a “registered limited liability partnership.” To the contrary, the testimony \npresented at the hearing revealed that the parties had a general partnership in which they had orally \nagreed to share profits and losses equally and that they never signed a partnership agreement.

The general \npartner controls the firm and is liable like a partner in a general partnership (except under ULPA-2001 \nliability is limited); the limited partners are investors and have little say in the daily operations of the \nfirm.

The general partner, though, can be a corporation, which finesses the liability problem. A limited \npartnership comes into existence only when a certificate of limited partnership is filed with the state. \n \nIn the mid-twentieth century, Congress was importuned to allow small corporations the benefit of pass-\nthrough taxation. It created the sub-S corporation (referring to a section of the IRS code). It affords the \nbenefits of taxation like a partnership and limited liability for its members, but there are several \ninconvenient limitations on how sub-S corporations can be set up and operate. \n \nThe 1990s saw the limited liability company become the entity of choice for many businesspeople. It deftly \ncombines limited liability for all owners—managers and nonmanagers—with pass-through taxation and \nhas none of the restrictions perceived to hobble the sub-S corporate form. Careful crafting of the firm’s \nbylaws and operating certificate allow it to combine the best of all possible business forms. There \nremained, though, one fly in the ointment: most states did not allow professionals to form limited liability \ncompanies (LLCs). \n \nThis last barrier was hurtled with the development of the limited liability partnership. This form, though \nmostly governed by partnership law, eschews the vicarious liability of nonacting partners for another’s \ntorts, malpractice, or partnership breaches of contract. The extent to which such exoneration from \nliability presents a moral hazard—allowing bad actors to escape their just liability—is a matter of concern. \n \nHaving polished off liability for all owners with the LLC and the LLP, the next logical step occurred when \neyes returned to the venerable limited partnership. The invention of the limited liability limited \npartnership in ULPA-2001 not only abolished the “control test” that made limited partners liable if they \ngot too involved in the firm’s operations but also eliminated the general partner’s liability. \n \nTable 13.1 Comparison of Business Organization Forms",

Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589",

By contrast, \nownership and control of corporations are, in theory, separated. In the publicly held corporation, \nwhich has many shareholders, the separation is real. Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of \nshares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of \nstock.

Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of shares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of stock. It is difficult under the best of circumstances for shareholders to exert any form of control over corporate operations. However, in the closely held corporation, which has few shareholders, the officers or senior managers are usually also the shareholders, so the separation of ownership and control may be less pronounced or even nonexistent."

Its president, one of the company’s largest creditors and \nalso virtually its sole owner, instigated the fire. The corporation sued the insurance company to recover \nthe amount for which it was insured. According to the court in the Felsenthal case, “The general rule of \nlaw is that the willful burning of property by a stockholder in a corporation is not a defense against the \ncollection of the insurance by the corporation, and…the corporation cannot be prevented from collecting \nthe insurance because its agents willfully set fire to the property without the participation or authority of \nthe corporation or of all of the stockholders of the corporation.” [3] But because the fire was caused by the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n596 \nbeneficial owner of “practically all” the stock, who also “has the absolute management of [the \ncorporation’s] affairs and its property, and is its president,” the court refused to allow the company to \nrecover the insurance money; allowing the company to recover would reward fraud. [4] \n \nFailure to Act as a Corporation \nIn other limited circumstances, individual stockholders may also be found personally liable. Failure to \nfollow corporate formalities, for example, may subject stockholders to personal liability. This is a \nspecial risk that small, especially one-person, corporations run. Particular factors that bring this rule into \nplay include inadequate capitalization, omission of regular meetings, failure to record minutes of \nmeetings, failure to file annual reports, and commingling of corporate and personal assets. Where these \nfactors exist, the courts may look through the corporate veil and pluck out the individual stockholder or \nstockholders to answer for a tort, contract breach, or the like. The classic case is the taxicab operator who \nincorporates several of his cabs separately and services them through still another corporation. If one of \nthe cabs causes an accident, the corporation is usually “judgment proof” because the corporation will have \nfew assets (practically worthless cab, minimum insurance).

The question of whether corporations should have rights similar to those of natural persons is a complex one, and there are many different viewpoints on the issue.  Some people believe that corporations should have the same rights as natural persons because they are legal entities that can enter into contracts, own property, and conduct business.  Others argue that corporations should not have the same rights as natural persons because they are not human beings and therefore cannot experience the same types of feelings and emotions.  Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to grant corporations the same rights as natural persons is up to the individual state governments.  Some states have granted corporations certain rights, while others have not.  It is important to note that even if a corporation is granted the same rights as a natural person, it does not mean that it will automatically have the same privileges.  For example, a corporation may have the right to free speech, but it does not necessarily have the same right to freedom of religion as a natural person.  In general, it is generally agreed that corporations should not have the same rights as natural persons in areas such as voting and freedom of speech.  However, there is less agreement on whether corporations should have the same rights as natural persons in areas such as property ownership and contract enforcement.  Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to grant corporations the same rights as natural persons is a complex one that will likely continue to be debated for many years to come."

The board of directors is responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of the corporation, and they are required to do so without regard to their own personal interests.  Another way to speak the “corporate mind” is through the use of a corporate charter.  The corporate charter is a document that outlines the purpose and powers of the corporation.

Insider trading is the practice of buying or selling securities based on material nonpublic information. In this case, the president and majority stockholder had material nonpublic information about the company’s financial condition that he did not disclose to the other stockholders. By selling his shares before the other stockholders, he was able to profit from the information.

Under the federal income tax laws \nthen in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed.

The term used for the \ndocument varies from state to state. Most states call the basic document filed in the appropriate public \noffice the “articles of incorporation” or “certificate of incorporation,” but there are other variations. There \nis no legal significance to these differences in terminology. \n \nChartering is basically a state prerogative. Congress has chartered several enterprises, including national \nbanks (under the National Banking Act), federal savings and loan associations, national farm loan \nassociations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted.

The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure.

Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed.

When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily.

The rationale for corporation by estoppel is that the state's corporate laws are designed to protect the public, and that a corporation that is formed in accordance with the state's corporate laws is more likely to be a legitimate and responsible business entity. In order for a court to recognize a corporation by estoppel, the corporation must have been formed with the intent to create a legal entity, and must have been treated as a legal entity by the public. The court will also consider the extent to which the corporation has been recognized as a legal entity by other parties, such as creditors and customers."

In appellants’ \nview, the enactment of a graduated personal income tax, as proposed to be authorized by constitutional \namendment, would have a seriously adverse effect on the economy of the State. The importance of the \nreferendum issue to the people and government of Massachusetts is not disputed.

The “materially affecting” requirement is not an identification \nof the boundaries of corporate speech etched by the Constitution itself. Rather, it amounts to an \nimpermissible legislative prohibition of speech based on the identity of the interests that spokesmen may \nrepresent in public debate over controversial issues and a requirement that the speaker have a sufficiently \ngreat interest in the subject to justify communication. \n \nSection 8 permits a corporation to communicate to the public its views on certain referendum subjects—\nthose materially affecting its business—but not others. It also singles out one kind of ballot question—\nindividual taxation as a subject about which corporations may never make their ideas public. The \nlegislature has drawn the line between permissible and impermissible speech according to whether there \nis a sufficient nexus, as defined by the legislature, between the issue presented to the voters and the \nbusiness interests of the speaker. \n \nIn the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects \nabout which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue. If a legislature may \ndirect business corporations to “stick to business,” it also may limit other corporations—religious, \ncharitable, or civic—to their respective “business” when addressing the public.

Towards this purpose he met with other interested individuals \nand an attorney and agreed to purchase stock and become an officer and director. Thereafter, upon being \nadvised by the attorney that the corporation had been formed under the laws of Maryland, he paid for and \nreceived a stock certificate evidencing ownership of shares in the corporation, and was shown the \ncorporate seal and minute book. The business of the new venture was conducted as if it were a \ncorporation, through corporate bank accounts, with auditors maintaining corporate books and records, \nand under a lease entered into by the corporation for the office from which it operated its business. \nCranson was elected president and all transactions conducted by him for the corporation, including the \ndealings with I.B.M., were made as an officer of the corporation. At no time did he assume any personal \nobligation or pledge his individual credit to I.B.M.

This is covered \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual \nLiens\". A common type of corporate debt security is a bond, which is a promise to repay the face value of \nthe bond at maturity and make periodic interest payments called the coupon rate. For example, a bond \nmay have a face value of $1,000 (the amount to be repaid at maturity) and a coupon rate of 7 percent paid \nannually; the corporation pays $70 interest on such a bond each year. Bondholders have priority over \nstockholders because a bond is a debt, and in the event of bankruptcy, creditors have priority over equity \nholders. \n \nEquity Securities \nThe third source of new capital funds is equity securities—namely, stock. Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business. Stock is the smallest source of new capital but is of critical importance to the \ncorporation in launching the business and its initial operations. Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration. Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do \nnot want to avail themselves of these financing options. Instead, they seek to raise funds through \nprivate equity, which involves private investors providing funds to a company in exchange for an \ninterest in the company.

Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups. Generally, private equity firms that provide a lot \nof venture capital must be extremely savvy about the start-up plans of new businesses and must ask the \nstart-up entrepreneurs numerous challenging and pertinent questions. Such private equity firms expect a \nhigher rate of return on their investment than would be available from established companies. Today, \nventure capital is often used to finance entrepreneurial start-ups in biotechnology and clean technology. \n \nSometimes, a private equity firm will buy all the publicly traded shares of a company—a process \ncommonly termed “going private.” Private equity may also be involved in providing financing to \nestablished firms. \n \nAnother source of private equity is angel investors, affluent individuals who operate like venture \ncapitalists, providing capital for a business to get started in exchange for repayment with interest or an \nownership interest. The main difference between an angel investor and a venture capitalist is the source of \nfunds: an angel investor invests his or her own money, while venture capitalists use pooled funds. \n \nPrivate equity firms may also use a leveraged buyout (LBO) to finance the acquisition of another firm. \nDiscussed further in Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign \nCorporations, and Corporate Dissolution\" on Corporate Expansion, in the realm of private equity, an LBO \nis a financing option using debt to acquire another firm. In an LBO, private equity investors use the assets \nof the target corporation as collateral for a loan to purchase that target corporation. Such investors may \npursue an LBO as a debt acquisition option since they do not need to use much—or even any—of their own \nmoney in order to finance the acquisition. \n \nA major drawback to private equity, whether through a firm or through venture capital, is the risk versus \nreturn trade-off.

This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond.

There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy.

Bonds are a popular investment option for many investors because they offer a fixed rate of return and are considered to be relatively low-risk. However, there are also some disadvantages to investing in bonds. For example, bonds are not as liquid as other investments, such as stocks, which can make it difficult to sell them quickly if you need to. Additionally, if interest rates rise, the value of your bond may decline."

                    "answer": "A bond is a type of debt security, while a stock is a type of equity security. Bonds are issued by corporations, governments, and other entities to raise money. In return for the loan, the issuer promises to pay the investors back, with interest, on a specific date (the maturity date). Stocks, on the other hand, represent ownership in a company. When you buy stock, you become a part-owner of the company and are entitled to a share of the company's profits (in the form of dividends) and a share of the company's assets (in the event of bankruptcy)."

            "chunk": "A key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. In \nbankruptcy, the bondholders have a liquidation preference over investors with ownership—that is, the \nshareholders. Additionally, being highly leveraged can be risky: a corporation could load itself up with too \nmuch debt and not be able to make its interest payments or face-value payments. Another major \nconsideration is the “cost” of debt. When interest rates are high, corporations must offer higher interest \nrates to attract investors. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations often raise capital and finance operations through debt. Bank loans are one source of debt, but \nlarge corporations often turn to bonds for financing. Bonds are an IOU, whereby the corporation sells a bond \nto an investor; agrees to make periodic interest payments, such as 5 percent of the face value of the bond \nannually; and at the maturity date, pays the face value of the bond to the investor. There are several \nadvantages to the corporation in using bonds as a financial instrument: the corporation does not give up \nownership in the firm, it attracts more investors, it increases its flexibility, and it can deduct the interest \npayments from corporate taxes. Bonds do have some disadvantages: they are debt and can hurt a highly \nleveraged company, the corporation must pay the interest and principal when they are due, and the \nbondholders have a preference over shareholders upon liquidation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

However, preferred stock \nusually has a par value, which is useful in determining dividend and liquidation rights. \n \nThe term stated capital describes the sum of the par value of the issued par value stock and the \nconsideration received (or stated value) for the no-par stock. The excess of net assets of a corporation over \nstated capital is its surplus.

Holders of preferred stock must look to the articles of \nincorporation to find out what their rights are. Preferred stock has elements of both stock (equity) and \nbonds (debt).

Alternatively, the corporation may force a \nconversion of a shareholder’s convertible stock. Thus if permitted, a preferred shareholder may convert \nhis or her preferred shares into common stock, or vice versa. The exception bars conversion of stock into a \nclass with an asset liquidation preference, although some states permit even that type of so-called \nupstream conversion to a senior security.

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash.

Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash.

Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v.

The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation.

The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the \ndefinition in the 1933 and 1934 acts. Thus a security may be governed by the securities acts but not by the \nUCC. The definition of a private placement of securities also differs between the UCC and the securities \nacts. Other differences exist. [2] The UCC, as well as state-specific laws, and the federal securities laws \nshould all be considered in financial transactions. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe RMBCA advises doing away with financial concepts such as stock par value.

One method is to reinvest profits in the \ncorporation. Another method is to use private equity. Private equity involves financing from private \ninvestors, whether individuals (angel investors) or a private equity firm. Venture capital is often used as a \nfundraising mechanism by businesses that are just starting operations. \n \nA third method is to finance through debt, such as a loan or a bond. A corporation sells a bond and agrees \nto make interest payments over the life of the bond and to pay the face value of the bond at the bond’s \nmaturity. \nThe final important method of raising capital is by the sale of stock. The articles of incorporation govern \nthe total number of shares of stock that the corporation may issue, although it need not issue the \nmaximum. Stock in the hands of shareholders is said to be authorized, issued, and outstanding. Stock may \nhave a par value, which is usually the floor price of the stock. No-par shares may be sold for any price set \nby the directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n663 \nPreferred stock (1) may have a dividend preference, (2) takes preference upon liquidation, and (3) may be \nconvertible.

A minority of states adhere to a true value rule that holds to an \nobjective standard. \n \nA corporation that sells shares for the first time engages in an initial public offering (IPO). The Securities \nAct of 1933 governs most IPOs and initial stock sales. A corporation that has previously issued stock may \ndo so many times afterward, depending on the corporation’s needs. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \ngoverns most secondary market stock sales. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 adds another layer of \nregulation to the financial transactions discussed in this chapter. \n \nA dividend is a share of a corporation’s profits. Dividends may be distributed as cash, property, or stock. \nThe law imposes certain limitations on the amount that the corporation may disburse; most states restrict \nthe cash or property available for distribution to earned surplus. However, a few states, including \nDelaware, permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current earnings and those of the immediately \npreceding year, both years taken as a single period; these are known as nimble dividends. The directors \nhave discretion, within broad limits, to set the level of dividends; however, they will be jointly and \nseverally liable if they approve dividends higher than allowed by law or under the articles of \nincorporation. \nWith several options available, corporations face many factors to consider in deciding how to raise funds. \nEach option is not available to every corporation.

The \npowers set out in this section need not be included in the articles of incorporation. \n \nImplied Powers \nCorporate powers beyond those explicitly established are implied powers. For example, suppose BCT \nBookstore, Inc.’s statement of purpose reads simply, “to operate a bookstore.” The company may lawfully \nconduct all acts that are necessary or appropriate to running a bookstore—hiring employees, advertising \nspecial sales, leasing trucks, and so forth.

Yes—if the lectures are relevant to current books on sale or serve to bring \npeople into the store, they comply with the corporation’s purpose. \n \n \nThe Ultra Vires Doctrine \nThe law places limitations upon what acts a corporation may undertake. Corporations cannot do anything \nthey wish, but rather, must act within the prescribed rules as laid out in statute, case law, their articles of \nincorporation, and their bylaws. Sometimes, though, a corporation will step outside its permitted power \n(literally “beyond the powers).

Ultra vires (literally \n“beyond the powers”) is not limited to illegal acts, although it encompasses actions barred by statute as \nwell as by the corporate charter. Under the traditional approach, either the corporation or the other party \ncould assert ultra vires as a defense when refusing to abide by a wholly executory contract. The ultra vires \ndoctrine loses much of its significance when corporate powers are broadly stated in a corporation’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n669 \narticles.

For example, particularly in the area of \nenvironmental law, plaintiffs are challenging corporate environmental actions as ultra vires. Delaware \ncorporation law states that the attorney general shall revoke the charter of a corporation for illegal acts. \nAdditionally, the Court of Chancery of Delaware has jurisdiction to forfeit or revoke a corporate charter \nfor abuse of corporate powers.

The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3.

What \nhappens if this action is ultra vires? Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. (see Section 16.5.1 \"Ultra Vires \nActs\"), focuses on this issue. An ultra vires act is not necessarily criminal or tortious. However, every \ncrime and tort is in some sense ultra vires because a corporation never has legal authority to commit \ncrimes or torts. They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent. An additional dilemma was that society could not \nliterally imprison a corporation. Modern law is not so constricting. Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation.

In 1990, however, a federal appeals court overturned the SEC rule on the grounds that voting rights \nare governed by state law rather than by federal law. [1] \n \nQuorum \nWhen the articles of incorporation are silent, a shareholder quorum is a simple majority of the shares \nentitled to vote, whether represented in person or by proxy, according to RMBCA Section 7.25. Thus if \nthere are 1 million shares, 500,001 must be represented at the shareholder meeting. A simple majority of \nthose represented shares is sufficient to carry any motion, so 250,001 shares are enough to decide upon a \nmatter other than the election of directors (governed by RMBCA, Section 7.28). The articles of \nincorporation may decree a different quorum but not less than one-third of the total shares entitled to \nvote. \n \nCumulative Voting \nCumulative voting means that a shareholder may distribute his total votes in any manner that he \nchooses—all for one candidate or several shares for different candidates. With cumulative voting, each \nshareholder has a total number of votes equal to the number of shares he owns multiplied by the number \nof directors to be elected. Thus if a shareholder has 1,000 shares and there are five directors to be elected, \nthe shareholder has 5,000 votes, and he may vote those shares in a manner he desires (all for one \ndirector, or 2,500 each for two directors, etc.).

Without cumulative \nvoting, Ted’s slate of directors would win: under statutory voting, each share represents one vote available \nfor each director position. With this method, by placing as many votes as possible for each director, Ted \ncould cast 6,000 votes for each of his desired directors. Thus each of Ted’s directors would receive 6,000 \nvotes, while each of Bob and Carol’s directors would receive only 4,000. Under cumulative voting,",

Carol vehemently objects because her percentage of ownership will decline. She goes \nto court seeking an injunction against the sale or an order permitting her to purchase 200 of the shares \n(she currently has 20 percent of the total). How should the court rule? \n \nThe answer depends on the statutory provision dealing with preemptive rights—that is, the right of a \nshareholder to be protected from dilution of her percentage of ownership. In some states, shareholders \nhave no preemptive rights unless expressly declared in the articles of incorporation, while other states \ngive shareholders preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation deny it.

She can file a \nderivative action against them. A derivative lawsuit is one brought on behalf of the corporation by a \nshareholder when the directors refuse to act.

A \nstaggered board allows for the continuity of directors or as a defense against a hostile takeover. \n \nDirectors’ Qualifications and Characteristics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n682 \nThe statutes do not catalog qualifications that directors are expected to possess. In most states, directors \nneed not be residents of the state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles of \nincorporation or bylaws, which may also set down more precise qualifications if desired. \n \nUntil the 1970s, directors tended to be a homogeneous lot: white male businessmen or lawyers. Political \nchange—rising consumer, environmental, and public interest consciousness—and embarrassment \nstemming from disclosures made in the wake of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \ninvestigations growing out of Watergate prompted companies to diversify their boardrooms. Today, \nmembers of minority groups and women are being appointed in increasing numbers, although their \nproportion to the total is still small.

The directors were held liable for $23.5 million for this breach. [2] Thus \nserving as a director or an officer was never free of business risks. Today, the task is fraught with legal risk \nas well. \n \nTwo main fiduciary duties apply to both directors and officers: one is a duty of loyalty, the other the duty \nof care. These duties arise from responsibilities placed upon directors and officers because of their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n685 \npositions within the corporation. The requirements under these duties have been refined over time. \nCourts and legislatures have both narrowed the duties by defining what is or is not a breach of each duty \nand have also expanded their scope. Courts have further refined the duties, such as laying out tests such \nas in the Caremark case, outlined in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\". Additionally, other duties have been \ndeveloped, such as the duties of good faith and candor. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nAs a fiduciary of the corporation, the director owes his primary loyalty to the corporation and its \nstockholders, as do the officers and majority shareholders. This responsibility is called \nthe duty of loyalty.

Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand.

The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations \nbecause it was the wrong decision, than a situation in which time was not of the essence. \n \nWhat of the care itself? What kind of care would an ordinarily prudent person in any situation be required \nto give? Unlike the standard of care, which can differ, the care itself has certain requirements. At a \nminimum, the director must pay attention. He must attend meetings, receive and digest information \nadequate to inform him about matters requiring board action, and monitor the performance of those to \nwhom he has delegated the task of operating the corporation. Of course, documents can be misleading, \nreports can be slanted, and information coming from self-interested management can be distorted. To \nwhat heights must suspicion be raised? Section 8.30 of the RMBCA forgives directors the necessity of \nplaying detective whenever information, including financial data, is received in an apparently reliable \nmanner from corporate officers or employees or from experts such as attorneys and public accountants. \nThus the director does not need to check with another attorney once he has received financial data from \none competent attorney. \n \nA New Jersey Supreme Court decision considered the requirements of fiduciary duties, particularly the \nduty of care.

The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase.

As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v.

In approaching that question, we note that the Chancellor characterized that definition as \n“anappropriate (although not the only) standard for determining whether fiduciaries have acted in good \nfaith.” That observation is accurate and helpful, because as a matter of simple logic, at least three different \ncategories of fiduciary behavior are candidates for the “bad faith” pejorative label. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n705 \nThe first category involves so-called “subjective bad faith,” that is, fiduciary conduct motivated by an \nactual intent to do harm.

The conduct that is the subject of due care \nmay overlap with the conduct that comes within the rubric of good faith in a psychological sense, but from \na legal standpoint those duties are and must remain quite distinct.… \n \nThe Delaware General Assembly has addressed the distinction between bad faith and a failure to exercise \ndue care (i.e., gross negligence) in two separate contexts. The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del.

To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith.

What two statutory provisions has the Delaware General Assembly passed that address the distinction \nbetween bad faith and a failure to exercise due care (i.e., gross negligence)? \n \n \n \n \n16.6 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nA corporation may exercise two types of powers: (1) express powers, set forth by statute and in the articles \nof incorporation, and (2) implied powers, necessary to carry out its stated purpose. The corporation may \nalways amend the articles of incorporation to change its purposes. Nevertheless, shareholders may enjoin \ntheir corporation from acting ultra vires, as may the state attorney general. However, an individual \nstockholder, director, or officer (except in rare instances under certain regulatory statutes) may not be \nheld vicariously liable if he did not participate in the crime or tort. \n \nBecause ownership and control are separated in the modern publicly held corporation, shareholders \ngenerally do not make business decisions. Shareholders who own voting stock do retain the power to elect \ndirectors, amend the bylaws, ratify or reject certain corporate actions, and vote on certain extraordinary \nmatters, such as whether to amend the articles of incorporation, merge, or liquidate. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n709 \nIn voting for directors, various voting methodologies may be used, such as cumulative voting, which \nprovides safeguards against removal of minority-shareholder-supported directors.

All blue sky laws have antifraud provisions; some have no other provisions. The second type \ncalls for registration of broker-dealers, and the third type for registration of securities. Some state laws \nparallel the federal laws in intent and form of proceeding, so that they overlap; other blue sky laws \nempower state officials (unlike the SEC) to judge the merits of the offerings, often referred to as \nmerit review laws. As part of a movement toward deregulation, several states have recently modified or \neliminated merit provisions. \n \nMany of the blue sky laws are inconsistent with each other, making national uniformity difficult.

Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits.

Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why?

By April 1964, word began to circulate about TGS’s find. \n \nNewspapers printed rumors, and the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced a wild speculative spree.

The SEC also alleged that the April 12, 1964, press release was deceptive. The \nUS Court of Appeals, in SEC v.

Securities and Exchange Commission (see Section 17.3.2 \"Tippee Liability\"), that \ntippees are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing \nconfidential information and the tipper received a personal benefit from the disclosure. \n \nThe Supreme Court has also refined Rule 10b-5 as it relates to the duty of a company to \ndisclose material information, as discussed in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson (see Section 17.3.3 \"Duty to \nDisclose Material Information\"). This case is also important in its discussion of the degree of reliance \ninvestors must prove to support a Rule 10b-5 action. \nIn 2000, the SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1, which defines trading “on the basis of” inside information as any \ntime a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. Therefore, a defendant is not saved \nby arguing that the trade was made independent of knowledge of the nonpublic information. However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v.

Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), concluding in the proxy-solicitation \ncontext that “[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n738 \nwould consider it important in deciding how to vote.”…We now expressly adopt the TSC Industries \nstandard of materiality for the 5 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. \n \nThe application of this materiality standard to preliminary merger discussions is not self-evident. Where \nthe impact of the corporate development on the target’s fortune is certain and clear, the TSC Industries \nmateriality definition admits straight-forward application. Where, on the other hand, the event is \ncontingent or speculative in nature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the “reasonable investor” would \nhave considered the omitted information significant at the time. Merger negotiations, because of the ever-\npresent possibility that the contemplated transaction will not be effectuated, fall into the latter category. \n \n* * * \n \nEven before this Court’s decision in TSC Industries, the Second Circuit had explained the role of the \nmateriality requirement of Rule 10b-5, with respect to contingent or speculative information or events, in \na manner that gave that term meaning that is independent of the other provisions of the Rule. Under such \ncircumstances, materiality “will depend at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated \nprobability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of \nthe company activity.” SEC v.

Emboldened by the CTS decision, almost half the states have adopted a third-generation law that requires a bidder to wait several years before merging with the target company unless the target’s board agrees in advance to the merger. Because in many cases a merger is the reason for the bid, these laws are especially powerful. In 1989, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wisconsin’s third-generation law, saying “the statute is a reasonable effort to protect the shareholders of the acquired corporation from a rapid-fire takeover by a raider who has little or no interest in the corporation except for its financial assets.” [7]"

            "chunk": "question might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business.

A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state.

Negotiability means that the paper is freely and unconditionally transferable from one \nperson to another by delivery or by delivery and indorsement. (“Indorsement,” not “endorsement,” is the \nspelling used in the UCC, though the latter is more common in nonlegal usage.) Without the ability to pay \nand finance through commercial paper, the business world would be paralyzed.

We then proceed to four \nfundamental issues that must be addressed to determine whether parties such as First Bank, in the \npreceding example, can collect: \n1. Is the paper negotiable? That is, is the paper in the proper form? We explore that issue in this \nchapter. \n2. Was the paper negotiated properly?

They fell into disuse after the collapse of the Roman Empire and \nthen reappeared in Italy around the fourteenth century. They became more common as long-distance \ncommerce spread. In an era before paper currency, payment in coins or bullion was awkward, especially \nfor merchants who traveled great distances across national boundaries to attend the fairs at which most \neconomic exchanges took place. Merchants and traders found it far more efficient to pay with paper. \n \nBills of exchange, today commonly known as drafts, were recognized instruments in the law merchant. \n(The “law merchant” was the system of rules and customs recognized and adopted by early-modern \ntraders and is the basis of the UCC Article 3.) A draft is an unconditional order by one person (the drawer) \ndirecting another person (drawee or payor) to pay money to a named third person or to bearer; a check is \nthe most familiar type of draft. The international merchant courts regularly enforced drafts and permitted \nthem to be transferred to others by indorsement (the legal spelling of endorsement). By the beginning of \nthe sixteenth century, the British common-law courts began to hear cases involving bills of exchange, but \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n779 \nit took a half century before the courts became comfortable with them and accepted them as crucial to the \ngrowing economy. \n \nCourts were also hesitant until the end of the seventeenth century about sanctioning a transferor’s \nassignment of a promissory note if it meant that the transferee would have better title than the transferor. \nOne reason for the courts’ reluctance to sanction assignments stemmed from the law that permitted \ndebtors to be jailed, a law that was not repealed until 1870.

It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly.

Recall from Section 19.1 \n\"Introduction to Commercial Paper\" that Lorna Love wished to buy tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc. \nSuppose Love had the money to pay but did not want to do so before delivery. Rackets, on the other hand, \ndid not want to ship before Love paid. The solution: a sight draft, drawn on Love, to which would be \nattached an order bill of lading that Rackets received from the trucker when it shipped the rackets. The \nsight draft and bill of lading go to a bank in Love’s city. When the tennis rackets arrive, the carrier notifies \nthe bank, which presents the draft to Love for payment. When she has done so, the bank gives Love the \nbill of lading, entitling her to receive the shipment. The bank forwards the payment to Rackets’ bank, \nwhich credits Rackets’ account with the purchase amount. \n \nA time draft, not surprisingly, calls for payment on a date specified in the draft. Suppose that Love will \nnot have sufficient cash to pay until she has sold the rackets but that Rackets needs to be paid \nimmediately. The solution: a common form of time draft known as a trade acceptance. Rackets, the seller, \ndraws a draft on Love, who thus becomes a drawee. The draft orders Love to pay the purchase price to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n784 \norder of Rackets, as payee, on a fixed date. Rackets presents the draft to Love, who accepts it by signing \nher name.

The first negotiable CD was issued in 1961 by First National City Bank of New York (now \nCitibank); it was designed to compete for corporate cash that companies were investing in Treasury notes \nand other funds.

To be payable to order, the instrument must so state, as most ordinarily do, by placing the \nwords “payable to order of” before the name of the payee.

Section \n3-203(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides that “an instrument is transferred when it is \ndelivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the \nright to enforce the instrument.” \n \nNegotiation and Holder \nSection 3-201(a) of the UCC defines negotiation as “a transfer of possession, whether voluntary or \ninvoluntary, of an instrument to a person who thereby becomes its holder if possession is obtained from a \nperson other than the issuer of the instrument.” A holder is defined in Section 1-201(2) as “a person who \nis in possession of an instrument drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank” \n(“in blank” means that no indorsement is required for negotiation). The original issuing or making of an \ninstrument is not negotiation, though a holder can be the beneficiary of either a transfer or a negotiation. \nThe Official Comment to 3-201(a) is helpful: \n \nA person can become holder of an instrument when the instrument is issued to that person, or the \nstatus of holder can arise as the result of an event that occurs after issuance. “Negotiation” is the \nterm used in article 3 to describe this post-issuance event. Normally, negotiation occurs as the \nresult of a voluntary transfer of possession of an instrument by a holder to another person who \nbecomes the holder as a result of the transfer. Negotiation always requires a change in possession \nof the instrument because nobody can be a holder without possessing the instrument, either \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n812 \ndirectly or through an agent.

If Rackets’ agent \nsigns the check “Rackets, Inc.” together with the words “Pay half to City Water, /s/ Agent” and delivers \nthe check to City Water, that does not operate as an indorsement, and City Water becomes an assignee, \nnot a holder. \n \nBlank Indorsement \nA blank indorsement consists of the indorser’s signature alone (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of \nEndorsement\", left). A blank indorsement converts the instrument into paper closely akin to cash. Since \nthe indorsement does not specify to whom the instrument is to be paid, it is treated like bearer paper—\nassuming, of course, that the first indorser is the person to whom the instrument was payable originally. A \npaper with blank indorsement may be negotiated by delivery alone, until such time as a holder converts it \ninto aspecial indorsement (discussed next) by writing over the signature any terms consistent with the \nindorsement.

Once specially \nindorsed, the check (or other instrument) can be negotiated further only when the special indorsee adds \nhis own signature. A holder may convert a blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing above \nthe signature of the indorser words of a contractual nature consistent with the character of the \ninstrument. \n \nSo, for example, Lorna Love’s check to Rackets, Inc., indorsed in blank (signed by its agent or stamped \nwith Rackets’ indorsement stamp—its name alone) and handed to City Water, is not very safe: it is bearer",

                    "answer": "The purpose of a blank indorsement is to convert the instrument into paper closely akin to cash. Since the indorsement does not specify to whom the instrument is to be paid, it is treated like bearer paper—assuming, of course, that the first indorser is the person to whom the instrument was payable originally. A paper with blank indorsement may be negotiated by delivery alone, until such time as a holder converts it into aspecial indorsement (discussed next) by writing over the signature any terms consistent with the indorsement. For example, a check indorsed by the payee (signed on the back) may be passed from one person to another and cashed in by any of them."

It says that if an employer \n“entrust[s] an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person \nacting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement \nis effective.” [4] For example (adapted from UCC 3-405, Official Comment 3; the Comment does not use \nthe names of these characters, of course), the duties of Abby Accountant, a bookkeeper, include posting \nthe amounts of checks payable to Lorna Love to the accounts of the drawers of the checks. Accountant \nsteals a check payable to Love, which was entrusted to Accountant, and forges Love’s indorsement. The \ncheck is deposited by Accountant to an account in the depositary bank that Accountant opened in the \nsame name as Lorna Love, and the check is honored by the drawee bank. The indorsment is effective as \nLove’s indorsement because Accountant’s duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes. \nThus Accountant is entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check. Neither the depositary bank \nnor the drawee bank is liable to Love for conversion of the check. The same result would follow if \nAccountant deposited the check in the account in the depositary bank without indorsement (UCC, Section \n4-205(a)). Under Section 4-205(c), deposit in a depositary bank in an account in a name substantially \nsimilar to that of Lorna Love is the equivalent of an indorsement in the name of Lorna Love. If, say, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n829 \njanitor had stolen the checks, the result would be different, as the janitor is not entrusted with \nresponsibility regarding the instrument. \n \nNegligence \nNot surprisingly, though, if a person fails to exercise ordinary care and thereby substantially contributes \nto the success of a forgery, that person cannot assert “the alteration or the forgery against a person that, in \ngood faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value.” [5] If the issuer is also negligent, the loss is allocated \nbetween them based on comparative negligence theories.

Section 3-\n405(b) states, in relevant part: \n \nIf the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise \nordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss \nresulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to \nexercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. \n \nWachovia argues that this section is applicable only in cases of forged indorsements, and not in double \nforgery situations. However, at least one court has found that the new revisions have made section 3-405 \napply to double forgery situations. “Nothing in the [Revised UCC] statutory language indicates that, where \nthe signature of the drawer is forged…the drawer is otherwise precluded from seeking recovery from a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n839 \ndepositary bank under these sections” [Citation]…The Court finds the reasoning persuasive and holds \nthat…Victory can maintain its cause of action against Wachovia. \n \nIII.

Rosenfeld never had any problems with Lunny’s bookkeeping before she resigned. \n• \nLunny exercised primary control over Victory’s bank accounts. \n• \nBetween 2001 and 2003, the checks that were generated to make payments to Victory’s vendors \nwere all computerized checks generated by Lunny. No other Victory employee, other than Lunny, \nknew how to generate the computerized checks, including Rosenfeld. \n• \nThe fraudulent checks were made payable to known vendors of Victory in amounts that were \nconsistent with previous legitimate checks to those vendors. \n•",

Therefore, the Court \nconcludes that Wachovia is seventy (70) percent liable for Victory’s loss. \n \nVictory, on the other hand, was also negligent in its supervision of Lunny, and for not discovering the \nfraud for almost a two-year period. Rosenfeld received copies of the cancelled checks, albeit smaller in \nsize, on a monthly basis from Hudson Bank. The copies of the checks displayed both the front and back of \nthe checks. Rosenfeld was negligent in not recognizing his own forged signature on the front of the checks, \nas well as not spotting his own bookkeeper’s name and/or account number on the back of the checks \n(which appeared far too many times and on various “payees” checks to be seen as regular by a non-\nnegligent business owner). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n842 \n \nFurther, there were inadequate checks and balances in Victory’s record keeping process.

Here, Lunny exercised primary control over Victory’s \nbank accounts. Another Victory employee, or Rosenfeld himself, could have reviewed Lunny’s work. In \naddition, Victory could have increased the amount of authorization that was needed to perform certain \ntransactions. For example, any check that was over a threshold monetary amount would have to be \nauthorized by more than one individual. This would ensure an additional control on checks that were \nlarger in amounts. Furthermore, Victory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each \nmonth. When any check was created by Victory’s computer system, the value of the check was \nautomatically assigned to a general ledger account before the check could be printed. The values in the \ngeneral ledger account could have been reconciled at the end of each month with the actual checks and \ninvoices.

But a holder’s rights are ordinary, as we noted briefly in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of \nCommercial Paper\". If a person to whom an instrument is negotiated becomes nothing more than a \nholder, the law of commercial paper would not be very significant, nor would a negotiable instrument be a \nparticularly useful commercial device. A mere holder is simply an assignee, who acquires the assignor’s \nrights but also his liabilities; an ordinary holder must defend against claims and overcome defenses just as \nhis assignor would. The holder in due course is really the crux of the concept of commercial paper and the \nkey to its success and importance. What the holder in due course gets is an instrument free of claims or \ndefenses by previous possessors. A holder with such a preferred position can then treat the instrument \nalmost as money, free from the worry that someone might show up and prove it defective. \n \nRequirements for Being a Holder in Due Course \nUnder Section 3-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), to be a holder in due course (HDC), a \ntransferee must fulfill the following: \n1. Be a holder of a negotiable instrument; \n2. Have taken it: \na) for value, \nb) in good faith, \nc) without notice \n(1) that it is overdue or",

A purchaser with knowledge \ncannot become an HDC. But proving knowledge is difficult, so the UCC at Section 3-302(2) lists several \ntypes of notice that presumptively defeat any entitlement to status as HDC. Notice is not limited to receipt \nof an explicit statement; it includes an inference that a person should have made from the circumstances. \nThe explicit things that give a person notice include those that follow. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Is Overdue \nThe UCC provides generally that a person who has notice that an instrument is overdue cannot be an \nHDC. What constitutes notice? When an inspection of the instrument itself would show that it was due \nbefore the purchaser acquired it, notice is presumed. A transferee to whom a promissory note due April \n23 is negotiated on April 24 has notice that it was overdue and consequently is not an HDC.

On August 2, Betsy gives the note to Al as a token of her affection. Al is Clifford’s friend and knows \nabout the scam (see Figure 21.1 \"The Shelter Rule\"). May Al collect? \n \nFigure 21.1 The Shelter Rule \n \n \nBegin the analysis by noting that Al is not an HDC. Why? For three reasons: he did not take the \ninstrument for value (it was a gift), he did not take in good faith (he knew of the fraud), and he had notice \n(he acquired it after the due date). Nevertheless, Al is entitled to collect from Harold the full $250,000. \nHis right to do so flows from UCC, Section 3-203(b): “Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the \ntransfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, \nincluding any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due \ncourse by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument.” \n \nBy virtue of the shelter rule, Al as transferee from Betsy acquires all rights that she had as transferor. \nClearly Betsy is an HDC: she paid for the instrument, she took it in good faith, had no notice of any claim \nor defense against the instrument, and there were no apparent irregularities. Since Betsy is an HDC, so is \nAl. His knowledge of the fraud does not undercut his rights as HDC because he was not a party to it and \nwas not a prior holder. Now suppose that after negotiating the instrument to Betsy, Clifford repurchased \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n861 \nit from her. He would not be an HDC—and would not acquire all Betsy’s rights—because he had been a \nparty to fraud and as a prior holder had notice of a defense. The purpose of the shelter rule is “to assure \nthe holder in due course a free market for the paper.”[2] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine is important because it allows the holder of a negotiable instrument to take \nthe paper free from most claims and defenses against it. Without the doctrine, such a holder would be a mere \ntransferee. The UCC provides that to be an HDC, a person must be a holder of paper that is not suspiciously \nirregular, and she must take it in good faith, for value, and without notice of anything that a reasonable \nperson would recognize as tainting the instrument.

But a holder who is not an HDC is subject to \nthem: he takes a negotiable instrument subject to the possible personal claims and defenses of numerous \npeople. \nIn general, the personal defenses—to which the HDC is not subject—are similar to the whole range of \ndefenses for breach of simple contract: lack of consideration; failure of consideration; duress, undue \ninfluence, and misrepresentation that does not render the transaction void; breach of warranty; \nunauthorized completion of an incomplete instrument; prior payment. Incapacity that does not render the \ntransaction void (except infancy) is also a personal defense. As the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) puts \nit, this includes “mental incompetence, guardianship, ultra vires acts or lack of corporate capacity to do \nbusiness, or any other incapacity apart from infancy.

If the effect is merely to render the obligation voidable at the election of the obligor, the defense is \ncut off.” [1] James White and Robert Summers, in their hornbook on the UCC, opine that unconscionability \nis almost always a personal defense, not assertable against an HDC. [2] But again, the HDC takes free only \nfrom personal defenses of parties with whom she has not dealt. So while the payee of a note can be an \nHDC, if he dealt with the maker, he is subject to the maker’s defenses. \n \nHolder in Due Course Is Subject to Real Defenses \nAn HDC in a nonconsumer transaction is not subject to personal defenses, but he is subject to the so-\ncalled real defenses (or “universal defenses”)—they are good against an HDC. \nThe real defenses good against any holder, including HDCs, are as follows (see Figure 21.2 \"Real \nDefenses\"): \n \n1.

[Citation] Under that standard, absent fraudulent behavior, an \notherwise innocent party was assumed to have acted in good faith. The “honesty in fact” requirement, also \nknown as the “pure heart and empty head” doctrine, is a subjective test under which a holder had to \nsubjectively believe he was negotiating an instrument in good faith for him to become a holder in due \ncourse. Maine [Citation, 1999]. \n \nIn 1994, however, the Ohio legislature amended the definition of “good faith” to include not only the \nsubjective “honesty in fact” test, but also an objective test: “the observance of reasonable commercial \nstandards of fair dealing.” Ohio UCC 1-201(20). A holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective \nand an objective test of good faith.

Honesty in fact is a subjective test, but the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards is objective. \n \nNotice is not limited to receipt of an explicit statement of defenses; a holder may be given notice through \ninferences that should be drawn from the character of the instrument. Thus an incomplete instrument, \none that bears marks of forgery, or one that indicates it is overdue may give notice on its face. Certain \nfacts do not necessarily give notice of defense or claim: that the instrument is antedated or postdated, that \nthe instrument was negotiated in return for an executory promise, that any party has signed for \naccommodation, that an incomplete instrument has been completed, that any person negotiating the \ninstrument is or was a fiduciary, or that there has been default in payment of interest or principal. \nA person who could not have become an HDC directly (e.g., because he had notice of a defense or claim) \nmay become so if he takes as transferee from an HDC as long as he was not a party to any fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument or had not previously been a holder with notice of a defense or claim. \nThis is the shelter rule. \n \nHolders in due course are not immune from all defenses.

If the reason she isn’t entitled to payment is because Payee’s signature \nwas forged by Thief, then Maker can go after Thief: the UCC says that “the person obtaining payment \n[Subsequent Party] and a prior transferor [Thief] warrant to the person making payment in good faith \n[Maker] that the warrantor [Subsequent Party] is entitled to enforce the instrument.” [5] Or, again, Drawer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n905 \nmakes the check out to Payee; Payee attempts to cash or deposit the check, but it is dishonored. Payee \npresents the check to Drawer to make it good: Payee warrants he is entitled to payment on it. \n \nWarranties cannot be disclaimed in the case of checks (because, as UCC Section 3-417, Comment 7, puts \nit, “it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be \nexamined by the payor bank”—they’re machine read). But a disclaimer of warranties is permitted as to \nother instruments, just as disclaimers of warranty are usually OK under general contract law. The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake. The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it \n(when there was), or that the drawer’s signature was authorized (when it was not), or that there were \nsufficient funds in the drawer’s account to pay it (when there were not), “the drawee may recover the \namount paid…or in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.” [6]Except—and it’s a big \nexception—such a recovery of funds does not apply “against a person who took the instrument in good \nfaith and for value.” [7] The drawee in that case would have to go after the forger, the unauthorized signer, \nor, in the case of insufficient funds, the drawer. Example: Able draws a check to Baker. Baker deposits the \ncheck in her bank account, and Able’s bank mistakenly pays it even though Able doesn’t have enough \nmoney in his account to cover it. Able’s bank cannot get the money back from Baker: it has to go after",

One example \ninvolves an employer who leaves a rubber stamp and blank checks accessible to an employee who later \ncommits forgery; another example involves a company that issues a ten dollar check but leaves a blank \nspace after the figure which allows the payee to turn the amount into ten thousand dollars; and the third \nexample involves an insurance company that mails a check to one policyholder whose name is the same as \nanother policyholder who was entitled to the check. In each case, the company’s negligence substantially \ncontributed to the alterations or forgeries by making it easier for the wrongdoer to commit the \nmalfeasance. \n \nIn the present case, we find no negligence in Farm Bureau’s delivery of the check to the Russells.

Furthermore, under § 3-420, if a check is payable to more than one \npayee, delivery to one of the payees is deemed to be delivery to all payees.

We reiterate that the \ncontract does not apply to Petitioner and, similarly, does not give him a cause of action against the Bank \nfor refusing to accept the check. This also means that the Bank cannot rely on the contract as a defense \nagainst the Petitioner, on the facts presented here, to say that it did not dishonor the check. \n \nPetitioner, as noted, argues that requiring a thumbprint violates his privacy, and further argues that a \nthumbprint is not a reasonable form of identification because it does not prove contemporaneously the \nidentity of an over the counter presenter at the time presentment is made. According to Petitioner, the \npurpose of requiring “reasonable identification” is to allow the drawee bank to determine that the \npresenter is the proper person to be paid on the instrument.

PNC charged Martin’s account, leaving it with an \noverdraft. Martin was obliged to pay PNC immediately. \n \nAs with the breach-of-transfer-warranties claim, Martin cannot defend against the breach-of-contract \nclaim by arguing that PNC made a mistake. The account agreement authorized PNC to charge back \nMartin’s account “even if the amount of the item has already been made available to you.” The account \nagreement, as a result, placed the risk of loss on Martin. Any mistake on PNC’s part was immaterial \nbecause PNC always had the right to charge back Martin’s account. [Citation] \n \nC. Martin’s Counterclaims \nMartin has asserted counterclaims for violations of various Uniform Commercial Code provisions; \nnegligence and failure to exercise ordinary care; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; detrimental reliance; conversion; and \nnegligent retention and supervision. Martin argues that “[t]o the extent that either party should be \nentitled to summary judgment in this case, it would be Martin with respect to his counterclaims against \nPNC.” Martin, however, has not moved for summary judgment on his counterclaims, and the court does \nnot address them on PNC’s motion. \n \nD. Damages \nPNC’s recovery under both theories of liability is contingent on PNC’s demonstrating that it acted in good \nfaith.

Moreover, PNC must satisfy the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which Kentucky \nlaw incorporates in the account agreement.

Reserve Banks handle about 27 percent of US checks, but the air \nservice is decreasing with “Check 21,” a federal law discussed below, that allows electronic transmission of \nchecks. \n \nCorrespondent banks are banks that have formed “partnerships” with other banks in order to \nexchange checks and payments directly, bypassing the Federal Reserve and its fees. Outside banks may go \nthrough a correspondent bank to exchange checks and payments with one of its partners. \n \nCorrespondent banks may also form a clearinghouse corporation, in which members exchange \nchecks and payments in bulk, instead of on a check-by-check basis, which can be inefficient considering \nthat each bank might receive thousands of checks in a day. The clearinghouse banks save up the checks \ndrawn on other members and exchange them on a daily basis. The net payments for these checks are often \nsettled through Fedwire, a Federal Reserve Board electronic funds transfer (EFT) system that handles \nlarge-scale check settlement among US banks. Correspondent banks and clearinghouse corporations \nmake up the private sector of check clearing, and together they handle about 43 percent of US checks. \n \nThe Electronic System: Check 21 Act \nRationale for the “Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act” \nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, Congress felt with renewed urgency that banks needed to present \nand clear checks in a way not dependent upon the physical transportation of the paper instruments by air \nand ground, in case such transportation facilities were disrupted.

A bank scans the \ncheck. The data on the check is already encoded in electronically readable numbers and the data, now \nseparated (“truncated”) from the paper instrument (which may be destroyed), is transmitted for \nprocessing. “The Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument, called a substitute check, to replace the \noriginal check. A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that is suitable for \nautomated processing in the same manner as the original check.

Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows.",

Certainly, however, electronic transfers are most common, and—as the Preface to \nArticle 4A notes—a number of characteristics of them influenced the Code’s rules. These transactions are \ncharacterized by large amounts of money—multimillions of dollars; the parties are sophisticated \nbusinesses or financial institutions; funds transfers are completed in one day, they are highly efficient \nsubstitutes for paper delivery; they are usually low cost—a few dollars for the funds transfer charged by \nthe sender’s bank. \n \nOperation of Article 4A \nThe UCC “Prefatory Note” to Article 4A observes that “the funds transfer that is covered by Article 4A is \nnot a complex transaction.” To illustrate the operation of Article 4A, assume that Widgets International \nhas an account with First Bank. In order to pay a supplier, Supplies Ltd., in China, Widgets instructs First \nBank to pay $6 million to the account of Supplies Ltd. in China Bank. In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and \nSupplies Ltd. is still the beneficiary. This transaction is depicted in Figure 23.3 \"Funds Transfer\". In some \ntransactions there may also be one or more “intermediary banks” between First and Second Bank. \n \nFigure 23.3 Funds Transfer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n959 \n \n \nFrequently Occurring Legal Issues in Funds Transfers \nThree legal issues that frequently arise in funds transfer litigation are addressed in Article 4A and might \nbe mentioned here. \n \nResponsibility for Unauthorized Payments \nFirst, who is responsible for unauthorized payment orders? The usual practice is for banks and their \ncustomers to agree to security procedures for the verification of payment orders. If a bank establishes a \ncommercially reasonable procedure, complies with that procedure, and acts in good faith and according to \nits agreement with the customer, the customer is bound by an unauthorized payment order.

The \nimporter’s bank may require that the buyer put up collateral to guarantee it will be reimbursed for \npayment of the draft when it is presented by the seller’s agents.

Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn.

A uniform state act, the Uniform \nConsumer Credit Code, as amended in 1974, is now on the books in twelve US jurisdictions, [3] though its \neffect on the development of modern consumer credit law has been significant beyond the number of \nstates adopting it. It is designed to protect consumers who buy goods and services on credit by \nsimplifying, clarifying, and updating legislation governing consumer credit and usury. \n \nGetting Credit \nDisclosure of credit costs is a good thing. After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check. And somebody who knows another person’s \ncreditworthiness has what is usually considered confidential information, the possession of which is \nsubject to abuse, and thus regulation. \n \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThrough the 1960s, banks and other lending and credit-granting institutions regularly discriminated \nagainst women. Banks told single women to find a cosigner for loans. Divorced women discovered that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n993 \nthey could not open store charge accounts because they lacked a prior credit history, even though they had \ncontributed to the family income on which previous accounts had been based. Married couples found that \nthe wife’s earnings were not counted when they sought credit; indeed, families planning to buy homes \nwere occasionally even told that the bank would grant a mortgage if the wife would submit to a \nhysterectomy! In all these cases, the premise of the refusal to treat women equally was the unstated—and \nusually false—belief that women would quit work to have children or simply to stay home. \n \nBy the 1970s, as women became a major factor in the labor force, Congress reacted to the manifest \nunfairness of the discrimination by enacting (as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974.

Because \ncredit is such a big business, a number of support industries have grown up around it. One of the most \nimportant is the credit-reporting industry, which addresses this issue of checking creditworthiness. \nCertain companies—credit bureaus—collect information about borrowers, holders of credit cards, store \naccounts, and installment purchasers.

The TILA requires lenders to use a standard term, the annual percentage rate (APR), to describe the cost of credit.

The FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate and complete files on consumers, to provide consumers with access to their files, and to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information in their files is accurate. The FCRA also gives consumers the right to dispute inaccurate information in their files and to have it corrected or deleted. In addition, the FCRA requires credit reporting agencies to provide consumers with a free copy of their credit report once a year."

The federal law covers everyone who \nreceives personal earnings, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and retirement income \n(though not tips), but it allows courts to garnish above the federal maximum in cases involving support \npayments (e.g., alimony), in personal bankruptcy cases, and in cases where the debt owed is for state or \nfederal tax. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1000 \nThe federal wage-garnishment law also prohibits an employer from firing any worker solely because the \nworker’s pay has been garnished for one debt (multiple garnishments may be grounds for discharge). The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor.

Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought.

Decedent executed the note and appellant gave him the full amount of the note in \ncash.…[The estate] moved for summary judgment voiding the note on the ground that it was a usurious \nloan, the note having been previously rejected as a claim against the estate.

Here, since both sides concede that the note \nevidences the complete agreement between the parties, we cannot aid appellant by reliance upon the \npresumption that he did not make the loan at a usurious rate [Citation].

A general intent to charge more than the legal rate as evidenced \nby the note, is all that is needed. If the lender intends to take and receive a rate in excess of the legal \npercentage at the time the note is made, the statute condemns the act and mandates its cancellation \n[Citation].

After entering into a credit transaction, a consumer has certain \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1015 \ncancellation rights and may use a procedure prescribed by the Fair Credit Billing Act to correct billing \nerrors.

Understand how the security interest is created—”attached”—and perfected. \n \n \n \nThe Problem of Security \nCreditors want assurances that they will be repaid by the debtor. An oral promise to pay is no security at \nall, and—as it is oral—it is difficult to prove. A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor \nto repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a \ndefaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security \nfor the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an \nagreement. \n \nBy Agreement with the Debtor \nSecurity obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most \ncommon form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated \nparty does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate. \n \nBy Operation of Law \nSecurity obtained through operation of law is known as a lien. Derived from the French for “string” or \n“tie,” a lien is the legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another in order to secure payment or \ndischarge an obligation. \n \nIn this chapter, we take up security interests in personal property and suretyship. In the next chapter, we \nlook at mortgages and nonconsensual liens. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1020 \n \nBasics of Secured Transactions \nThe law of secured transactions consists of five principal components: (1) the nature of property that can \nbe the subject of a security interest; (2) the methods of creating the security interest; (3) the perfection of \nthe security interest against claims of others; (4) priorities among secured and unsecured creditors—that \nis, who will be entitled to the secured property if more than one person asserts a legal right to it; and (5) \nthe rights of creditors when the debtor defaults. After considering the source of the law and some key \nterminology, we examine each of these components in turn. \nHere is the simplest (and most common) scenario: Debtor borrows money or obtains credit from Creditor, \nsigns a note and security agreement putting up collateral, and promises to pay the debt or, upon Debtor’s \ndefault, let Creditor (secured party) take possession of (repossess) the collateral and sell it.

For example, Creditor \nCar Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a \npurchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper). The chattel paper \nis not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from \nLift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to \nLift Co.

Thus this so-called field pledge \nis rare. \n \nMore common is the field warehouse. The field warehouse can take one of two forms.

The law governing agreements for personal property security is \nArticle 9 of the UCC. The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest. This is usually accomplished \nwhen the debtor, in return for value (a loan or credit) extended from the creditor, puts up as collateral some \nvaluable asset in which she has an interest and authenticates (signs) a security agreement (the contract) giving \nthe creditor a security interest in collateral and allowing that the creditor may take it if the debtor defaults. \nThe UCC lists various kinds of assets that can be collateralized, ranging from tangible property (goods), to \nassets only able to be manifested by paper (indispensable paper), to intangible assets (like patent rights). \nSometimes no security agreement is necessary, mostly if the creditor takes possession of the collateral. After \nattachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors \nclaim an interest in the collateral.

It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does.

Two requirements limit the creditor’s power to resell: (1) it must \nsend notice to the debtor and secondary obligor, and (unless consumer goods are sold) to other secured \nparties; and (2) all aspects of the sale must be “commercially reasonable.” [3] Most frequently the collateral \nis auctioned off. \n \nSection 9-615 of the UCC describes how the proceeds are applied: first, to the costs of the repossession, \nincluding reasonable attorney’s fees and legal expenses as provided for in the security agreement (and it \nwill provide for that!); second, to the satisfaction of the obligation owed; and third, to junior creditors. \nThis again emphasizes the importance of promptly perfecting the security interest: failure to do so \nfrequently subordinates the tardy creditor’s interest to junior status. If there is money left over from \ndisposing of the collateral—a surplus—the debtor gets that back. If there is still money owing—a \ndeficiency—the debtor is liable for that. In Section 9-616, the UCC carefully explains how the surplus or \ndeficiency is calculated; the explanation is required in a consumer goods transaction, and it has to be sent \nto the debtor after the disposition. \n \nStrict Foreclosure \nBecause resale can be a bother (or the collateral is appreciating in value), the secured creditor may wish \nsimply to accept the collateral in full satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the debt, as permitted in UCC \nSection 9-620(a).

Understand the rights among cosureties. \n \n \nDefinition, Types of Sureties, and Creation of the Suretyship \nDefinition \nSuretyship is the second of the three major types of consensual security arrangements noted at the \nbeginning of this chapter (personal property security, suretyship, real property security)—and a common \none. Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the \ncompany, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts. The earliest \nsureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee. \nToday most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as \nsuretyship). \n \nA surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by the principal debtor, and, \nstrictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the \nsurety when the debt is due. The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, \nstrictly speaking) owes an obligation. Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up \ncollateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain \nthe creditor is paid or performance is made. For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his \ncorporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000.

The consideration for the guarantor’s agreement is different from the consideration for the principal debtor’s contract—usually the guarantor’s consideration is the principal debtor’s promise to pay the guarantor’s fees, and the guarantor’s agreement to guarantee the principal debtor’s performance or payment is in exchange for the principal debtor’s promise to pay the guarantor’s fees.

                    "answer": "A surety bond is a three-party contract in which one party, known as the principal, is bound to another party, known as the obligee, by the surety, who agrees to be responsible for the principal's debt or obligation. The purpose of a surety bond is to ensure that the principal will fulfill their obligation to the obligee. For example, a contractor may be required to post a surety bond to ensure that they will complete a construction project according to the terms of the contract."

[2] \n \nDuties and Rights of the Surety \nDuties of the Surety \nUpon the principal debtor’s default, the surety is contractually obligated to perform unless the principal \nherself or someone on her behalf discharges the obligation. When the surety performs, it must do so in \ngood faith. Because the principal debtor’s defenses are generally limited, and because—as will be noted—\nthe surety has the right to be reimbursed by the debtor, debtors not infrequently claim the surety acted in \nbad faith by doing things like failing to make an adequate investigation (to determine if the debtor really \ndefaulted), overpaying claims, interfering with the contact between the surety and the debtor, and making \nunreasonable refusals to let the debtor complete the project. The case Fidelity and Deposit Co. of \nMaryland v. Douglas Asphalt Co.,in Section 25.5 \"Cases\", is typical. \n \nRights of the Surety \nThe surety has four main rights stemming from its obligation to answer for the debt or default of the \nprincipal debtor. \n \n \n \nExoneration \nIf, at the time a surety’s obligation has matured, the principal can satisfy the obligation but refuses to do \nso, the surety is entitled to exoneration—a court order requiring the principal to perform. It would be \ninequitable to force the surety to perform and then to have to seek reimbursement from the principal if \nall along the principal is able to perform. \n \nReimbursement \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1058 \nIf the surety must pay the creditor because the principal has defaulted, the principal is obligated to \nreimburse the surety. The amount required to be reimbursed includes the surety’s reasonable, good-faith \noutlays, including interest and legal fees. \n \nSubrogation \nSuppose the principal’s duty to the creditor is fully satisfied and that the surety has contributed to this \nsatisfaction. Then the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor against the principal. \nIn other words, the surety stands in the creditor’s shoes and may assert against the principal whatever \nrights the creditor could have asserted had the duty not been discharged. The right \nof subrogation includes the right to take secured interests that the creditor obtained from the principal \nto cover the duty. Sarah’s Pizzeria owes Martha $5,000, and Martha has taken a security interest in \nSarah’s Chevrolet. Eva is surety for the debt. Sarah defaults, and Eva pays Martha the $5,000. Eva is",

However, the \nsurety may contract with the creditor to be liable despite the principal’s defenses, and a surety who has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1059 \nundertaken the suretyship with knowledge of the creditor’s fraud or duress remains obligated, even \nthough the principal debtor will be discharged. When the surety turns to the principal debtor and \ndemands reimbursement, the latter may have defenses against the surety—as noted—for acting in bad \nfaith. \n \nOne of the main reasons creditors want the promise of a surety is to avoid the risk that the principal \ndebtor will go bankrupt: the debtor’s bankruptcy is a defense to the debtor’s liability, certainly, but that \ndefense cannot be used by the surety. The same is true of the debtor’s incapacity: it is a defense available \nto the principal debtor but not to the surety. \n \nDefenses of the Surety \nGenerally, the surety may exercise defenses on a contract that would have been available to the principal \ndebtor (e.g., creditor’s breach; impossibility or illegality of performance; fraud, duress, or \nmisrepresentation by creditor; statute of limitations; refusal of creditor to accept tender or performance \nfrom either debtor or surety.)

                    "question": "Why isn’t collateral put up by the debtor sufficient security for the creditor—why is a surety often required?",
                    "answer": "A surety is a third party who is obligated to a creditor for the debt of a primary debtor. A surety is not a creditor, but rather a guarantor of the debt. In other words, a surety is someone who agrees to pay a debt if the primary debtor fails to do so. Sureties are used in a variety of situations, including when a person wants to borrow money but does not have the creditworthiness to do so. In this case, the surety would agree to pay the debt if the primary debtor fails to do so.\n\nThe main reason why collateral is not sufficient security for a creditor is that it is not a guarantee that the debt will be paid. Collateral is an asset that is used as security for a loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the creditor can seize the collateral and sell it to recoup some of the money that is owed. However, if the borrower has no assets, the creditor has no way to recoup the money that is owed. This is why sureties are often used in situations where the primary debtor does not have the creditworthiness to borrow money.\n\nSureties are often used in business transactions as well. For example, a business may require a surety bond from a contractor before beginning work on a project. This bond is a guarantee that the contractor will complete the work and pay any debts that are incurred as a result of the project.\n\nIn summary, sureties are used when a person or business does not have the creditworthiness to borrow money or complete a project. They provide a guarantee that the debt will be paid if the primary debtor fails to do so.\n\nI hope this helps!"

                    "answer": "Sureties are not insurance companies. Sureties are individuals or companies that agree to pay a debt if the primary debtor fails to do so. In other words, a surety is someone who agrees to pay a debt if the primary debtor defaults on the loan.\n\nInsurance companies, on the other hand, are businesses that provide financial protection against losses. When you purchase an insurance policy, you are paying a premium in exchange for the insurance company agreeing to pay a certain amount of money if you suffer a loss. For example, if you have car insurance, the insurance company will pay for any damages to your car if you are in an accident.\n\nThe main difference between sureties and insurance companies is that sureties are not providing financial protection against losses. They are simply agreeing to pay a debt if the primary debtor fails to do so. In other words, a surety is not insuring against a loss, they are simply agreeing to pay a debt.\n\nSureties avoid losses by making sure that the primary debtor has the ability to repay the loan. They will typically require the primary debtor to provide collateral or other assets that can be used to pay the debt if the primary debtor defaults. In this way, the surety is not taking on the full risk of the loan, they are simply agreeing to pay the debt if the primary debtor fails to do so.\n\nIn summary, sureties are not insurance companies. They are individuals or companies that agree to pay a debt if the primary debtor fails to do so. Sureties avoid losses by making sure that the primary debtor has the ability to repay the loan."

Does the fact that the purchaser bought the goods as a special \ngift to another person signify that it was not for his own “personal, family or household purposes”? The \ntrustee urges that these special facts control under the express provisions of the commercial code. \n \nBy a process of exclusion, a diamond engagement ring purchased for one’s fiancée is not “equipment” \nbought or used in business, “farm products” used in farming operations, or “inventory” held for sale, lease \nor service contracts.

Finally, to reflect very recent experiences, the\nauthors have incorporated several discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people\nand businesses.\nThroughout, there is an emphasis on data use in business decision-making, with integrative sections on the\nimportance and analysis of financial, economic, and statistical data. Data types include FRED\n(https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed)® economic data, company financial statements, and stock prices.\nPractical techniques and calculation examples for data analysis with financial calculators (the Texas\nInstruments BA II Plus™ Professional model is used as the basis for example illustrations) and/or spreadsheets\nare included for relevant topics. For key chapters, downloadable Microsoft® Excel® data files are available for\nstudent reference. This technical feature provides students with access to the Excel data files used in the\nchapter examples for time value of money (Chapters 7, 8, 9) and statistics (Chapters 14, 15, 16) problems. The\ndownloadable files for the chapters covering financial forecasting and trade credit (18 and 19) allow students\nto see how changing assumptions and variables impact financial decision-making. Chapters 13 and 14\n(statistical and regression analysis, respectively) also include brief sections about the R software\n(https://openstax.org/r/r-software) package to promote further interest in trends in data science.\nTeaching Plan Options\nPrinciples of Finance includes chapters on basic, applied, and integrative finance topics as well as key concepts\nfrom prerequisite financial accounting, quantitative methods (statistics), and economics courses. The chapters\non prerequisite topics highlight examples relevant to finance students. For instructors with a limited one-\nsemester schedule or whose students have solid knowledge of prerequisite disciplines, we recommend\nfocusing on the “core” chapters, as indicated in the following table of contents:\n1 Introduction to Finance\nCore\n2 Corporate Structure and Governance\nCore\n3 Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nExtension\n4 Accrual Accounting Process\nExtension\nTable 1\n2\nPreface\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n5 Financial Statements\nCore\n6 Measures of Financial Health\nCore\n7 Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nCore",

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and",

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students.

They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged.

Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities.

                    "answer": "Finance is a crucial part of our economy. It helps keep the economy running smoothly by allowing people to buy homes and pay for them over time. It also allows people to use cards or apps instead of cash, which is more convenient and safer. Additionally, a well-regulated and independent financial system is important to capital-based economies. There are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides a long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of financial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among the most important tools for advancement toward greater responsibility and remuneration. Government and work-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must take greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement."

The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short.

Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials.

In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular\ninstructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for\nmany followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a “pack of bike\nriders,” familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The\ncompany name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.\nPeloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public\nwith an initial public offering in September 2019. Foley and his friends had the idea that they were a\n“purposeful music company” and needed to touch on all aspects of the workout experience including the\n3\nCatherine Cote. “How and Why Managers Use Financial Statements.” Business Insights.

Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market.

The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges.

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm",

Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services.

Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and\nthey trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.\nTreasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where\ninvestors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills\nhas exceeded $75 billion.9\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as for inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to\n270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP\nmeans that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial\npaper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of\n2008.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue\ncommercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for\nCP.

Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of\nconsumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like\nthis: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment\nadviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my\ninvestments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13\nmillion!”\nAn important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and\nlong-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be\navailable? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?\nWhen saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of\ncompounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low\ntolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start\na holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you\nhave funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.\nAn intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation\nhome. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment\nreturns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term\ninvestments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.\nLong-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and\nthe luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater\nrisk and higher expected average annual rates of return.

This is why it is important to start saving and investing as early as possible, as this will give you the most time for compounding to take place."

Accountants\ntrack, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present\nare “book values” and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”\nMarket values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon\nSigns planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when\ncreating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have\nmultiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think\nabout the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay,\nwhile economic value is what you are willing to pay.\n30\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n1.1 What Is Finance?\nFinance is the study of the trade-off between risk and expected return.

Finance is\nresponsible for budgeting and forecasting. Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for\nmeeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or\nhave a claim against firm assets.\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\nMuch of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\nfor their stakeholders.\n1.4 Careers in Finance\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\nto manufacturing, to education.\n1.5 Markets and Participants\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an\nindividual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.",

However, it is still important to\nunderstand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.\nSole Proprietorships\nA proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of\nforming a business as a sole proprietor is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin\nconducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of\nbusiness organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:\n1.\nThey have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.\n1\nAaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings.

There are no separate\ntaxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report\nall their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.\n4.\nControlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated\nmanagerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.\nHowever, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable\nshortcomings:\n1.\nA sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the\nend, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in\nthe company’s formation.

                    "answer": "A sole proprietorship has the following four important advantages: 1. They have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form. 2. They are subject to relatively few government rules and regulations. 3. Taxation on sole proprietorships is far simpler than on other organizational forms. There are no separate taxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report all their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns. 4. Controlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated managerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions."

If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management.

This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.",

This can result in lower tax rates than a sole proprietorship or corporation.\n3. Shared responsibilities: Partners share the responsibilities of running the business, which can help distribute the workload and make decisions more efficiently.\n4.

For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid.

The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase",

Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.\nOften, Congress enacts laws and regulations in response to major economic or other highly visible events.\nFollowing the great market crash of 1929, the US government created a new set of rules and regulations\ngoverning the issuing and trading of securities, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934. The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\nand regulations.\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors.

However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long\nway to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most\nbusinesses and organizations around the world.\nBoard members face many challenges in making decisions effectively and efficiently as possible. Because of\nsuch challenges, the potential objective of diversifying the boardroom competes with other worthy topics and\nobjectives such as improving cybersecurity, advancing customer service, identifying and reducing risk,\nimproving community relations, and positioning strategically within an industry.

In the field of corporate finance, agency problems are often related to a conflict of interest\nbetween the management of a company and its shareholders.\nFor many years, this has been a very common problem that has been seen in nearly every kind of organization,\nirrespective of it being a church, a club, a not-for-profit organization, a multinational corporation, or any other\ngovernment agency or institution.

This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate\nactions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,\nand ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\nInvestors versus Creditors\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\npossible default.\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\nto company bond issues.

As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies.

The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for\nsweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30. At a price of $30, the quantity demanded of 20 sweatshirts\nequals the quantity supplied of 20 sweatshirts.\nFigure 3.6 Graph of Demand and Supply for Sweatshirts\nChanges in Equilibrium Price\nA price that is either too high (above the equilibrium price) or too low (below the equilibrium price) is not\nsustainable in a competitive market. Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either\nsupply or demand changes.\nIf supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as in Figure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will\nfall. With the original supply curve, Supply1, the equilibrium price was $15; quantity demanded and quantity\nsupplied were both 30 pizzas at that price.

This new equilibrium is associated with a quantity demanded of 40 pizzas and a quantity supplied of 40\npizzas.\nFigure 3.7 Supply Curve Changes When Supply Increases An increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and an increase\nin quantity demanded.\nIt is important to note that the demand curve in Figure 3.7 does not move. In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement an increase in quantity demanded.\nDistinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an\nincrease in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.\nEquilibrium price will also fall if demand falls. Remember that a decrease in demand is represented as a shift\nof the demand curve inward to the left.

If you would like to compare the purchasing power\nof a dollar amount in two different time periods, you can use the CPI Inflation Calculator\n(https://openstax.org/r/cpi-inflation-calculator). You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n77\ndelivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows\neconomists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a\ntypical family’s purchases.\nIn an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods\npurchased and the purchasing habits of families, Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon founded the Billion\nPrices Project. Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world. The Billion Prices Project website\n(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project) provides measures for inflation using this data as well as\nresearch papers regarding macroeconomic research.\nHistorical Trends in the Inflation Rate\nInflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed in Figure 3.10.

Purchases are divided\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\nexports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,\ncups of coffee, and clothing. Consumption expenditure accounts for about two-thirds of the US GDP.4\nInvestment spending refers primarily to purchases by businesses. It is important to note that in this context,\nthe term investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial securities. Instead, the\nterm refers to purchasing new capital goods, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment, that will be used\nto produce other goods.

Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico.

Either an increase in the demand\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\nCurrency Depreciation\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was\n, it\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\ndepreciate.\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\nExchange Rate Risk\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk.

As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\nexposure.

An\nindex helps compare the level of a variable at one point in time relative to another point in time. Indexes are\noften used when movement over time is more important than the absolute level of the variable at any one\npoint in time.\nEarlier in this chapter, we looked at the rate of change in the CPI to measure the rate of inflation. In its raw\nform, the CPI is an index. Remember that the CPI is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods. When\nthe index is created, the total cost of the market basket, whether it is $300 or $950, is irrelevant. What\neconomists are interested in is the magnitude of the difference in cost of the same market basket at a later\ndate.\nIn order to focus on the change over time, a base year is identified.

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency.

Emma loves the details of debits,\ncredits, and “all that other accounting jargon,” as Sam put it. She knows that while not everyone enjoys the\ndetails or understands them, they do play a big role in the timing and accuracy of financial statements. “Yeah,\nyeah, Sam, accounting isn’t always easy or fun, but it’s important. The financial statements you will use in\nfinance are a part of the foundation for many decisions. They are an important tool. Even though you don’t\nhave to create financial statements in a finance role, it’s still necessary to understand the accounting principles\nthey are based on.

While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\n104\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSeptember rather than in August.

At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\nThe Accounting Equation\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance.

First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\ndegree pursued.\nSolution:\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\nsystems), and sports equipment.

In\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned.

The American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\nrevenue recognition.\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until\ncustomer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you\nrecognize revenue?\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\ngovernment.\nExpense Recognition\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers.

Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it\nis expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs\nover its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s\nfinancial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in\nexpenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense\nrecognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the\nrevenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over\nthe years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.\nAs stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated\ncosts on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,\nthey will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry in Figure 4.8).\nFigure 4.8 Journal Entry for Machine/Cash\nWhen capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This\nincludes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.\nFor example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the\nland would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.\nOver time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the\nasset.\n3\nIn the Chapter 4 financial statements, a number contained within parentheses is a negative number, such as the “Accumulated",

If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\ntypically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense.

Depreciation\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\nestimated useful life.\nRecording the Initial Asset\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\nthe asset for operation should be included.

A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\nand increase annual net income.

The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life.

In this case,\nthe asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated\ndepreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet\nto show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense\nthrough depreciation.\nIt is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated.

It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\naccounting courses. Note that these methods are for accounting and reporting purposes. The IRS allows firms\nto use the same or different methods to depreciate assets in calculating taxable income.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFixed Assets\nYou work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a\nproduction and warehouse facility in Pennsylvania.

However, “management teams typically fail to invest either time or attention into\nmaking or periodically revisiting and revising reasonably supportable estimates of asset lives or salvage\nvalues, or the selection of depreciation methods, as prescribed by GAAP.”5 This failure is not an ethical\napproach to properly accounting for the use of assets.\nAccountants need to analyze depreciation of an asset over the entire useful life of the asset. As an asset\nsupports the cash flow of the organization, expensing its cost needs to be allocated, not just recorded as an\narbitrary calculation. An asset’s depreciation may change over its life according to its use. If asset depreciation\nis arbitrarily determined, the recorded “gains or losses on the disposition of depreciable property assets seen\nin financial statements”6 are not true best estimates. Due to operational changes, the depreciation expense\nneeds to be periodically reevaluated and adjusted.\nAny mischaracterization of asset usage is not proper GAAP and is not proper accrual accounting.

Additionally, it is considered to be the most accurate method for determining the value of an asset over its useful life. The double declining balance method is a more aggressive method of depreciation, and it may be more appropriate for certain types of assets, such as equipment or machinery that have a short useful life. However, for a long-lived asset like a building, the straight-line method is generally considered to be the most appropriate. In the case of McDonald’s, the straight-line method is likely to be the most appropriate method because it will result in a more accurate reflection of the asset’s true value over time."

In this section you’ll\nexplore key differences between cash flow, revenue, expense, profits, and losses.\nCalculating Profit and Loss\nNet income (net loss) is determined by comparing revenues and expenses. Net income is a result of revenues\n(inflows) being greater than expenses (outflows). A net loss occurs when expenses (outflows) are greater than\nrevenues (inflows). In accounting it is common to present net income in the following format:\nRecall that revenue is the value of goods and services a business provides to its customers and increases the\nvalue of the business. Expenses, on the other hand, are the costs of providing the goods and services and\ndecrease the value of the business. When revenues exceed expenses, companies have net income.

While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses.

The account is named after the symbol that is used to represent it, which is a T. The T-account is divided into two sides, with one side representing the debit side and the other side representing the credit side.

We will walk through each financial statement, its components, how they are connected, and how\nfinancial statement users understand each one.\nFinancial Statements\n5\n5 • Why It Matters\n129\n5.1\nThe Income Statement\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nOutline the purpose and importance of the income statement.\n•\nIdentify the structure and key elements of the income statement.\n•\nDiscuss the use of EBITDA as a measure of a company’s profit.\nFinancial information flows from one financial statement to the next. Thus, the statements are prepared in a\nspecific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\nrather than a net loss.\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\nfuture results.",

The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is\ncustomary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margin\ngross profit/sales.)

They must be equal. When Clear Lake records\nan expense of $1,500, it must also record the other half of that transaction.

Dividends are commonly in the form of cash, but dividends can be paid out in the form of stock or\nother assets as well.\nTo pay a cash dividend, the firm must have enough cash on hand and sufficient retained earnings. They cannot\npay out a dividend beyond the retained earnings available. Some companies issue shares of stock as a\ndividend rather than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has insufficient cash but wants to\nkeep its investors happy. When a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional shares of stock to\nexisting shareholders.\nA property dividend occurs when the firm pays out dividends in the form of something other than stock or\ncash, often one of their assets or something they hold in inventory. For example, Walt Disney Company may\nchoose to distribute tickets to visit its theme parks. A property dividend may be declared when a company\nwants to reward its investors but doesn’t have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold on to its existing\ncash for other investments.\nRemember, the retained earnings account reflects the cumulative earnings of a firm since they began\nbusiness, less dividends paid out to shareholders. This includes all forms of dividends (cash, stock, and other\nassets). Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares of stock that are outstanding.

FASB (Financial Accounting\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\nfixed assets).

The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these\nare liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an\nincrease to the statement.",

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task.

A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements.

This means that while sales\n152\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nincreased, so did cost of goods sold, but it increased at the same proportion as sales. No improvement or\ndecline occurred in the company’s cost of goods sold. The same is true for rent, depreciation, and utilities\nexpenses. One key item did change slightly as a percentage: salaries expense. The 2 percent decrease in\noperating income from the prior year’s 38 percent to the current year’s 36 percent was caused by the increase\nin salaries expense as a percentage of sales.\nNet income, however, only declined by 1 percent from 30 percent in the prior year to 29 percent in the current\nyear because interest expense dropped by 1 percent, offsetting the 2 percent increase in salaries expense.\nFigure 5.24 Common-Size Income Statement\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCommon-Size Income Statement\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

What can you\nlearn about the company’s recent performance in these areas? Has it improved or declined, or has it simply\nchanged incrementally with gross sales?\nOn the Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size balance sheet, we see that current assets remained at 80\npercent of total assets from the prior to current year (see Figure 5.25). The mix of current assets that comprise\nthat 80 percent changed only slightly with a 1 percent decrease in cash, 2 percent increase in accounts\nreceivable, 2 percent decrease in inventory, and no change in short-term investments. Noncurrent assets\nincludes only equipment. While the balance in the equipment account did change as a percentage of total\nassets, equipment remained the same at 20 percent.\nOn the debt and equity side of the balance sheet, however, there were a few percentage changes worth\nnoting. In the prior year, the balance sheet reflected 55 percent debt and 45 percent equity. In the current\nyear, that balance shifted to 60 percent debt and 40 percent equity. The firm did issue additional stock and\nshowed an increase in retained earnings, both totaling a $10,000 increase in equity.

Most financial statements are\nprepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to\narrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other\nnonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.\n5.2 The Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly\ndepict and support the accounting equation:\nA classified balance\nsheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nThe financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is\nneeded in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of\nthe balance sheet.\n5.4 The Statement of Owner’s Equity\nThe statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,",

Beginning balances are provided, and all key\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\nneeds for growth.\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.\n5.8 Reporting Financial Activity\nPublicly traded firms must file company and financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\non a regular basis. Key reports include the quarterly report, called a 10-Q, and the annual report, called a 10-K.\n158\n5 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual basis\naccounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned yet not\nnecessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily when\npaid\nassets",

The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\nearnings per share is\nBy removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to\ncommon shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to\npreferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While\na number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\nrequires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount\nappears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\nIn the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per\nshare is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout\nthe year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares\nis used on the denominator because of this fluctuation.

The company\nneeds to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,\ncompany revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:\nprofit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.\nProfit Margin\nProfit margin represents how much of sales revenue has translated into income. This ratio shows how much\nof each $1 of sales is returned as profit. The larger the ratio figure (the closer it gets to 1), the more of each\nsales dollar is returned as profit. The portion of the sales dollar not returned as profit goes toward expenses.\nThe formula for profit margin is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the profit margin in the current year is\nThis means that for every dollar of sales, $0.29 returns as profit.

Average total assets are\nfound by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the balance sheet.

                    "question": "price/earnings (P/E) ratio company’s stock price divided by the company’s earnings per share; indicates the amount investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings",
                    "answer": "The price/earnings (P/E) ratio is a financial ratio that sums up the relationship between a company’s stock price and its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio is used for valuing companies and to determine whether a company’s stock price is overvalued or undervalued. A high P/E ratio generally means that investors are paying a higher price for the stock than they would expect to pay based on current earnings. A low P/E ratio generally means that investors are paying a relatively low price for the stock compared to its earnings. The P/E ratio can be calculated by dividing the stock price by the EPS. For example, if a company’s stock price is $50 and its EPS is $2, the P/E ratio would be 25. This means that investors are paying $25 for every $1 of earnings. The P/E ratio can also be calculated by dividing the market value of the company’s equity by the company’s net income. For example, if a company’s market value of equity is $1 billion and its net income is $100 million, the P/E ratio would be 10. This means that investors are paying $10 for every $1 of net income."

                    "answer": "The profit margin is a financial ratio that measures how much of a company’s revenue is left over after all expenses have been paid. It is calculated by dividing net income by revenue. The profit margin is a key metric for investors and analysts because it provides a clear picture of a company’s profitability. A high profit margin means that a company is able to generate a lot of income from its sales. A low profit margin means that a company is not able to generate as much income from its sales. The profit margin can also be used to compare the profitability of different companies. For example, if two companies have the same revenue but one has a higher profit margin, then the company with the higher profit margin is more profitable."

It is calculated by dividing the company’s current assets (excluding inventory) by its current liabilities. A high quick ratio means that a company has a lot of liquid assets that can be used to pay off its debts. A low quick ratio means that a company may have trouble paying off its debts if its cash flow is not sufficient. The quick ratio is often used by investors and analysts to assess a company’s financial health."

A company is considered solvent if it has enough assets to cover its debts. Solvency is important because it indicates whether a company will be able to stay in business in the long term. If a company is not solvent, it may be forced to file for bankruptcy or close its doors. Solvency can be measured using a number of different financial ratios, such as the debt-to-equity ratio and the current ratio. A company with a high debt-to-equity ratio may be considered less solvent than a company with a low debt-to-equity ratio. Similarly, a company with a low current ratio may be considered less solvent than a company with a high current ratio."

It is calculated by dividing a company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense. The TIE ratio is a key metric for investors and analysts because it provides a clear picture of a company’s financial health. A high TIE ratio means that a company has a lot of earnings that can be used to pay its interest expense. A low TIE ratio means that a company may have trouble paying its interest expense if its earnings are not sufficient. The TIE ratio can also be used to compare the financial health of different companies.

These components provide a more detailed view of how a company is performing and can help analysts identify areas for improvement. Asset turnover measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate revenue. Profit margin measures the percentage of revenue that is left over after all expenses have been paid. Leverage measures the amount of debt a company is using to finance its operations. By analyzing these components, analysts can get a better understanding of how a company is using its resources and how it is performing financially."

In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value\ntomorrow.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will\npay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year\nfrom now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\nturns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is\n$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that\ntime. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the\nprincipal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\nBy taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a\ntotal value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to\n$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that\n$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss\ninterest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can\nconsider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds\nand/or charged to the borrower of these same funds.

Compound\ninterest is the term we use to refer to interest income earned in subsequent periods that is based on interest\nincome earned in prior periods. To put it simply, compound interest refers to interest that is earned on\ninterest. Here, it refers to the $1.60 of interest earned in the second year on the $40.00 of interest earned in\nthe first year. Therefore, at the end of two years, the account would have a total value of $1,081.60. This\nconsists of the original principal of $1,000 plus the $40.00 interest income earned in year one and the $41.60\ninterest income earned in year two.\nThe amount of money your friend would have in the account at the end of two years, $1,081.60, is referred to\nas the future value of the original $1,000 amount deposited today in an account that will earn 4% interest every\nyear.\nSimple interest applies to year 1 while compound interest or “interest on interest” applies to year 2. This is\ncalculated using the following method:\nSo, the total amount that would be in the account after two years, at 4% annual interest, would be\n.\nTo determine any future value of money in an interest-bearing account, we multiply the principal amount by 1\nplus the interest rate for each year the money remains in the account.

Unfortunately, you\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\ncost after six years?\nSolution:\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\nvalue of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn\nor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of\nor $105, in the account at the end of one\nyear.\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\nand five?\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n195\nUsing the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:\nHow the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding\nMelvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in\ninterest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future.

Using the future value formula\nthat we covered earlier, we would arrive at the following values: $105 at the end of year one, $110.25 at the\nend of year two, $115.76 at the end of year three, $121.55 at the end of year four, and $127.63 at the end of\nyear five.\nWith the numerical information, the timeline (at a 5% interest or growth rate) would look like Table 7.2:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n$100.00 $105.00 $110.25 $115.76 $121.55 $127.63\nTable 7.2\nUsing timelines to lay out TVM problems becomes more and more valuable as problems become more\ncomplex.

This is because most financial calculators\n(and spreadsheets) follow something called the cash flow sign convention, which is a way for calculators and\nspreadsheets to keep the relative direction of the cash flow straight. Positive numbers are used to represent\ncash inflows, and negative numbers should always be used for cash outflows.\nIn this example, the $1,000 is an investment that requires a cash outflow. For this reason, -1000 is entered as\nthe present value, as you will be essentially handing this $1,000 to a bank or to someone else to initiate the\ntransaction. Conversely, the future value represents a cash inflow in four years’ time. This is why the calculator\ngenerates a positive 1,125.51 as the end result of this calculation.\nHad you entered the present value of $1,000 as a positive number, there would have been no real concern, but\nthe ending future value answer would have been returned expressed as a negative number. This would be\ncorrect had you borrowed $1,000 today (cash inflow) and agreed to repay $1,125.51 (cash outflow) four years\nfrom now. Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the -- (minus) key).\nFor example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the +|-\n+|- key instead of the minus key. If you\nenter 1000 and then hit the +|-\n+|- key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.\nAn important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a\nproblem without needing to reenter all of the other data.

As an example, in the spreadsheet\nshown in Figure 7.3, we calculated that the future value of $100 five years from now at a 5% interest rate would\nbe $127.63. By reversing this process, we can safely state that $127.63 received five years from now with a 5%\ninterest (or discount) rate would have a value of just $100 today. Thus, $100 is its present value. In Excel, the\nPV function is used to determine present value (see Figure 7.7).\nFigure 7.7 Using the PV Function in Excel\nThe formula in cell E1 uses cell references in a similar fashion to our FV example spreadsheet above. Also\nsimilar to our earlier example is the hard-coded formula for this calculation, which is shown in cell E6.

The discount rate refers to\nthe annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this\ndiscount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing\nthe FV equation, we can turn\ninto\nwhich is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest\nfactor (PVIF).

However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending\nmoney later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing\npower of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move\ninto the future.\nMost investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a\npayment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general\nprices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of\nnormal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value\nof financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\nmay be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than\ninflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.\nConversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\nas time goes by under such conditions.\nThe Impact of Inflation on TVM\nThe difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the\neffects of inflation.

However, if the Federal Reserve increases the money supply too much, then this will have the effect of causing inflation to increase. The result of inflation is that the value of money will decrease over time. Therefore, the impact of inflation on TVM is that it can cause the value of money to decrease over time. This can be seen by the fact that the value of money is less now than it was in the past. This is because the value of money is decreasing over time due to inflation.

However, investors who save\nfor future consumption but leave their money uninvested or underinvested in low-interest-bearing accounts\nwill essentially lose value from their financial assets because each of their future dollars will be worth less,\ncarrying less purchasing power when they end up needing it for use. This relationship of saving and planning\nfor the future is one of the most important reasons to understand the concept of the time value of money.\nNominal versus Real Interest Rates\nOne of the main problems of allowing inflation to determine interest rates is that current interest rates are\nactually nominal interest rates. Nominal rates are “stated,” not adjusted for the effects of inflation. In order to\ndetermine more practical real interest rates, the original nominal rate must be adjusted using an inflation\nrate, such as those that are calculated and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics within the consumer\nprice index (CPI).\nA concept referred to as the Fisher effect, named for economist Irving Fisher, describes the relationship\nbetween inflation and the nominal and real interest rates and is expressed using the following formula:\nwhere i is the nominal interest rate, R is the real interest rate, and h is the expected inflation rate.\nAn example of the Fisher effect would be seen in the case of a bond investor who is expecting a real interest\nrate of return of 6% on the bond, in an economy that is experiencing an expected inflation rate of 2%.

It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples",

This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n.

Note that we represent r as the interest paid per period\nand n as the number\nof periods (12 months in a year;\n) rather than the number of years, which is only one.\nContinuing with our example, that same $1,000 in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four\ntimes a year, would grow to\nin one year. Note that this final amount ends up\nbeing greater than the annually compounded future value of $1,060.00 and slightly less than the monthly\n218\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompounded future value of $1.061.67, which would appear to make logical sense.\nThe total differences in future values among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding in these examples\nare insignificant, amounting to less than $1.70 in total. However, when working with larger amounts, higher\ninterest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms, compounding periods and frequency\nbecome far more important and can generate some exceptionally large differences in future values.\nTen million dollars at 12% growth for one year and compounded annually amounts to\n, while 10 million dollars on the same terms but compounded quarterly will\nproduce\n.

A good\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in\nor\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only\n, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\nInvesting and Risk\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.\nRisk and return are the factors that will cause a rational person to believe that a dollar risked should end up\nearning more than that single dollar.\nTo summarize, the concept of the time value of money and the related TVM formulas are extremely important\nbecause they can be used in different circumstances to help investors and savers understand the value of their\nmoney today relative to its earning potential in the future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that\ninflation has on your money and why saving your money early can help increase the value of your savings",

Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\nThe idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.\nTVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the\nfuture. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money\nearly can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects\nof inflation.

An old adage in finance claims, “If you aren’t in control of\nyour money, your money is controlling you.” Fortunately, learning to manage your money is not difficult if\nyou’re disciplined and understand some simple techniques. For example, several years ago, the author was\nnegotiating for a three-year auto loan from a well-known regional dealer, who was offering an interest rate of\n2%. When the manager left the room for a few minutes, we pulled out a financial calculator and proved in less\nthan a minute that the actual interest rate in the payments he was proposing was nearly double the quoted\nand advertised rate.\nIn addition to understanding how the loan process works, which improves your negotiation skills when\nborrowing, businesses and individuals can better control their investments by understanding basic rules of\nfinance, particularly as seen in this and the preceding chapter. Assume you pledge to invest $1,000 per year at\n5% return per year and are curious about how much you will have accumulated by age 60. If you begin at age\n30, you will have $69,760; if you begin at age 20, you will have $126,840. Can the extra 10 years make that much\nof a difference? We’ll see that indeed they can, and the calculations required to prove it can take less than two\nminutes.",

We begin with the illustration of a perpetuity.\nWhat Is a Perpetuity?\nA perpetuity is a series of payments or receipts that continues forever, or perpetually. One of the best ways to\nanalyze the basics of an annuity (the stream of payments to be paid or received in the future) is by starting\nwith a perpetuity. The most common examples of perpetuities in the author’s experience are college chair\nendowments and preferred stock.\nIf you gift $1,500,000 to a college to name a professor’s chair for your family, you might specify that the money\nmust be held in perpetuity and invested by the college to yield a fixed 3%. The college will take those proceeds\nof the investment, leaving your original $1,500,000 intact, and use the annual interest of $45,000 to fund a\nportion of the professor’s salary.\nAnother common example is preferred stock. Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%\ndividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out\n$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of\ncontinuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in\nperpetuity.\nTo place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one\nshare of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that\none share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But\nbe careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but the required rate of return, the “market\nrate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk.

Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity? Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a",

The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\ninterest from past periods.\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we\ndeposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the\nbeginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at\nthe end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity.

We will look at an alternative to ordinary annuities\nlater. How much money do we need in our fund today to accomplish this stream of payments if our remaining\nbalance will always be earning 8% annually? Although we’ll gradually deplete the fund as we withdraw\nperiodic payments of the same amount, whatever funds remain in the account will always be earning interest.\n8.2 • Annuities\n231\nBefore we investigate a formula to calculate this amount, we can illustrate the objective: determining the\npresent value of this future stream of payments, either manually or using Microsoft Excel. We can take each of\nthe five payments of $25,000 and discount them to today’s value using the simple present value formula:\nwhere FV is the future value, PV is the present value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nFor example, the first $25,000 is discounted by the equation as follows:\nProof that $23,148.15 will grow to $25,000 in one year at 8% interest:\nIf we use this same method for each of the five years, increasing the exponent n for each year, we see the\nresult in Table 8.2.\nYear\nCalculation\nResult\n1\n$23,148.15\n2\n$21,433.47\n3\n$19,846.81\n4\n$18,375.75\n5\n$17,014.58\nTOTAL\n$99,818.76\nTable 8.2 Present Value of Future Payments\nWe begin with the amount calculated in our table, $99,818.76. Before any money is withdrawn, a year’s worth\nof interest at 8% is compounded and added to our balance. Then our first $25,000 is withdrawn, leaving us\nwith $82,804.26. This process continues until the end of five years, when, aside from a minor rounding\ndifference, the fund has “done its job” and is equal to zero. However, we can make this simpler. Because each\npayment withdrawn (or added, as we will see later) is the same, we can calculate the present value of an\nannuity in one step using an equation. Rather than the multiple steps above, we will use the following\nequation:\nwhere PVa is the present value of the annuity and PYMT is the amount of one payment.\nIn this example, PYMT is $25,000 at the end of each of five years.

It’s important to note that rounding differences can\nbecome significant when dealing with larger multipliers, as in the financing of a multimillion-dollar machine or\nfacility. In this text, we will ignore them.\nIn conclusion, five payments of $25,000, or $125,000 in total, can be funded today with $99,817.81, with the\ndifference being obtained from interest always accumulating on the remaining balance at 8%. The running\nbalance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and\nsubtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year. In the last (fifth) year, just enough\ninterest will accrue to bring the balance to the $25,000 needed to complete the fifth payment.\nA common use of the PVa is with large-money lotteries. Let’s assume you win the North Dakota Lottery for\n$1.2 million, and they offer you $120,000 per year for 10 years, beginning one year from today. We will ignore\ntaxes and other nonmathematical considerations throughout these discussions and problems. The Lottery\nCommission will likely contact you with an alternative: would you like to accept that stream of payments … or\nwould you like to accept a lump sum of $787,000 right now instead? Can you complete a money-based\nanalysis of these alternatives? Based purely on the dollars, no, you cannot. The reason is that you can’t\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\nmoney. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives\non the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission",

That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as\ntaxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.\n8.2 • Annuities\n233\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nEarlier, we defined an ordinary annuity. A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,",

We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,\nlet’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because\nwe’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a\nlarger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to\nstart compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as\nfollows:\nWhether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger\nthan that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\norder of operations:\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\namount.\nWe notice several things:\n1.\nThe formula must change because the annual payment is subtracted first, prior to the calculation of\nannual interest.\n2.\nWe accomplish the same result, aside from an insignificant rounding difference: the fund is depleted once\nthe last payment is withdrawn.\n3.\nThe last payment is withdrawn on the first day of the final year, not the last. Therefore, no interest is\nearned during the fifth and final year.\n234\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo reinforce this, let’s use the same approach for our lottery example above. Reviewing the facts, you have a\nchoice of receiving 10 annual payments of your $1.2 million winnings, each worth $120,000, and you discount\nat a rate of 9%. The only difference is that this time, you can receive your first $120,000 right away; you don’t\nhave to wait a year. This is now an annuity due.

If you win a $450,000 settlement for an insurance claim, the opposing party may ask you to accept an\nannuity so that they can pay you in installments rather than a lump sum of cash.

Unsecured means that the loan\nis not secured by collateral but is instead based on the strong credit history of the borrower.\n•\nIn contrast, a secured personal loan has an asset backing up the unpaid amount, and if the consumer\ndefaults on the debt, the asset can be seized by the lender to satisfy their claim. A common example is an\nauto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the\nborrower’s car being repossessed.\n•\nA mortgage loan is another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even\n30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the\nborrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance\nremains on the debt.\n•\nStudent loans are borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a\nfinancial institution or the federal government. Interest rates on these loans are generally low and\nadvantageous, and repayment does not begin until after the borrower’s education is complete (or if they\ndrop below a certain level of time status, such as becoming a half-time student).\nCalculating Loan Payments Using Simple Amortization\nLoan amortization refers to a schedule of how and when a debt will be repaid with interest. As noted, we will\nfocus on fixed-rate debts, such as auto loans, personal loans with installment payments, or mortgages. Before\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into\nbusiness or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area of Time Value of Money I.\nWe’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a\nmonthly basis.

You will recall\nthat we solve for non-annual periods in the same way, with two adjustments: (1) we divide the annual interest\nrate by the number of periods in the year, and (2) we multiply the time periods by the number of those periods\nwithin a year. Therefore, in the case of monthly debt service, including interest and principal, we use 12\nperiods.\nGiven a three-year car loan at 6%, rather than using 6% and 3 periods in our formula, we would instead use\n0.5% (6% ÷ 12) and 36 periods (3 years × 12), and then apply the present value of an annuity formula in the\nsame way.

Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore\nthis bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to\ncompound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (see Table 8.6).\nMonth Interest Balance\n1,000.00\n1\n15.00 1,015.00\n2\n15.23 1,030.23\n3\n15.45 1,045.69\n4\n15.69 1,061.36\n5",

Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in\nfront of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers.

An indefinite stream of payments cannot be compounded into a future value, but it can be\ndiscounted to a present value, providing an opportunity to determine the amount an investor should be\nwilling to pay for a share of that stock.\n8.2 Annuities\nAn annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments that is expected to be paid or received. Calculations of future\nvalue or present value are commonly performed on these payment streams for a wide number of reasons in\nbusiness and personal financial analysis, as seen in the chapter focusing on single amounts, particularly in\nloan repayment. Annuities may be ordinary annuities, in which the first cash flow of a series occurs at the end\nof the first period, or annuities due, if the first cash flow occurs at the beginning point of the first period.\n8.3 Loan Amortization\nLoans are contracts between a lender and a borrower. Failure to observe the rules of that contract, such as\npayment of interest or repayment of the amount owed, can subject the borrower to substantial penalties as\nwell as damage to their credit. Loan agreements bearing a fixed rate of interest have a scheduled\namortization, or rate and time of repayments with interest. Several types of business and personal loans were\ndescribed.\n8.4 Stated versus Effective Rates\nFor a borrower to understand the true cost of financing, they must be familiar with interannual compounding,\nwhich can cause a stated interest rate that appears to be annual to actually be higher. The effective rate of\ninterest was demonstrated to understand that true cost.\n8.5 Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\nThe use of two tools for managing and understanding the time value of money and its many applications was\ndiscussed: a professional financial calculator and the popular Microsoft Office Suite spreadsheet application\nExcel.\nKey Terms\nannuity",

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to",

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments",

Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•",

It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nannually. However, if a bond pays interest on a semiannual or quarterly basis, the coupon rate will have to\nbe divided by 2 or 4, respectively, to convert the stated annual rate to the correct periodic rate. In our\nexample, coupons are paid annually, so the periodic or annual interest that is paid is equal to\n. You may notice that because these payments are the same amount and made at\nregular intervals, they constitute an annuity stream (refer to Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple\nPayments.\n•\nMaturity date: The maturity date is the expiration date of the bond, or the point in time when the term of\na bond comes to an end. On the maturity date, the issuer will make the final interest or coupon payment\non the bond and will also pay off its principal, or face value. In our example, the maturity date is at the end\nof the 20-year period.\n•\nYield to maturity (YTM): The YTM is essentially the discount rate used to bring the future cash flows of a\nbond into present value terms.

These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment.

The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3).

This is because they represent interest rates for different periods of time, maturities, or terms.\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called a yield curve. Essentially, the yield curve is a result of this plotting\nprocess and becomes a graphical representation of the term structure of interest rates. A yield curve will\nalways be constructed by showing the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or time periods on\nthe x-axis (see Figure 10.5).\nTo create a useful graph of the yield curve, interest rate yields should be computed for all government bonds\nat all remaining times to maturity. For example, the yields on all government bonds with a single year\nremaining until maturity should be calculated. This value is then plotted on the y-axis against the one-year\nterm on the x-axis.

The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-",

Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates.

If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded.

A perfect example of this is when energy giant Enron failed in 2001.\nAfter the collapse, investors correctly pointed out that a mere two months before this occurred, the\ncompany’s bonds were rated as investment grade and considered relatively safe, having little risk for\ninvestors.\nBackground on Enron\nFrom its formation in 1985 through the late 1990s, Enron grew to become an energy mega-conglomerate,\n6\nLawrence Delevingne. “The Drexel Collapse, 25 Years Later.” CNBC.

Reported revenues grew at an exceptional pace, Enron’s stock price continued to rise,\nand business was proceeding exceptionally well.\nHowever, things were not as they appeared on the surface. Enron’s financial statements were often very\nconfusing to shareholders and analysts. Additionally, Enron’s unscrupulous business practices included\nrevenue misstatements and other questionable accounting practices to indicate favorable financial\nperformance. On top of this, some of Enron’s speculative business ventures proved to be disastrous,\nresulting in substantial financial losses.\nInitial allegations against Enron also focused on the role of their public accountants, Arthur Andersen.\nAndersen was one of the Big Five accounting firms in the United States at that time and had served as\nEnron’s auditing firm for over 16 years. According to court documents, Enron and Arthur Andersen had\nimproperly categorized hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions as increases to the company’s\nshareholder equity. It was also later discovered that Andersen failed to follow generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) when considering Enron’s dealings with related partnerships. As a result,\nEnron was able to conceal some of its losses from the investing public. After investigation by the United\nStates Justice Department, the firm was indicted on obstruction of justice charges in March 2002. The\ncombination of all of these irregularities and issues resulted in the December 2, 2001, bankruptcy of the\ncorporation.7 It was later determined that the majority of these unethical issues had been perpetuated with\nthe indirect knowledge or even, in some cases, by the direct actions of the board of directors or senior\noperational management of the company.\nSpecifics and Enron’s Bond Ratings\nOn October 27, 2001, the company began buying back all its commercial paper, valued at around $3.3\nbillion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron’s supply of cash. On November 8, Enron announced\nthat restatements to its financial statements for the years 1997–2000 were necessary to correct several\naccounting violations. However, by November 28, 2001, credit rating agencies had reduced Enron’s bond\nrating to junk status.8\nOther Examples of Significant Bond Ratings Downgrades\nSome companies that have recently experienced downgrades (or potential downgrades) to their credit and",

This was due to the fact that Enron had been involved in a number of unethical practices, such as accounting fraud and hiding losses. As a result, investors lost confidence in the company and its ability to pay back its debt, which led to the downgrade."

However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they",

So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they\nwould earn by only investing in short-term bonds. Also, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced\nby the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making the bond ladder less risky than an investment\nthat only included long-term bonds.\nIt is easy to see why bond laddering has become such a highly adopted bond investment strategy with\ninvestors ranging from novice to the most well-seasoned and experienced.\nInterest Rate Movements and Bond Prices\nWe now know that when investors buy bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are lending money\nto bond-issuing firms or governments. In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated\ncoupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.\nWe have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest\nrates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes",

This can lead to a loss of principal if the bond is called early or if the bond is not renewed at the end of its term.

However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by\ncompanies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate\nincome and eventual value for individual investors.\nWith common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will\nreceive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•",

When such complex\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses.

Because the stable growth\nrate is achieved in the second phase, after five years have passed, if we assume that the current year is 2021,\nwe can lay out the profile for this stock’s dividends through the year 2026, as per Figure 11.3.\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n329\nFigure 11.3 Profile of Stock Dividend through 2026\nStep 2:\nNext, we apply the DDM to determine the terminal value, or the value of the stock at the end of the five-year\nhigh-growth phase and the beginning of the second, lower growth-phase.\nWe can apply the DDM formula at any point in time, but in this example, we are working with a stock that has\nconstant growth in dividends for five years and then decreases to a lower growth rate in its secondary phase.\nBecause of this timing and dividend structure, we calculate the value of the stock five years from now, or the\nterminal value. Again, this is calculated at the end of the high-growth phase, in 2026. By applying the constant\ngrowth DDM formula, we arrive at the following:\nThe terminal value can be calculated by applying the DDM formula in Excel, as seen in Figure 11.4 and Figure\n11.5.

The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model\nwith a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales\nof the stock.\nAlthough this point may be subtle, what we have just shown is that a stock’s price is the present value of its\nfuture dividend stream.

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset.

It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. Examples of such companies include Facebook, Amazon,\nGoogle, Biogen, and Monster Beverage. The DCF model differs from the dividend discount models we covered\nearlier, as DDM methodologies are almost entirely based on a stock’s periodic dividends.\nThe DCF model is an absolute valuation model, meaning that it does not involve comparisons with other firms\nwithin any specific industry but instead uses objective data to evaluate a company on a stand-alone basis. The\nDCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows, determining the present value of the entire organization and\nthen working this down to the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\nThis highly regarded methodology is the evaluation tool of choice for experienced financial analysts when\nevaluating companies and their common stock. Many analysts prefer DCF methods of valuation because these\nare based on a company’s cash flows, which are far less easily manipulated through accounting treatments\nthan revenues or bottom-line earnings.\nThe DCF model formula in its mathematical form is presented below:\nwhere CF1 is the estimated cash flow in year 1, CF2 is the estimated cash flow in year 2, and so on; TCF is the\nterminal cash flow, or expected cash flow from the ending asset sale; r is the discount rate or required rate of\nreturn; g is the anticipated growth rate of the cash flow; and n is the number of years covered in the model.\nApplying the DCF Model\nWe can apply the DCF model to an example to demonstrate this methodology and how the formula works.\nCalculate the value of Mayweather Inc. and its common stock based on the next six years of cash flow results.\nAssume that the discount rate (required rate of return) is 8%, Mayweather’s growth rate is 3%, and the\nterminal value (TCF) will be two and one-half times the discounted value of the cash flow in year 6.\n11.3 • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\n341\nMayweather has a cash flow of $2.0 million in year 1, so its discounted cash flow after one year (CF1) is",

The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows, determining the present value of the entire organization and then working this down to the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization."

The only time a company would pay this par value to the\nshareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\n11.4 • Preferred Stock\n343\nFor example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future. It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant\ncash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of\nperpetuity.\nIt is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another\nform of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred\nstock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.\nDetermining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock\nWe can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the\nfollowing example. Oh-Well Heath Services Inc. has issued preferred stock that has a par value of $1,000 and\npays an annual dividend rate of 5%. If the market considers the risk of Oh-Well to warrant a 10% discount rate,\nwhat would be a fair market price for Oh-Well preferred stock?",

The SOES system has now\nbeen largely phased out with the emergence of all-electronic trading that increased transaction speed at ever\nhigher trading volumes.\nPublic access to the best available prices promotes operational efficiency. This speed in matching buyers and\nsellers at the best available price is strong evidence that the stock markets are operationally efficient.\nInformational Efficiency\nA second measure of efficiency is informational efficiency, or how quickly a source reflects comprehensive\ninformation in the available trading prices. A price is efficient if the market has used all available information\nto set it, which implies that stocks always trade at their fair value (see Figure 11.12). If an investor does not\nreceive the most current information, the prices are “stale”; therefore, they are at a trading disadvantage.\nFigure 11.12 Forms of Market Efficiency A market is efficient if it provides all information that is available.\nForms of Market Efficiency\nFinancial economists have devised three forms of market efficiency from an information perspective: weak\nform, semi-strong form, and strong form. These three forms constitute the efficient market hypothesis.\nBelievers in these three forms of efficient markets maintain, in varying degrees, that it is pointless to search\nfor undervalued stocks, sell stocks at inflated prices, or predict market trends.\nIn weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock’s price history and trading volume. It is useless\nto chart historical stock prices to predict future stock prices such that you can identify mispriced stocks and\nroutinely outperform the market. In other words, technical analysis cannot beat the market.

The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\n11.4 Preferred Stock\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, there is no maturity date, and consequently, there\nis no final payment of the par value. The term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past\n(if cumulative) and present dividends before common shareholders receive any cash dividends.\n11.5 Efficient Markets\nEfficient markets are markets in which costs are minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. There\nare two forms of efficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency. Operational efficiency concerns\nthe speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available price. Informational efficiency\nconcerns how quickly a source reflects comprehensive information in the available trading prices. Financial",

Investors\ndecide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expect inflation to affect the value of the\nfixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\nGovernment Bond Markets\nIn the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities\nin the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.\nWe learned in Bonds and Bond Valuation that the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to\nraise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,\nas the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.\nThe debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online at https://www.usdebtclock.org/\n(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).\nTreasury notes (T-notes) are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years.

Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding.

T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of\n20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8\ntrillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.\nIn 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument, Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once\nper month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the\nsecurity and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts\nmonthly in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of\nthe principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a\ntotal outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury\nborrowing we have discussed.3\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (munis). Local\nborrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,\nmunis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on\nthe perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-\nfree. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\nThere are two primary types of municipal bonds: revenue bonds and general obligation (GO) bonds.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and\nessentially merge with the target. Underpricing of IPOs is well documented,12 and the owners of a private\ncompany going public do not capture the significant increase in stock price that frequently occurs in the\nmonths following an IPO.\nA SPAC offering allows the private firm owners to negotiate for a better price. A July 2020 study from\nRenaissance Capital reports that “of 223 SPAC IPOs conducted from the start of 2015 through July 2020, 89\nhave completed mergers and taken a company public.” According to the study, of those 89 mergers, “the\ncommon shares have delivered an average loss of 18.8% and a median return of minus 36.1%. That compares\nwith the average after-market return from traditional IPOs of 37.2%” over the same time period.13\nSequence of Trade Execution\nInvestors who wish to trade stocks (buy or sell) execute trades via a broker.

Baseball\npundit Sam Ewing noted, “Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten-dollar haircut you used to get\nfor five dollars when you had hair.”15 If what you have earned on your investments fails to keep up with\nchanging prices, you may have a larger portfolio with less purchasing power.\nExpected versus Actual Inflation\nInflation occurs when things cost more and your money buys less today than it did yesterday. It is\nunderstandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the\nprimary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.\nHowever, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others\nat the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical\nevidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that\nmatch the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are\nwilling to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation\nexceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the\nloan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate.

After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, Yellen later\nattended Yale University and was the only woman in her 1971 PhD graduating class in economics. Men have\nlong dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.\nMotivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen\nrealized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary\npeople. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record. During her four-year tenure, the rate of unemployment\ndecreased by more than 2.5%, and employment increased in every month of her term.

For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000.

To calculate these statistical results in Excel, enter the data values in a column.\nLet’s assume the data values are placed in cells A2 through A11. In any cell, type the Excel command\n=AVERAGE(A2:A11) and press enter. Excel will calculate the arithmetic mean in this cell. Then, in any other cell,\ntype the Excel command =STDEV.S(A2:A11) and press enter. Excel will calculate the sample standard deviation\nin this cell. Figure 13.2 shows the mean and standard deviation for the 10 ages.\nFigure 13.2 Mean and Standard Deviation in Excel.\nRelationship between Standard Deviation and Variance\nIn the formulas shown above for variance and standard deviation, notice that the variance is the square of the\nstandard deviation, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nOnce you have calculated one of these values, you can directly calculate the other value. For example, if you\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.\nIn the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by\ncalculating the square root of the variance. For example, if the variance of a data set is known to be 31.36, then\nthe standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of 31.36, which is 5.6.\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n389\nOne disadvantage of using the variance is that the variance is measured in square units, which are different\nfrom the units in the data set. For example, if the data set consists of ages measured in years, then the\nvariance would be measured in years squared, which can be confusing. The standard deviation is measured in\nthe same units as the original data set, and thus the standard deviation is used more commonly than the\nvariance to measure the spread of a data set.\n13.3\nMeasures of Position\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate z-scores for a measurement.\n•\nDefine and calculate quartiles and percentiles for a data set.\n•\nUse quartiles as a method to detect outliers in a data set.\nz-Scores",

The mean is the same\nas the median, which is the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about\n. As the notation\nindicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation.

A change in\ncauses\nthe graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability\ndistributions.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the normal distribution, we find specific areas under the normal\ncurve, and this is further discussed in Apply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts. For example,\nsuppose that at a financial consulting company, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with a standard\ndeviation of $7,500. A normal curve can be drawn to represent this scenario, in which the mean of $60,000\nwould be plotted on the horizontal axis, corresponding to the peak of the curve. Then, to find the probability\nthat an employee earns more than $75,000, you would calculate the area under the normal curve to the right\nof the data value $75,000.\nExcel uses the following command to find the area under the normal curve to the left of a specified value:\n=NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE)\nFor example, at the financial consulting company mentioned above, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with\na standard deviation of $7,500.

One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,\nQ3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles\ndivide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.\n13.4 Statistical Distributions\nA frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to\norganize and tabulate the data in a summarized way. Once a frequency distribution is generated, it can be\nused to create graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set. The normal distribution has two\nparameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,\n, and the standard deviation,\n. The exponential\ndistribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.\n13.5 Probability Distributions\nA probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. In many\nfinancial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. When analyzing distributions that\nfollow a normal distribution, probabilities can be calculated by finding the area under the graph of the normal\ncurve.\n13.6 Data Visualization and Graphical Displays\nData visualization refers to the use of graphical displays to summarize a data set to help to interpret patterns\nand trends in the data. Univariate data refers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute,\nsuch as salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\nseveral types of graphs. The type of graph to be used for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the\ndata and the purpose of the graph. Examples of graphs for univariate data include line graphs, bar graphs,\nand histograms. Bivariate data refers to paired data where each value of one variable is paired with a value of",

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval.

The expected value method assumes that the experiment\nis conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method.

There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation. As the value of x gets further and further from the (x, y) point\ncorresponding to the mean value of x and the mean value of y, the width of the estimated interval around the\npoint estimate increases. Choosing values of x beyond the range of the data used to estimate the equation\nposes an even greater danger of creating estimates with little use, very large intervals, and risk of error.

Many typical applications involve\ndetermining if there is a correlation between various stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the DJIA, and\nthe Russell 2000 index. The procedure is to first generate a scatter plot to determine if a visual trend is\nobserved, then calculate a correlation coefficient and check for significance. If the correlation coefficient is\nsignificant, a linear model can then be generated and used for predictions.\n14.5 Predictions and Prediction Intervals\nA key aspect of generating the linear regression model is to then use the model for predictions, provided that\nthe correlation is significant. To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute\nthe value of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent\nvariable (y).

Investors are interested in both risk and return\nbecause understanding one without the other is really meaningless. In terms of investment, the concept of\nreturn is fairly straightforward; return is the benefit, or profit, the investor expects from an expenditure. It is\nthe reward for investing—the reason an investment is made in the first place. However, no investment is a\nsure thing. The return may not be what the investor was expecting. This uncertainty about what the return will\nbe is referred to as risk.\nWe begin by looking at how to measure both risk and return when considering an individual asset, such as one\nstock.

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year. When we are looking at the historical\ndescription of the distribution of returns and want to predict what to expect in a particular year, the arithmetic\naverage is the relevant calculation.\nMeasuring Risk\nAlthough the arithmetic average return for Delta Airlines (DAL) for 2011–2020 was 22.4%, there is not a year in\nwhich the return was exactly 22.4%. In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.\nLooking at the yearly returns in Table 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL.

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

Geopolitical events, major storms, and pandemics can also impact the\nentire market. Investors in stocks cannot avoid this type of risk. This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that\ninvestors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.\nIn addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,4 the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as\nthe number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration in this\nsubsequent article by Statman (https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman) for context). Increasing the size\nof the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio\nincreases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How\nmany stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all\nfinancial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification\nthan a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients. A portfolio that consists of American Airlines,\nSpirit Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Jet Blue, along with a few other stocks, is\nnot very diversified because of the heavy concentration in the airline industry. The term diversified portfolio is\na relative concept, but the average investor can create a reasonably diversified portfolio with approximately a\ndozen stocks.\n15.3\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine risk premium.\n•\nExplain the concept of beta.\n•\nCompute the required return of a security using the CAPM.\nRisk-Free Rate\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a financial theory based on the idea that investors who are willing\nto hold stocks that have higher systematic risk should be rewarded more for taking on this market risk.

For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves.

It can also be used to calculate the beta for a stock. Historic stock price data for\nstocks you are interested in analyzing can easily be downloaded from sites such as Yahoo! Finance into Excel.\nThe examples in this section use monthly stock data from December 2017 to December 2020 from Yahoo!\nFinance.\nMonthly price data for AMZN (Amazon) is shown in column B of Figure 15.4. To begin, monthly returns must be\ncalculated from the price data using the formula\nThe ending prices shown in Figure 15.4 are the last price the stock traded for each month. Each month, the\nreturn is calculated under the assumption that you purchased the stock at the last trading price of the\nprevious month and sold at the last price of the current month. Thus, the return for January 2018 is calculated\nas\nThis is accomplished in Excel by placing the formula =(B3-B2)/B2 in cell C3. This formula can then be copied\ndown the spreadsheet through row C38. Now that each monthly return is in column C, you can calculate the\naverage of the monthly returns in cell C39 and the standard deviation of returns in cell C40.\n15.5 • Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\n467\nFigure 15.4 Calculating the Average Return and the Standard Deviation of Returns for AMZN (data source: Yahoo!

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy.

The cash flows from these projects are shown in Table 16.2. Both\nProject B and Project C have a payback period of five years.

This website on calculating the NPV on an MBA degree\n(https://openstax.org/r/calculating-the-NPV) lets you apply this concept in an educational setting. The\ninitial cost of the MBA includes both the dollars spent on tuition and the wages that a full-time student\ncould have earned if they were not in school. Why is it appropriate to include these forgone wages in the\ncalculation? What adjustments would students need to make to this analysis if they wanted to consider\nattending a part-time MBA program that allowed them to continue working while completing the program?\nNPV Profile\nThe NPV of a project depends on the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to\ntranslate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the\nembroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash\nflows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.\nTheoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In\nreality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an\napproximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall\nconclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and\nallows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.\nTo construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery\nmachine project using each of those discount rates. Table 16.6 below shows the NPV for several discount rates.\nNotice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate",

The IRR assumes that the cash flows are reinvested at the internal rate of\nreturn when they are received. This is a disadvantage of the IRR method. The firm may not be able to find any\nother projects with returns equal to a high-IRR project, so the company may not be able to reinvest at the IRR.\nThe reinvestment rate assumption becomes problematic when a company has several acceptable projects and\nis attempting to rank the projects.

If a company is simply deciding whether to accept a single\nproject, the reinvestment assumption limitation is not relevant.\nOverlooking Differences in Scale. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method to choose among various\nacceptable projects is that it ignores differences in scale.

The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\ndetermine the payback period.\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback\nperiod does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00)\n2,000.00\n4,000.00\n5,000.00\n5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\nDiscounted Cash Flow ($)\n(16,000)\n1,834.86\n3,366.72\n3,860.92\n3,542.13 3,249.66 2,981.34\nCumulative Discounted\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00) (14,165.14) (10,798.42) (6,937.50) (3,395.37) (145.72) 2,835.62\nTable 16.9\nWhen the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.\nThe discounted payback period would be\nyears.

However, another, more expensive embroidery\nmachine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-\nduty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more\nrevenue. The two embroidery machines are mutually exclusive projects. Mutually exclusive projects compete\nwith one another; purchasing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery\nmachine.\nTable 16.11 shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as\nwell as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but it will generate more cash inflows\nin years 3 through 6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to decisions to accept the projects. Also, both\nmachines have an IRR exceeding the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to decisions to accept\nthe projects.\nWhen considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the\nmanagers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to\ntake the project with the highest NPV. Remember that the goal is to choose projects that add value to the\ncompany. Because the NPV of a project is the estimate of how much value it will create, choosing the project",

This truck is smaller and will not be able to hold as many\nfrozen treats. However, the truck is newer, with lower mileage, and you estimate that you can use it for six\nyears. This newer truck will allow you to generate a cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The\nNPV of the newer truck is $80,658.\nBecause both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which\ntruck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its\nhigher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made\nsimply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV\nthan the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.\nThere are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life\nproject concludes, another, similar project will be available.\nReplacement Chain Approach\nWith the replacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal\nthe life of the long-life project.

To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last\nfor three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for\nthe next three years. In essence, you are comparing a six-year project with two consecutive three-year projects\nso that both options will generate cash inflows for six years.

The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\nestimate of what it expects.\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\nby the end of April.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReducing Capital Spending\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Figure 16.8 shows the\ncompleted spreadsheet.\nFigure 16.7 Function for Calculating IRR ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nFigure 16.8 Final Spreadsheet ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nUsing Excel to Create an NPV Profile\nFirms often do not know exactly what their cost of attracting capital is, so they must use estimates in their\ndecision-making. Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions.\nEspecially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to\nchanges in financing costs. Excel simplifies the creation of an NPV profile.\nMiddleton Manufacturing is considering installing solar panels to heat water and provide lighting throughout\nits plant. To do so will cost the company $800,000 this year. However, this upgrade will save the company an\nestimated $150,000 in electrical costs each year for the next 10 years. Constructing an NPV profile of this\nproject will allow Middleton to see how the NPV of the project changes with the cost of attracting funds.\n16.6 • Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions\n497\nFirst, the project cash flows must be placed in an Excel spreadsheet, as is shown in cells D2 through N2 in\nFigure 16.9. The company’s cost of funds is placed in cell B1; begin by putting in 10% for this rate. Next, the\nformula for NPV is placed in cell B6; cell B6 shows the NPV of the cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using the\nrate that is in cell B1.\nFor reference, compute IRR in cell B4. Calculating IRR is not necessary for creating the NPV profile. However, it\ngives a good reference point. Remember that if the IRR of a project is greater than the firm’s cost of attracting\ncapital, then the NPV will be positive; if the IRR of a project is less than the firm’s cost of attracting capital, then\nthe NPV will be negative.\nAn NPV profile is created by calculating the NPV of the project for a variety of possible costs of attracting\ncapital. In other words, you want to calculate NPV using the project cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using a\nvariety of discount rates in cell B1.

It is the time it takes the company to recoup its\ninitial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\nNPV is negative.\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\n16.4 Alternative Methods\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered.

The cost of common stock capital cannot be directly observed in the market; it must be estimated. Two\nprimary methods for estimating the cost of common stock capital are the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)\nand the constant dividend growth model.\nCAPM\nThe CAPM is based on using the firm’s systematic risk to estimate the expected returns that shareholders\nrequire to invest in the stock. According to the CAPM, the cost of equity (re) can be estimated using the\nformula\nFor example, suppose that Bluebonnet Industries has an equity beta of 1.3. Because the beta is greater than\n17.2 • The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\n511\none, the stock has more systematic risk than the average stock in the market. Assume that the rate on 10-year\nUS Treasury notes is 3% and serves as a proxy for the risk-free rate. If the long-run average return for the\nstock market is 11%, the market risk premium is\nthis means that people who invest in the\nstock market are rewarded for the risk they are taking by being paid 8% more than they would have been paid\nif they had purchased US Treasury notes. Bluebonnet Industries cost of equity capital can be estimated as\nConstant Dividend Growth Model\nThe constant dividend growth model provides an alternative method of calculating a company’s cost of equity.\nThe basic formula for the constant dividend growth model is\nThus, three things are needed to complete this calculation: the current stock price, what the dividend will be in\none year, and the growth rate of the dividend. The current price of the stock is easy to obtain by looking at the\nfinancial news. The other two items, the dividend next year and the growth rate of the dividend, will occur in\nthe future and at the current time are not known with certainty; these two items must be estimated.\nSuppose Bluebonnet paid a dividend of $1.50 per share to its shareholders last year.

However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be",

The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%.

This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company.

Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average.

The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to\ndetermine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target.

Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases.

This is called forecasting. Accounting and finance professionals use past performance\nalong with what they know about the business, its competitors, the economy, and the company’s plans for the\nfuture to assemble detailed financial forecasts. Forecasts are useful to many individuals for different reasons.\nA budget, a type of static forecast, helps accountants and managers see how their plans for the coming year\ncan be achieved. It outlines sales targets and how much can be spent on cost of goods sold and expenses to\nachieve the company’s bottom-line (net income) targets. Investors use financial forecasts to help guide their\ndecisions to buy, sell or hold stocks or to estimate future potential income through dividends. Perhaps most\nimportantly, for our purposes in finance, forecasts are used to help predict and manage cash flows.\nA business can have all the profit in the world at the end of the year, but if it doesn’t raise enough cash\n(liquidity) to pay the bills and pay its employees halfway through the year, it could still go bankrupt despite\nbeing profitable. Forecasting sales and expenses helps assemble a cash forecast—when sales will be collected\nand when expenses will be paid—so that financial managers can look forward far enough to have enough time\nto react accordingly and secure short- or long-term financing to meet gaps in cash flow.\nFinancial Forecasting\n18\n18 • Why It Matters\n535\n18.1\nThe Importance of Forecasting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss how to use financial statements in forecasting firm financials.\n•\nExplain why balance sheet items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\n•\nExplain why income statement items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\nIn this section, we will briefly review some of the basic elements of financial statements and how we can",

Financial forecasting is important to short-\nand long-term firm success. It helps a firm plan for the resources it will need, ensuring it will have enough cash\non hand at the right time to cover daily operations and capital expenditures. It helps the firm communicate its\nfuture potential and manage its shareholders’ expectations. It also helps management assess future risk and\nset plans in place to mitigate that risk.\nFinancial forecasting involves using historical data, analysis tools, and other information we can gather to\nmake an educated guess about the future financial performance of the firm. Historical figures provide a\nreasonable starting point. We use tools such as ratios, common size, and trend analysis to fine-tune our\nforecast. And finally, we assess what we know about the firm, its competitors, the economy, and anything else\nthat might impact performance and further fine-tune our forecast from there.\nIt’s important to take a moment to consider the role of ethics in forecasting. Ethics is a huge issue in the world\nof accounting and finance in general, and forecasting is no different. There can be tremendous pressure on\nmanagement to perform, to deliver certain levels of profit, and to meet shareholder expectations.\nForecasting, as you will learn throughout this chapter, is not an exact science. There is a great deal of\nsubjectivity that can come into play when forecasting sales and expenses. Ethical behavior is crucial in this\narea. Those who create forecasts must have a firm understanding of where their data comes from, how\nreliable it is, and whether or not their assumptions and projections are reasonably justified.\nFinancial Statement Foundations\nIn Financial Statements, you were introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods.

We will use Clear Lake’s company information and\nhistorical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that\nin this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast\nfinancial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to\nforecast their financial performance differently. We are demonstrating just one approach here.\nThe balance sheet shows all the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity at one point in time.

In Figure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake\nhad cash flow from operating activities of $53,600, cash used for investing activities of ($18,600), and cash\nused for financing activities of ($15,000).\nFigure 18.4 Statement of Cash Flows\nAnother key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is\nnecessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance. This means that total assets\n(what the company owns) must equal total liabilities and equity (what the company owes).\n538\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

This method relies on sales data, further highlighting why accuracy in forecasting\nsales is crucial.\nSales as the Driver\nA significant portion of a business’s costs are driven by how much it sells. Thus, the sales forecast is the\nnecessary first step in preparing a financial forecast. Common costs driven by sales include direct product\ncosts, direct labor costs, and other key variable costs (i.e., costs that vary proportionately to sales), such as\nsales commissions.\nLooking to the Past\nForecasting sales is not always an easy task, as no one knows the future. We can, however, use the information\nwe do have to forecast future sales with the greatest accuracy possible. Most firms start by looking at the past.\nA firm may look at past sales from a variety of prior periods. It’s common to look at the past 12 months to\nestimate the coming 12 months. Looking at 12 consecutive months helps identify seasonality of sales trends,\nwhat time of year sales tend to drop off and when they increase, possible sales spikes that might reoccur, and\nany other trends that tend to appear over a 12-month period. In Figure 18.7, we see Clear Lake’s sales by\nmonth for the past 12 months.\nPast data is often used in conjunction with probabilities and weighted average calculations derived from\nprobabilities. Though used in several areas of forecasting, this approach is particularly common in drafting the\nsales forecast. Using multiple scenarios and the probability of each scenario occurring is a common approach\nto estimating future sales.\nFigure 18.7 Historical Sales Data\nWe can see at first glance that sales remain fairly steady from January to April.

The length generally depends on the user’s needs. A one-\nyear forecast, broken down by month, is quite typical. A firm will often go through a formal budgeting process\nnear the end of its calendar or fiscal year to project financial plans and goals for the coming year. Once that is\ndone, a rolling financial forecast is then done monthly to adjust as time moves on, more information becomes\navailable, and circumstances change.\nTo be useful, the future forecast for financial planning purposes is almost always calculated as monthly\nincrements rather than one total figure for the next 12 months. Breaking the data down by month allows\nfinance managers to more clearly see fluctuations in cash flows in and out, identify potential gaps in cash flow,\nand plan ahead for their cash needs.\nForecasts can also be done for several years into the future. In fact, they commonly are. However, once the\nfirm is looking out beyond 12 months, it gets difficult to forecast items with a great degree of accuracy. Often,\nforecasts beyond a year will be completed only to quarterly or even annual figures rather than monthly.\nForecasts that far into the future are often strategic in nature, made more to communicate future plans for the\nfirm than for more detailed decision-making and cash flow planning.\nCommon-Size Financials\nAs we saw earlier in the chapter, common-size analysis involves using historical financial statements as a basis\nfor future forecasts.

Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we\nknow to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.\nMany items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,\ngather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the\npotential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an\nexhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.\n•\nIt has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in\nmonthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.\n•\nIt will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to\nbegin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s\nmonthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,\nand August.\n•\nThe company has just finished updating its employee compensation package. It goes into effect in January",

We will consider\nother data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.12 Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month\nThe first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income.

Thus, Clear Lake estimates its\nunearned revenue balance each month by taking the current month’s net sales from the forecasted income\nstatement and multiplying it by 50%.\nShort-term investments, notes payable, and common stock are not anticipated to change, so the current\nbalance is forecasted to remain the same for the next 12 months.\n548\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo forecast the ending balance for retained earnings for each month, managers add the monthly net income\nfrom the forecasted balance sheet to the prior balance and subtract a quarterly $10,000 dividend.\nOnce all of these accounts are completed, the balance sheet is out of balance. Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable.

Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods\nsold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, in Figure 18.16, we\nsee that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted\nincome statement.\nSalaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent. Utilities,\nlike accounts payable, are assumed to be paid within 30 days. Thus, the cash outflow for utilities is the utilities\nexpense for the prior month from the forecasted income statement.\nManagement intends to pay a quarterly dividend of $10,000.

For example, in Figure\n18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,\nwhich results in a cash deficit of $13,000.\nClear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess\ntheir monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,\nthe deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that\nthe company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March.

While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable.

In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement.

It’s a simple formula that subtracts sales\nreturns and allowances in B7 from gross sales in B4. Similar formulas are also found in B10 for gross\nmargin and B18 for net income.\n4.\nIn cell B9, we see a multiplication formula that multiplies sales from B4 by 0.5, or 50%. This is because\n554\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmanagement feels that cost of goods sold will remain the same as last year, in most quarters at least, and\nlast year’s percentage was 50%.\n5.\nRent, depreciation, and salaries are all simply typed in, as they are fixed expenses that remain the same as\nlast year.\n6.\nThe utilities calculation, found in cell B14, is somewhat similar to the sales calculation. The total utilities\nexpense from O14 is multiplied by the current month’s sales in B4 divided by the total annual sales in O4.\nThis spreads out the utility cost by month based on the percentage of annual sales.\nFigure 18.20 Forecasted Income Statement Formulas\nClear Lake’s forecasted balance sheet ties very closely to both the forecasted income statement and the prior\nyear’s income statement. In Figure 18.21, we see in C7 an addition formula using the sum of the current\nmonth and three months of prior sales as an estimate of the ending accounts receivable balance. The formula\nfor inventory is similar but forward looking. In C8, inventory is estimated by adding the cost of goods sold for\nthe current month and next three months from the forecasted income statement.\nTotal current assets in C10 is calculated with a SUM formula that adds together the values in all the selected\ncells.

To begin the year, in Figure 18.22, we see that the formula\nin B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three\nmonths prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected\nfrom customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.\nUtilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be\nthe utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement. Note that interest payments are\nassumed to be zero in January and February, but in March, the formula in D14 sums the interest expenses on\nthe forecasted income statement for January, February, and March. This is because interest is paid quarterly.\nFinally, note the formula in C4.

Managing cash, accounts receivable, and\ninventory while making optimal use of trade credit (accounts payable) makes for a business that meets its\noperating needs and pays its debts when due.\nWorking capital management is also critical during good times. Even though profits might be rising, a business\nwith growing demand for its products and services still needs to have working capital management tools to\npay its bills. Growth in sales and profits do not immediately mean sufficient cash flow, so planning ahead with\ntools such as a cash budget is key.\nThe Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\n19\n19 • Why It Matters\n565\n19.1\nWhat Is Working Capital?\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine working capital.\n•\nCalculate a firm’s operating cycle and cash cycle.\n•\nCompute inventory days, accounts receivable days, and accounts payable days.\nThe concept of business capital is often associated with the cash and assets (such as land and equipment) that\nthe owners contributed to the business. Early political economists like Adam Smith and Karl Marx identified\nthis concept of capital, along with labor and entrepreneurship, to be the factors of production.\nThat general idea of capital is important and critical to a company’s productive capacity. This chapter is about\na specific type of capital— working capital—that is just as important as long-term capital. Working capital\ndescribes the resources that are needed to meet the daily, weekly, and monthly operating cash flow needs.\nEmployees are paid out of working capital as well as cash from operations, the fulfillment of merchandise\norders is possible because of working capital, and the liquidity of a company hinges upon how well\nmanagement plans and controls working capital.\nUnderstanding working capital begins with the concept of current assets—those resources of a business that\nare cash, near cash, or expected to be turned into cash within a year through the normal operations of the\nbusiness. Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with\nterm gross working capital.",

Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with\nterm gross working capital.\nCash is needed to pay the bills and meet the payroll. Excess cash is invested in cash alternatives such as\nmarketable securities, creating liquidity that can be tapped when operating cash flow needs exceed the\namount of cash on hand (checking account balances). Investment in inventory is necessary to meet the\ndemand for products (sales), and if the firm extends credit to its customers so that a sale can be made, the\nbalance sheet will also show accounts receivable—a very common current asset that derives its value from the\nprobability that customers will pay their bills.\nWorking capital is often spoken about in two versions: gross working capital and net working capital. As was\npreviously stated, gross working capital is equivalent to current assets, particularly those that are cash, cash-\nlike, or will be converted to cash within a short period of time (i.e., in less than one year).\nNet working capital (NWC) is a more refined concept of working capital.

One very important aspect of working capital management is to provide enough cash to satisfy both\nmaturing short-term obligations and operational expenditures—keeping the company sufficiently liquid.\nIn summary, working capital management helps a company run smoothly and mitigates the risk of illiquidity.\nWell-run companies make effective use of current liabilities to finance an optimal level of current assets and\nmaintain sufficient cash balances to meet short-term operating goals and to satisfy short-term obligations.\nWorking capital management is accomplished through\n566\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\ncash management;\n•",

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.",

Industry averages can be aspirational, motivating management to set\nliquidity goals and best practices for working capital management.\nIt is common to think about working capital with a simple assumption: current assets are being “financed” by\ncurrent liabilities. However, such an assumption may be an oversimplification. Some level of current assets is\noften necessary to meet longer-term obligations, and in that way, you could think of some amount of current\nassets as a permanent based of working capital that may need to be financed with longer-term sources of\ncapital.\nThink of a company with seasonal business. During busy times, more working capital will be needed than\nduring certain other portions of the year, such as less busy times. But there will always be some level—a\npermanent base—of working capital needed. Think of it this way: the total working capital of many companies\nwill ebb and flow depending on many variables such as the operating cycle, production needs, and the growth\nof revenue. Therefore, working capital can be thought of as having a permanent base that is always needed\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n569\nand a total working capital amount that increases when activity levels (i.e., production and sales volume) are\nhigher (see Figure 19.2).\nThe Cash Cycle\nThe cash cycle, also called the cash conversion cycle, is the time period between when a business begins\nproduction and acquires resources from its suppliers (for example, acquisition of materials and other forms of\ninventory) and when it receives cash from its customers.

Financial managers monitor and analyze each component\nof the cash conversion cycle. Ideally, a company’s management should minimize the number of days it takes\nto convert inventory to cash while maximizing the amount of time it takes to pay suppliers.\nQuickly converting inventory to sales speeds up cash inflows and shortens the cash cycle, but it also could help\nreduce inventory losses as a result of obsolescence. Inventory becomes obsolete because of a variety of\nfactors including time—inventory that has not been sold for a long period of time and is not expected to be\nsold in the future has to be written down or written off according to accounting rules. Write-offs of inventory\ncan result in significant losses for a company. In the food business, inventory conversion periods take on great\nimportance because of spoilage of perishable goods; in retailing, seasonal items lose value the longer they\nstay on the shelves.\nVarious inventory management techniques are used to shorten production time in manufacturing, and in\nretailing, strategies are used to reduce the amount of time a product sits on the shelf or is stored in the\nwarehouse. Production techniques such as just-in-time inventory systems and marketing and pricing\nstrategies can have an impact on the number of days in the inventory conversion cycle.\nFor the receivables collection period, a relatively long receivables collection period means that the company is\nhaving trouble collecting cash from its customers and so whatever can be done to speed up collections while\nstill offering competitive credit terms should be pursued by financial managers. For example, companies that\nconverted paper invoicing to e-invoicing most likely reduce the average collection period by some number of\ndays, as it makes sense that if a bill is transmitted electronically, lag time is cut (no delays because of “snail\nmail”) and collections (payments back to the company from customers) may happen sooner.

In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a long operating cycle because of the\nproduction process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current\nratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much\nlower current ratios.\nIn recent years, Walmart Stores Inc.

The wait for the cash to flow into the company’s treasury\nfrom the collection of receivables and cash sales can be longer during tough times.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government made paycheck protection program (PPP) loans available\nto help alleviate working capital problems for small and large business when the economy slowed because of\nshutdowns and social distancing. And although 60 percent of the PPP loan proceeds were to go to cover\npayroll-related costs, 40 percent could be used to bolster working capital to meet rent, utilities costs, and some\ninterest expense while companies were “treading water”—waiting for positive cash flow to pick up under a\nrecovery.2\nIt isn’t just during downturns that working capital is strained. Growing companies, even if they are extremely\nprofitable, need additional working capital as they ramp up operations by acquiring raw materials, component\nparts, supplies, or other forms of inventory; hiring temporary or additional employees; and taking on new\nprojects. Whenever additional resources are needed, working capital is also needed.\nSome of the current assets and expenditures needed in a growing company may need to be financed from\nsources that are not spontaneous financing—trade credit (accounts payable).

For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a\nliability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.\nCost of Trade Credit\nTrade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,\nbank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade\ncredit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts\npayable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long\n576\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nas payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.\nHowever, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of\ncash discounts when offered by sellers.

To manage\ncash, the cash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected",

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments. Cash alternative investments are not committed to the\nstock market.\nSecurity\nDescription\nUS Treasury bills",

That is because purchases by Target’s customers who use\ntheir credit cards (e.g., VISA or MasterCard) create very short-term receivables—amounts that Target is waiting\nto collect but are very close to a cash sale. So instead of being reported as accounts receivable—a line item on\nthe Target balance sheet that is separate from cash and cash equivalents—these amounts receivable from\nthird-party financial institutions are considered part of the cash and cash equivalents and are a very liquid asst.\nFor example, the amount of $560,000,000 for January 30, 2021, is considered a cash equivalent since the\nsettlement of these accounts will happen in a day or two with cash deposited in Target’s bank accounts. When\na retailer sells product and accepts a credit card such as VISA, MasterCard, or American Express, the cash\ncollection happens very soon after the credit card sale—typically within 24 to 72 hours.3\nCompanies also invest excess funds in marketable securities.

The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due.

Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender).

Keep in mind that projected monthly sales amounts are\nnot equal to cash collected from sales. Because of sales on credit, some cash from sales lags credit sales as\ncollections can extend beyond the month of sale. Credit terms such terms such as net 30 (net amount owed to\nbe paid in 30 days) have to be considered when developing a forecasted cash collection pattern.\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n585\nFigure 19.7 Example of a Sales and Collections Budget\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file1) containing key Chapter 19\nExcel exhibits.",

If sales are expected to increase, purchases of\ninventory and some operating expenses would also increase. To meet the demand for goods and services (as\ndefined in the sales budget), a purchases (inventory) budget would be prepared. In this example (Figure 19.8),\nthe purchases budget shows projected purchases of inventory (merchandise) and the projected payments\n(also called disbursements) for each month.\nCash outflows as a result of purchases often do not equal the projected purchase amount. That is because\npayments for purchases are usually on credit (accounts payable), and so purchases for one month typically get\nspread out over a period of time that encompasses the current month and the month (or months) thereafter.\nTo keep this example simple, the assumption is that the purchases are paid for in the following month (an\naverage days payable outstanding of 30 days). However, in other cases, payment patterns may be based on\nother payment periods such as 45, 60, or even 90 days, depending on the trade credit terms.\nFigure 19.8 Purchases Budget\nAn operating expense budget is prepared next and is basically a prediction of the selling and administrative\nexpenditures of the company. Notice in Figure 19.9 that in the operating expense budget, cost of goods sold\n(an expense) is not included, nor are noncash expenses such as depreciation. The cash outlays related to\ngoods sold, at least in a merchandising operation, are accounted for in the purchases budget (payments for\npurchases of inventory.)\nWith the sales, purchases, and operating expense budgets prepared, the cash budget can be prepared. Some\nof the “inputs” to the cash budget are from the sales (collections of cash), purchases (payments), and the\noperating expense budget (cash expenditures for selling and administrative expenses). A sample cash budget\nand a discussion of its preparation follows in the next section of this chapter.\n586\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSample Cash Budget\nA cash budget is the last budget to be prepared and is often part of the financial budget (cash budget,",

            "chunk": "(Deficiency)\nA cash surplus means that cash can be invested in marketable securities. A cash deficiency\nmeans that some type of financing, such as a line of credit or bank loan, will be needed to\nprovide enough cash for operations and to maintain a minimum cash balance. This number is\nfound by subtracting the minimum cash balance from the preliminary ending cash balance.\nFor example, the cash surplus for January in Figure 19.10 is calculated with this formula:\n=B6-B7. Notice that all months in the Sample Cash Budget show a surplus except for August’s\nforecast of a deficit, which may require drawing on a line of credit to provide enough cash to\nmeet obligations in August.\nTable 19.5 Excel Formulas for Monthly Cash Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n589\nSummary\n19.1 What Is Working Capital?\nWorking capital is not only necessary to run a business; it is a resource that will expand and contract with\nbusiness cycles and must be carefully managed and monitored. The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables.

The credit managers’ mantra rings true: “The\nolder the receivable, the greater the likelihood that the account will not be collected.”\n19.5 Inventory Management\nInventory, usually the least liquid of the current assets, presents its own set of management challenges.\nFinding the optimal level of inventory is probably more of an art than a science. JIT helps to reduce the\ninvestment in inventory and lower the costs of storage, but stockout costs can be very damaging to\nprofitability.\n19.6 Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\nShort-term plans of a business are funded with cash, with cash budgets being a critical tool of planning. The\ncash budget takes into account a target amount of cash, factoring in all the motives for holding cash. A cash\nbudget looks ahead—predicting cash inflows and outflows, allocating for minimum cash balances to be\nmaintained, and helping management determine short-term financing needed. Although it is the last budget\nprepared, the preparation of the cash budget is an important financial planning exercise of companies small\nand large.\nKey Terms\naccounts receivable aging schedule\na report that shows amounts owed by customers by the age of the\naccount, as measured by the number of days since the sale\nallowance for doubtful accounts\nan account that contains the estimated amount of accounts receivable\nthat will not be collected\nbad debt expense\nan expense that a business incurs as a result of uncollectible accounts receivables\nbankruptcies\nfederal court procedures that protect distressed businesses from creditor collection efforts\nwhile allowing the debtor firm to liquidate its assets or devise a reorganization plan\n590\n19 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbenchmarking\nthe process of performance analysis that involves comparing financial condition and\noperating results against a standard, called a benchmark\nbill of lading\na document that is a detailed list of a goods that have been shipped; a receipt given by the\ncarrier (shipping company) to the seller as evidence that the goods have been shipped to the buyer\ncarrying costs\nall costs associated with having inventory in stock including storage costs, insurance,\ninventory obsolescence, and spoilage\ncash budget",

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of\noperating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStarbucks\nThe most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on\nthe company’s investor relations website under the Financial Data section (https://openstax.org/r/\nFinancial_Data_section).

                    "answer": "Starbucks has been able to expand its business model to include drive-through and drive-up locations. This expansion has allowed Starbucks to reach a larger customer base and increase its revenue. However, this expansion also comes with risks. For example, if there is a traffic jam or a long line of cars at the drive-through, customers may become frustrated and choose to go to a competitor instead. Additionally, if the weather is bad, customers may be less likely to use the drive-through and may choose to go to a competitor that offers indoor seating. Another risk associated with Starbucks’s business model is the risk of the coffee bean market. If the price of coffee beans increases, Starbucks will have to raise the price of its products to cover the cost, which may lead to a decrease in sales. Additionally, if there is a shortage of coffee beans, Starbucks may not be able to meet customer demand, which could lead to a loss of customers."

A change in the\nmarket price of these raw materials can significantly impact the profitability of a company.\nFor example, Starbucks must purchase coffee beans in order to make its coffee drinks. The price of coffee\nbeans is highly volatile. Sample prices of a pound of Arabica coffee beans over the past couple of decades are\nshown in Table 20.1. Over this period, the price of coffee beans ranged from a low of $0.52 per pound in the\nsummer of 2002 to a high of over $3.00 per pound in the spring of 2011. The costs, and thus the profits, of\nStarbucks will vary greatly depending on if the company is paying less than $1.00 per pound for coffee or if it is\npaying three times that much.\nDate\nPrice per Pound ($)\nJanuary 1, 2000\n1.09\nJanuary 1, 2004\n0.74\nJanuary 1, 2008\n1.39\nJanuary 1, 2012\n2.41\nJanuary 1, 2016\n1.46\nJanuary 1, 2020\n1.50\nTable 20.1 Price of Coffee in Select Years,\n2000-20205\nLong-Term Contracts\nOne method of hedging the risk of volatile input prices is for a firm to enter into long-term contracts with its\nsuppliers. Starbucks, for example, could enter into an agreement with a coffee farmer to purchase a particular\nquantity of coffee beans at a predetermined price over the next several years.\nThese long-term contracts can benefit both the buyer and the seller. The buyer is concerned that rising\ncommodity prices will increase its cost of goods sold. The seller, however, is concerned that falling commodity\nprices will mean lower revenue. By entering into a long-term contract, the buyer is able to lock in a price for its\nraw materials and the seller is able to lock in its sales price. Thus, both parties are able to reduce uncertainty.\nWhile long-term contracts reduce uncertainty about the commodity price, and thus reduce risk, there are\nseveral possible disadvantages to these types of contracts. First, both parties are exposed to the risk that the\nother party may default and fail to live up to the terms of the contract. Second, these contracts cannot be",

                    "question": "Describe commodity price risk.",
                    "answer": "Commodity price risk is the risk that the price of a commodity will change, resulting in a loss of profit for the company that uses the commodity. This risk is particularly important for companies that rely on raw materials or other commodities as inputs for their products or services. For example, a coffee company that uses coffee beans as an input may be exposed to commodity price risk if the price of coffee beans fluctuates. If the price of coffee beans increases, the company may have to pay more for its inputs, which could reduce its profits. On the other hand, if the price of coffee beans decreases, the company may be able to purchase its inputs at a lower cost, which could increase its profits. To manage this risk, companies may use hedging strategies such as long-term contracts, vertical integration, or futures contracts."

                    "question": "Explain the use of long-term contracts as a hedge.",
                    "answer": "A long-term contract is a contract between a buyer and a seller that specifies the terms of a transaction over a long period of time, typically several years. The use of long-term contracts as a hedge can help companies manage commodity price risk by locking in the price of a commodity for a long period of time. For example, a company that uses coffee beans as an input may enter into a long-term contract with a coffee farmer to purchase a certain quantity of coffee beans at a fixed price over the next several years. This can help the company manage the risk of fluctuating coffee bean prices, as it will be able to purchase its inputs at a fixed price regardless of market conditions. However, there are some risks associated with long-term contracts, such as the risk of default by the other party, so companies should carefully consider the terms of any long-term contract before entering into it."

                    "answer": "Vertical integration is a business strategy in which a company expands its operations to include both upstream and downstream activities. Upstream activities involve the production of raw materials or components, while downstream activities involve the sale and distribution of finished products. By integrating these activities, a company can reduce its exposure to commodity price risk, as it will be able to control both the supply and demand for its inputs and outputs. For example, a coffee company that is vertically integrated may own its own coffee farms, which allows it to control the supply of coffee beans and reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of coffee beans. However, vertical integration can also be costly and may require significant investment in new facilities and equipment, so companies should carefully consider the benefits and risks of this strategy before implementing it."

                    "answer": "A futures contract is a standardized contract between a buyer and a seller that specifies the terms of a transaction for a specific commodity or financial instrument at a future date. The use of futures contracts as a hedge can help companies manage commodity price risk by allowing them to lock in the price of a commodity for a future date. For example, a coffee company may enter into a futures contract to purchase coffee beans at a fixed price for delivery in six months. This can help the company manage the risk of fluctuating coffee bean prices, as it will be able to purchase its inputs at a fixed price regardless of market conditions. However, there are some risks associated with futures contracts, such as the risk of default by the other party or the risk of changes in market conditions that could affect the price of the commodity, so companies should carefully consider the terms of any futures contract before entering into it."

The company can get out of the contract at any time by selling it to a third party at the\ncurrent market price.\nA futures contract does not have the credit risk that a long-term contract has. Futures exchanges require\ntraders to post margin when buying or selling commodities futures contracts. The margin, or collateral, serves\nas a guarantee that traders will honor their obligations. Additionally, through a procedure known as marking\nto market, cash flows are exchanged daily rather than only at the end of the contract. Because gains and\nlosses are computed each day based on the change in the price of the futures contract, there is not the same\nrisk as with a long-term contract that the counterparty to the contract will not be able to fulfill their obligation.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe CME Group\nIn 2007, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange merged with the Chicago Board of Trade to form CME Group Inc.\nCME Group provides trading in futures as well as other types of contracts that companies can use to hedge\nrisk.\nYou can watch the video Getting Started with Your Broker (https://openstax.org/r/\nGetting_Started_with_Your_Broker) to learn how futures contracts for agricultural products such as coffee\nbeans, corn, wheat, and soybeans are traded.

Transaction risk is the risk that the value of a business's expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange rates. Translation risk is the risk that a business's financial statements will be impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. Economic risk is the risk that a business's operations will be impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. For example, a business that exports goods may face economic risk if the currency of the country it is exporting to appreciates relative to the currency of the country it is exporting from. This can make the business's goods more expensive in the foreign country, reducing demand for the goods and potentially reducing the business's revenue."

Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the\nexpenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.\nThe Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in\nFigure 20.3. In 2012, $1.00 could be purchased with fewer than 80 Japanese yen. In 2015, it took over 120 yen to\npurchase $1.00.\nFigure 20.3 Japanese Yen to One US Dollar8\nIf a company is receiving yen from customers and paying expenses in dollars, the company is harmed when\nthe yen depreciates relative to the dollar, meaning that the yen the company receives from its customers can\nbe exchanged for fewer dollars. Conversely, when the yen appreciates, it takes fewer yen to purchase each\ndollar; this appreciation of the yen benefits companies with revenues in yen and expenses in dollars.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nProjecting Sales in US Dollars\nThe managers of a firm think that the exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollars will be\nnext year.

Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of\nthis introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that\n•\nthe higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate\n9\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n615\nchanges;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.\nSwap-Based Hedging\nAs the name suggests, a swap involves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something.

Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate.

Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates.

Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s.

Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha.

If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt.

The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has\nor its sales\nEuropean option\nan option that the holder can exercise only on the expiration date\nexchange rate\nthe price of one currency in terms of another currency\nexercise price (strike price)\nthe price the option holder pays for the underlying asset when exercising an\noption",

The curve is usually plotted on a graph with the x-axis representing the time to maturity and the y-axis representing the interest rate. The shape of the curve can vary depending on economic conditions and the supply and demand for debt securities. A steep yield curve indicates that investors are willing to accept higher interest rates for longer-term bonds, while a flat yield curve indicates that investors are willing to accept lower interest rates for both short-term and long-term bonds. A yield curve can also be used to predict future interest rates and economic growth."

                    "answer": "A bond is a type of debt security, while a stock is a type of equity security. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer, who is typically a corporation or government entity, and in return, you receive regular interest payments and the principal amount of the loan at maturity. On the other hand, when you buy a stock, you are purchasing a share of ownership in a corporation, and you receive a portion of the company's profits in the form of dividends. The value of a bond is based on the issuer's creditworthiness and the interest rate, while the value of a stock is based on the company's financial performance and the overall market conditions. Both bonds and stocks can be traded on the secondary market, but they have different risks and rewards, and they are subject to different regulations."
