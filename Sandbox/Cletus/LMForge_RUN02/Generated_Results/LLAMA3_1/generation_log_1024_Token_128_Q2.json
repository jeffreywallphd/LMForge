            "chunk": "Statutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes, \nzoning laws, and misdemeanors or infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking. Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French \ncourts may feel bound to reach the same result in future cases, under the doctrine of jurisprudence \nconstante. The major agency for growth and change, however, is the legislature, not the courts.” \n \nCivil-law systems are used throughout Europe as well as in Central and South America. Some nations in \nAsia and Africa have also adopted codes based on European civil law. Germany, Holland, Spain, France, \nand Portugal all had colonies outside of Europe, and many of these colonies adopted the legal practices \nthat were imposed on them by colonial rule, much like the original thirteen states of the United States, \nwhich adopted English common-law practices. \n \nOne source of possible confusion at this point is that we have already referred to US civil law in contrast to \ncriminal law. But the European civil law covers both civil and criminal law. \nThere are also legal systems that differ significantly from the common-law and civil-law systems.

Islamic and other \nreligion-based systems of law bring different values and assumptions to social and commercial relations. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLegal systems vary widely in their aims and in the way they process civil and criminal cases. Common-law \nsystems use juries, have one judge, and adhere to precedent. Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct \nthan achieving the right results. A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society,",

Thus a contract dispute resolved by an Arkansas court cannot be relitigated in North \nDakota when the plaintiff wants to collect on the Arkansas judgment in North Dakota. Fourth, state \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n83 \ncourts often must consider the laws of other states in deciding cases involving issues where two \nstates have an interest, such as when drivers from two different states collide in a third state. Under \nthese circumstances, state judges will consult their own state’s case decisions involving conflicts of \nlaws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state’s laws to decide the case (see Table 3.1 \n\"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). \n \nAs state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal courts are often concerned with state law \nand with what happens in state courts. Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts. The Constitution \nestablished diversity jurisdiction because it was feared that local courts would be hostile toward \npeople from other states and that they would need separate courts. In 2009, nearly a third of all \nlawsuits filed in federal court were based on diversity of citizenship. In these cases, the federal courts \nwere applying state law, rather than taking federal question jurisdiction, where federal law \nprovided the basis for the lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or defendant). \n \nWhy are there so many diversity cases in federal courts? Defense lawyers believe that there is \nsometimes a “home-court advantage” for an in-state plaintiff who brings a lawsuit against a \nnonresident in his local state court. The defense attorney is entitled to ask for removal to a federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n84 \ncourt where there is diversity. This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial function \nhas original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to \nthem. A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in",

Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85 \nOne familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases \ninvolving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for \nconsiderably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000). The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final.

Each circuit oversees the work of the district courts in \nseveral states. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district \ncourts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears \nappeals from district courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, \nHawaii, and Guam. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals from the \ndistrict court in Washington, DC, as well as from numerous federal administrative agencies (see Chapter 5 \n\"Administrative Law\"). The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington, hears \nappeals in patent and customs cases. Appeals are usually heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes \nthere will be a rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges sit to hear the case “en \nbanc.” \n \nThere are also several specialized courts in the federal judicial system. These include the US Tax Court, \nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims. \n \nUnited States Supreme Court \nOverseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC. It consists of nine justices—the \nchief justice and eight associate justices. (This number is not constitutionally required; Congress can \nestablish any number. It has been set at nine since after the Civil War.) The Supreme Court has selective \ncontrol over most of its docket. By law, the cases it hears represent only a tiny fraction of the cases that are \nsubmitted. In 2008, the Supreme Court had numerous petitions (over 7,000, not including thousands of \npetitions from prisoners) but heard arguments in only 87 cases. The Supreme Court does not sit in panels. \nAll the justices hear and consider each case together, unless a justice has a conflict of interest and must \nwithdraw from hearing the case. \n \nFigure 3.1 The Federal Judicial Circuits \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n88 \n \nFederal judges—including Supreme Court justices—are nominated by the president and must be \nconfirmed by the Senate. Unlike state judges, who are usually elected and preside for a fixed term of years, \nfederal judges sit for life unless they voluntarily retire or are impeached. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nTrial courts and appellate courts have different functions. State trial courts sometimes hear cases with federal \nlaw issues, and federal courts sometimes hear cases with state law issues. Within both state and federal court \nsystems, it is useful to know the different kinds of courts and what cases they can decide. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why all of this complexity? Why don’t state courts hear only claims based on state law, and federal courts \nonly federal-law-based claims? \n2. Why would a plaintiff in Iowa with a case against a New Jersey defendant prefer to have the case heard in \nIowa? \n3. James, a New Jersey resident, is sued by Jonah, an Iowa resident. After a trial in which James appears and \nvigorously defends himself, the Iowa state court awards Jonah $136,750 dollars in damages for his tort \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n89 \nclaim. In trying to collect from James in New Jersey, Jonah must have the New Jersey court certify the Iowa \njudgment. Why, ordinarily, must the New Jersey court do so? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.2 The Problem of Jurisdiction \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue? Time—and \nthe Supreme Court—will tell. \n \nClass Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n122 \nMost lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other \norganization. But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave. If she does, she will not be \nincluded in an eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n123 \ncannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the \noutcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAnyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has \nstanding will be heard by the courts. Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to \nensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries. Class actions are \na way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Fuchs Funeral Home is carrying the body of Charles Emmenthaler to its resting place at Forest Lawn \nCemetery. Charles’s wife, Chloe, and their two children, Chucky and Clarice, are following the hearse \nwhen the coffin falls on the street, opens, and the body of Charles Emmenthaler falls out. The wife and \nchildren are shocked and aggrieved and later sue in civil court for damages.

Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was \nchallenged on the ground that Congress lacked the power under the commerce clause to regulate what \nwas otherwise fairly local conduct. For example, Title II of the act prohibited racial discrimination in \npublic accommodations (such as hotels, motels, and restaurants), leading to the famous case \nof Katzenbach v. McClung(1964). \n \nOllie McClung’s barbeque place in Birmingham, Alabama, allowed “colored” people to buy takeout at the \nback of the restaurant but not to sit down with “white” folks inside. The US attorney sought a court order \nto require Ollie to serve all races and colors, but Ollie resisted on commerce clause grounds: the federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n150 \ngovernment had no business regulating a purely local establishment. Indeed, Ollie did not advertise \nnationally, or even regionally, and had customers only from the local area. But the court found that some \n42 percent of the supplies for Ollie’s restaurant had moved in the channels of interstate commerce. This \nwas enough to sustain federal regulation based on the commerce clause. [3] \n \nFor nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that Congress could almost always find some \ninterstate commerce connection for any law it might pass. It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 \nwhen the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that \nprohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The law was part of a twenty-year trend \n(roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime. Lopez’s \nlawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged \nthe law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this \nlegislation. The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the \nSupreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because \neducation of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near \nschool yards detracted from students’ education. The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the \ngovernment’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything. \nLopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court. \n \nCongress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided. But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair \ninterstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy \nBrzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players \nat Virginia Tech, had raped her. In 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against Morrison and Crawford \nunder Virginia Tech’s sexual assault policy. After a hearing, Morrison was found guilty of sexual assault \nand sentenced to immediate suspension for two semesters. Crawford was not punished. A second hearing \nagain found Morrison guilty. After an appeal through the university’s administrative system, Morrison’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n151 \npunishment was set aside, as it was found to be “excessive.” Ultimately, Brzonkala dropped out of the \nuniversity. Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging \nthat Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides \na federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional. In \ndismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section \n13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly \nidentified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA. Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed, as \ndid the Supreme Court.",

Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything \nthat moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of \nsomething instead of buying something. \n \nThus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing \nthat differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that \noriginate elsewhere. If Michigan were to let counties decide for themselves whether to take garbage from \noutside of the county or not, this could also be a discrimination based on a place of origin outside the \nstate. (Suppose, for instance, each county were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then \nall Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste from outside of Michigan, which is \ndiscriminatory.) [3] \n \nThe Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste requirements that did not differentiate on the \nbasis of origin. If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific hazards, then the law would apply \nequally to in-state and out-of-state garbage. Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could \nstill act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state \nwaste from coming into their own borders. But Congress has declined to do so. What follows is a \nstatement from one of the US senators from Michigan, Carl Levin, in 2003, regarding the significant \namounts of waste that were coming into Michigan from Toronto, Canada. \n \nDealing with Unwelcome Waste \nSenator Carl Levin, January 2003 \nMichigan is facing an intolerable situation with regard to the importation of waste from other \nstates and Canada. \n \nCanada is the largest source of waste imports to Michigan. Approximately 65 truckloads of waste \ncome in to Michigan per day from Toronto alone, and an estimated 110–130 trucks come in from \nCanada each day. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n156 \nThis problem isn’t going to get any better. Ontario’s waste shipments are growing as the Toronto \narea signs new contracts for waste disposal here and closes its two remaining landfills. At the \nbeginning of 1999, the Toronto area was generating about 2.8 million tons of waste annually, \nabout 700,000 tons of which were shipped to Michigan. By early this year, barring unforeseen \ndevelopments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal. \nWhy can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada? They say that after 20 years of searching they \nhave not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage. Ontario has about \n345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles. With six times the land mass, \nthat argument is laughable. \n \nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, for every five years of \ndisposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill \ncapacity. The environmental impacts on landfills, including groundwater contamination, noise \npollution and foul odors, are exacerbated by the significant increase in the use of our landfills \nfrom sources outside of Michigan. \n \nI have teamed up with Senator Stabenow and Congressman Dingell to introduce legislation that \nwould strengthen our ability to stop shipments of waste from Canada. \n \nWe have protections contained in a 17 year-old international agreement between the U.S. and \nCanada called the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste. \nThe U.S. and Canada entered into this agreement in 1986 to allow the shipment of hazardous \nwaste across the U.S./Canadian border for treatment, storage or disposal. In 1992, the two \ncountries decided to add municipal solid waste to the agreement. To protect both countries, the \nagreement requires notification of shipments to the importing country and it also provides that \nthe importing country may withdraw consent for shipments. Both reasons are evidence that these \nshipments were intended to be limited. However, the agreement’s provisions have not been \nenforced by the United States. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n157 \nCanada could not export waste to Michigan without the 1986 agreement, but the U.S. has not \nimplemented the provisions that are designed to protect the people of Michigan. Although those of \nus that introduced this legislation believe that the Environmental Protection Agency has the \nauthority to enforce this agreement, they have not done so. Our bill would require the EPA \n[Environmental Protection Agency] to enforce the agreement. \n \nIn order to protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Michigan and our environment, we \nmust consider the impact of the importation of trash on state and local recycling efforts, landfill",

Monopolies, for example, happen in \nthe natural course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1. There are many buyers and many sellers, and none of them has a substantial share of the market. \n2. All buyers and sellers in the market are free to enter the market or leave it. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n207 \n3. All buyers and all sellers have full and perfect knowledge of what other buyers and sellers are up to, \nincluding knowledge of prices, quantity, and quality of all goods being bought or sold. \n4. The goods being sold in the market are similar enough to each other that participants do not have \nstrong preferences as to which seller or buyer they deal with. \n5. The costs and benefits of making or using the goods that are exchanged in the market are borne only by \nthose who buy or sell those goods and not by third parties or people “external” to the market \ntransaction. (That is, there are no “externalities.”) \n6. All buyers and sellers are utility maximizers; each participant in the market tries to get as much as \npossible for as little as possible. \n7. There are no parties, institutions, or governmental units regulating the price, quantity, or quality of any \nof the goods being bought and sold in the market. \n \n \nIn short, some forms of legislation and regulation are needed to counter a tendency toward consolidation \nof economic power and discriminatory attitudes toward certain individuals and groups and to insist that \npeople and companies clean up their own messes and not hide information that would empower voluntary \nchoices in the free market. \n \nBut there are additional reasons to regulate. For example, in economic systems, it is likely for natural \nmonopolies to occur. These are where one firm can most efficiently supply all of the good or service. \nHaving duplicate (or triplicate) systems for supplying electricity, for example, would be inefficient, so \nmost states have a public utilities commission to determine both price and quality of service. This is direct \nregulation. \n \nSometimes destructive competition can result if there is no regulation. Banking and insurance are good \nexamples of this. Without government regulation of banks (setting standards and methods), open and \nfierce competition would result in widespread bank failures. That would erode public confidence in banks \nand business generally. The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, \nhowever, an example of destructive noncompetition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n208 \n \nOther market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation. For example, there is a need to regulate \nfrequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, \nnational defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something \nthat must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods",

The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

See Section 5.6 \n\"Cases\", American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan. \n \nIn summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) \nchallenge agency action where such action is the following: \n \n• \nnot in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority \n• \nnot in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act \n• \nnot in accordance with the substantial evidence test \n• \nunwarranted by the facts \n• \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord with the law \nSection 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets out those standards. While it is difficult to show that \nan agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so held. For example, after the \nReagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies \nchallenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that \nthe agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record \nand the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies \nthus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased \npassenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured. [1] \n \nSuing the Government \nIn the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative \nagencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly \nlegitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their \nbounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have? \n \nMainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private \nindividuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n226 \nsovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route. [2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year.",

In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set \nin the United States through the Constitution’s prohibition on “cruel or unusual punishments.” \n \nIt is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. But there are far too many criminal laws for \nanyone to know them all. Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of \n“criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving \nwithout a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society. You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws. Teenagers hanging around \nthe sidewalks on Main Street were sometimes arrested for “loitering.” The constitutional void-for-\nvagueness doctrine has led the courts to overturn statutes that are not clear. For example, “vagrancy” \nwas long held to be a crime, but US courts began some forty years ago to overturn vagrancy and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n243 \n“suspicious person” statutes on the grounds that they are too vague for people to know what they are \nbeing asked not to do. \nThis requirement that criminal statutes not be vague does not mean that the law always defines \ncrimes in ways that can be easily and clearly understood. Many statutes use terminology developed \nby the common-law courts. For example, a California statute defines murder as “the unlawful killing \nof a human being, with malice aforethought.” If no history backed up these words, they would be \nunconstitutionally vague. But there is a rich history of judicial decisions that provides meaning for \nmuch of the arcane language like “malice aforethought” strewn about in the statute books. \n \nBecause a crime is an act that the legislature has defined as socially harmful, the parties involved \ncannot agree among themselves to forget a particular incident, such as a barroom brawl, if the \nauthorities decide to prosecute. This is one of the critical distinctions between criminal and civil law. \nAn assault is both a crime and a tort. The person who was assaulted may choose to forgive his \nassailant and not to sue him for damages. But he cannot stop the prosecutor from bringing an \nindictment against the assailant. (However, because of crowded dockets, a victim that declines to \npress charges may cause a busy prosecutor to choose to not to bring an indictment.) \n \nA crime consists of an act defined as criminal—an actus reus—and the requisite “criminal intent.” \nSomeone who has a burning desire to kill a rival in business or romance and who may actually intend \nto murder but does not act on his desire has not committed a crime. He may have a “guilty mind”—\nthe translation of the Latin phrase mens rea—but he is guilty of no crime. A person who is forced to \ncommit a crime at gunpoint is not guilty of a crime, because although there was an act defined as \ncriminal—an actus reus—there was no criminal intent. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCrimes are usually defined by statute and constitute an offense against society. In each case, there must be \nboth an act and some mens rea (criminal intent). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n244 \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense. If Barney (who has poor sight), shoots at a tree stump, thinking it is his \nneighbor, Ralph, intending to kill him, has he committed an attempt? Many courts would hold that he has \nnot. But the distinction between factual impossibility and legal impossibility is not always clear, and the \ntrend seems to be to punish the intended attempt. \n \nConspiracy \nUnder both federal and state laws, it is a separate offense to work with others toward the commission of a \ncrime. When two or more people combine to carry out an unlawful purpose, they are engaged in a \nconspiracy. The law of conspiracy is quite broad, especially when it is used by prosecutors in connection \nwith white-collar crimes. Many people can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is unnecessary \nto show that the actions they took were sufficient to constitute either the crime or an attempt. Usually, the \nprosecution needs to show only (1) an agreement and (2) a single overt act in furtherance of the \nconspiracy. Thus if three people agree to rob a bank, and if one of them goes to a store to purchase a gun \nto be used in the holdup, the three can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery. Even the purchase \nof an automobile to be used as the getaway car could support a conspiracy conviction. \n \nThe act of any one of the conspirators is imputed to the other members of the conspiracy. It does not \nmatter, for instance, that only one of the bank robbers fired the gun that killed a guard. All can be \nconvicted of murder. That is so even if one of the conspirators was stationed as a lookout several blocks \naway and even if he specifically told the others that his agreement to cooperate would end “just as soon as \nthere is shooting.” \n \nAgency and Corporations \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n257 \nA person can be guilty of a crime if he acts through another. Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the \nguilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But imputation of guilt is not \nlimited to a conspiracy. The agent may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate officer \ndirects a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home. The employee \nreasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains \nmoney that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit. The law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in recent years. The tendency is to hold \nthe corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group \nwithin the corporation (the president or board of directors). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAlthough proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by \ninference (circumstantially). Conspirators may not actually commit a crime, for example, but in preparing for a \ncriminal act, they may be guilty of the crime of conspiracy. Certain corporate officers, as well, may not be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n258 \ndirectly committing criminal acts but may be held criminally responsible for acts of their agents and \ncontractors. \n \n \nEXERCISES",

Describe the most significant constitutional rights of defendants in US courts, and name the source of \nthese rights. \n2. Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence. \n \n \nSearch and Seizure \nThe rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that \nmake up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it. But it remains \ngenerally true that the prosecutor may not use evidence willfully taken by the police in violation of \nconstitutional rights generally, and most often in the violation of Fourth Amendment rights. (The fruits of \na coerced confession are also excluded.) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n266 \n \nDouble Jeopardy \nThe Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from prosecuting a person twice for the same offense. \nThe amendment says that no person shall be “subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of \nlife or limb.” If a defendant is acquitted, the government may not appeal. If a defendant is convicted and \nhis conviction is upheld on appeal, he may not thereafter be reprosecuted for the same crime. \n \nSelf-Incrimination \nThe Fifth Amendment is also the source of a person’s right against self-incrimination (no person “shall be \ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself”). The debate over the limits of this right \nhas given rise to an immense literature. In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means \nthat the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the \njury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded \nfrom evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession). \nIn Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that no confession is admissible if the police have not \nfirst advised a suspect of his constitutional rights, including the right to have a lawyer present to advise \nhim during the questioning. [1] These so-called Miranda warnings have prompted scores of follow-up cases \nthat have made this branch of jurisprudence especially complex. \n \n \nSpeedy Trial \nThe Sixth Amendment tells the government that it must try defendants speedily. How long a delay is too \nlong depends on the circumstances in each case. In 1975, Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give \npriority to criminal cases in federal courts. It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within \nseventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible reasons for delay). \n \nCross-Examination \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n267 \nThe Sixth Amendment also says that the defendant shall have the right to confront witnesses against him.",

The family reasoned that after the \nexpiration of the employment contract, Sharp was employed only in a managerial capacity, not as an \ninventor. The court disagreed and invoked the shop rights doctrine, under which an invention \n“developed and perfected in [a company’s] plant with its time, materials, and appliances, and wholly at its \nexpense” may be used by the company without payment of royalties: “Because the servant uses his \nmaster’s time, facilities and materials to attain a concrete result, the employer is entitled to use that which \nembodies his own property and to duplicate it as often as he may find occasion to employ similar \nappliances in his business.” The company would have been given complete ownership of the patents had \nthere been an express or implied (e.g., the employee is hired to make inventions) contract to this effect \nbetween Sharp and the company. \n \nPrincipal’s Duty to Agent \nIn this category, we may note that the principal owes the agent duties in contract, tort, and—statutorily—\nworkers’ compensation law. \n \nContract Duties \nThe fiduciary relationship of agent to principal does not run in reverse—that is, the principal is not the \nagent’s fiduciary. Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his \nagent. \n \nGeneral Contract Duties \nThese duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal \nhas a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” [5] The principal is allowed, \nhowever, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty \nto inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of \nassigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may \nbe dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject \nthe principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n387 \nprincipal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends \non a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, \nand the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, \nand so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it. \n \nEmployment at Will \nUnder the traditional “employment-at-will” doctrine, an employee who is not hired for a specific period \ncan be fired at any time, for any reason (except bad reasons: an employee cannot be fired, for example, for \nreporting that his employer’s paper mill is illegally polluting groundwater). This doctrine has been much \ncriticized. \n \nDuty to Indemnify \nAgents commonly spend money pursuing the principal’s business. Unless the agreement explicitly \nprovides otherwise, the principal has a duty to indemnify or reimburse the agent. A familiar form of \nindemnity is the employee expense account. \n \nTort and Workers’ Compensation Duties \nThe employer owes the employee—any employee, not just agents—certain statutorily imposed tort and \nworkers’ compensation duties. \n \nBackground to Workers’ Compensation \nAndy, who works in a dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong shed. Andy warns his \nfellow employee Bill that he has done so. Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands on \nthe ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At \ncommon law, the answer would be no—three times no. First, the “fellow-servant” rule would bar recovery \nbecause the employer was held not to be responsible for torts committed by one employee against \nanother. Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the dynamite had been negligently stored by the \nemployer rather than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been dismissed. Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer. It may not now take advantage of that failure to defeat the plaintiffs’ rights to ESPP \nbenefits. Thus, we reject Microsoft’s final argument. \n \nConclusion \nFor the reasons stated, the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Microsoft and denial of \nsummary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for the \ndetermination of any questions of individual eligibility for benefits that may remain following issuance of \nthis opinion and for calculation of the damages or benefits due the various class members. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. In a 1993 Wall Street Journal article, James Bovard asserted that the IRS “is carrying out a sweeping \ncampaign to slash the number of Americans permitted to be self-employed—and to punish the companies \nthat contract with them…IRS officials indicate that more than half the nation’s self-employed should no \nlonger be able to work for themselves.” Why did Microsoft want these employees to “be able to work for \nthemselves”? \n2. Why did the employees accept employment as independent contractors? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n404 \n3. It seems unlikely that the purpose of the IRS’s campaign was really to keep people from working for \nthemselves, despite Mr. Bovard’s assumption. What was the purpose of the campaign? \n4. Why did the IRS and the court determine that these “independent contractors” were in fact employees? \n \n \nBreach of Fiduciary Duty \nBacon v. Volvo Service Center, Inc. \n597 S.E.2d 440 (Ga. App. 2004) \n \nSmith, J. \n \n[This appeal is] taken in an action that arose when two former employees left an existing business and \nbegan a new, competing business.…Bacon and Johnson, two former employees of Volvo Service Center, \nInc. (VSC), and the new company they formed, South Gwinnett Volvo Service, Ltd. (SGVS), appeal from \nthe trial court’s denial of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the jury’s verdict in favor of VSC.… \nVSC filed suit against appellants, alleging a number of claims arising from the use by Bacon, who had \nbeen a service technician at VSC, of VSC’s customer list, and his soliciting Johnson, a service writer, and \nanother VSC employee to join SGVS. SGVS moved for a directed verdict on certain claims at the close of \nplaintiff’s evidence and at the close of the case, which motions were denied. The jury was asked to respond \nto specific interrogatories, and it found for VSC and against all three appellants on VSC’s claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets. The jury also found for plaintiff against Bacon for breach of fiduciary \nduty,…tortious interference with business relations, employee piracy, and conversion of corporate assets. \nThe jury awarded VSC attorney fees, costs, and exemplary damages stemming from the claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets. Judgment was entered on the jury’s verdict, and appellants’ motion for \nj.n.o.v. was denied. This appeal ensued. We find that VSC did not meet its burden of proof as to the claims \nfor misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty, or employee piracy, and the trial court \nshould have granted appellants’ motion for j.n.o.v. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n405 \nConstrued to support the jury’s verdict, the evidence of record shows that Bacon was a technician at VSC \nwhen he decided to leave and open a competing business. Before doing so, he printed a list of VSC’s \ncustomers from one of VSC’s two computers. Computer access was not password restricted, was easy to \nuse, and was used by many employees from time to time. \n \nAbout a year after he left VSC, Bacon gave Johnson and another VSC employee an offer of employment at \nhis new Volvo repair shop, which was about to open. Bacon and Johnson advertised extensively, and the \ncustomer list was used to send flyers to some VSC customers who lived close to the new shop’s location. \nThese activities became the basis for VSC’s action against Bacon, Johnson, and their new shop, SGVS.… \n \n1. The Georgia Trade Secrets Act of 1990, [Citation], defines a “trade secret” as \ninformation, without regard to form, including, but not limited to,…a list of actual or potential \ncustomers or suppliers which is not commonly known by or available to the public and which \ninformation: \n(A) Derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not \nbeing readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value \nfrom its disclosure or use; and \n(B) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. \n \nIf an employer does not prove both prongs of this test, it is not entitled to protection under the Act. Our \nSupreme Court held in [Citation, 1991] for instance, that information was not a trade secret within the",

Sibley, Lindsay & Curr Co. \n330 N.E.2d 603 (N.Y. 1975) \n \nWachtler, J. \n \nThis appeal involves a claim for workmen’s compensation benefits for the period during which the \nclaimant was incapacitated by severe depression caused by the discovery of her immediate supervisor’s \nbody after he had committed suicide. \n \nThe facts as adduced at a hearing before the Workmen’s Compensation Board are uncontroverted. The \nclaimant, Mrs. Diana Wolfe, began her employment with the respondent department store, Sibley, \nLindsay & Curr Co. in February, 1968. After working for some time as an investigator in the security \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n408 \ndepartment of the store she became secretary to Mr. John Gorman, the security director. It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays. Mrs. Wolfe testified that throughout the several years she worked at Sibley’s Mr. \nGorman reacted to this holiday pressure by becoming extremely agitated and nervous. She noted, \nhowever, that this anxiety usually disappeared when the holiday season was over. Unfortunately, Mr. \nGorman’s nervous condition failed to abate after the 1970 holidays.… \nDespite the fact that he followed Mrs. Wolfe’s advice to see a doctor, Mr. Gorman’s mental condition \ncontinued to deteriorate. On one occasion he left work at her suggestion because he appeared to be so \nnervous. This condition persisted until the morning of June 9, 1971 when according to the claimant, Mr. \nGorman looked much better and even smiled and ‘tousled her hair’ when she so remarked. \n \nA short time later Mr. Gorman called her on the intercom and asked her to call the police to room 615. \nMrs. Wolfe complied with this request and then tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Gorman on the \nintercom. She entered his office to find him lying in a pool of blood caused by a self-inflicted gunshot \nwound in the head. Mrs. Wolfe became extremely upset and was unable to continue working that day. \n \nShe returned to work for one week only to lock herself in her office to avoid the questions of her fellow \nworkers. Her private physician perceiving that she was beset by feelings of guilt referred her to a \npsychiatrist and recommended that she leave work, which she did. While at home she ruminated about \nher guilt in failing to prevent the suicide and remained in bed for long periods of time staring at the \nceiling. The result was that she became unresponsive to her husband and suffered a weight loss of 20 \npounds. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Grinols diagnosed her condition as an acute depressive reaction. \n \nAfter attempting to treat her in his office Dr. Grinols realized that the severity of her depression mandated \nhospitalization. Accordingly, the claimant was admitted to the hospital on July 9, 1971 where she \nremained for two months during which time she received psychotherapy and medication. After she was \ndischarged, Dr. Grinols concluded that there had been no substantial remission in her depression and \nruminative guilt and so had her readmitted for electroshock treatment. These treatments lasted for three \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n409 \nweeks and were instrumental in her recovery. She was again discharged and, in mid-January, 1972, \nresumed her employment with Sibley, Lindsay & Curr. \nMrs. Wolfe’s claim for workmen’s compensation was granted by the referee and affirmed by the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Board. On appeal the Appellate Division reversed citing its opinions in \n[Citations], [concluding]…that mental injury precipitated solely by psychic trauma is not compensable as \na matter of law. We do not agree with this conclusion. \n \nWorkmen’s compensation, as distinguished from tort liability which is essentially based on fault, is \ndesigned to shift the risk of loss of earning capacity caused by industrial accidents from the worker to \nindustry and ultimately the consumer. In light of its beneficial and remedial character the Workmen’s \nCompensation Law should be construed liberally in favor of the employee [Citation]. \n \nLiability under the act is predicated on accidental injury arising out of and in the course of \nemployment.…Applying these concepts to the case at bar we note that there is no issue raised concerning \nthe causal relationship between the occurrence and the injury. The only testimony on this matter was \ngiven by Dr. Grinols who stated unequivocally that the discovery of her superior’s body was the competent \nproducing cause of her condition. Nor is there any question as to the absence of physical impact. \nAccordingly, the focus of our inquiry is whether or not there has been an accidental injury within the",

The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply. If a hungry deliveryman stops at a restaurant outside the normal \nlunch hour, intending to continue to his next delivery after eating, he is within the scope of employment. \nBut suppose he decides to take the truck home that evening, in violation of rules, in order to get an early \nstart the next morning. Suppose he decides to stop by the beach, which is far away from his route. Does it \nmake a difference if the employer knows that his deliverymen do this? \n \nThe Zone of Risk Test \nCourt decisions in the last forty years have moved toward a different standard, one that looks to the \nforeseeability of the agent’s conduct. By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for \nvicarious liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be, doing—more or less—what she is \nsupposed to be doing, and the incident arose from the employee’s pursuit of the employer’s interest \n(again, more or less). That is, the employer is within the zone of risk if the servant is in the place within \nwhich, if the master were to send out a search party to find a missing employee, it would be reasonable to \nlook. See Section 4, Cockrell v. Pearl River Valley Water Supply Dist. \n \nSpecial Cases of Vicarious Liability \nVicarious liability is not limited to harm caused in the course of an agency relationship. It may also be \nimposed in other areas, including torts of family members, and other torts governed by statute or \nregulation. We will examine each in turn. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n428 \n \nUse of Automobiles \nA problem commonly arises when an automobile owner lends his vehicle to a personal friend, someone \nwho is not an agent, and the borrower injures a third person. Is the owner liable? In many states, the \nowner is not liable; in other states, however, two approaches impose liability on the owner. \nThe first approach is legislative: owner’s consent statutes make the owner liable when the automobile \nis being driven with his consent or knowledge. The second approach to placing liability on the owner is \njudicial and known as the family purpose doctrine. Under this doctrine, a family member who \nnegligently injures someone with the car subjects the owner to liability if the family member was \nfurthering family purposes. These are loosely defined to include virtually every use to which a child, for \nexample, might put a car. In a Georgia case, Dixon v. Phillips, the father allowed his minor son to drive \nthe car but expressly forbade him from letting anyone else do so. [2] Nevertheless, the son gave the wheel \nto a friend and a collision occurred while both were in the car. The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction \n(to which Mr. Dickens’s Mr. Bumble responded, in the memorable line, “If the law supposes that, the law \nis a ass—a idiot” [4]). This ancient view has been abrogated by statute or by court ruling in all the states, so \nthat now a wife is solely responsible for her own torts unless she in fact serves as her husband’s agent. \n \nUnlike wives, children are not presumed at common law to be agents or extensions of the father so that \nnormally parents are not vicariously liable for their children’s torts. However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers. Thus the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n429 \nIllinois Parental Responsibility Law provides the following: “The parent or legal guardian of an \nunemancipated minor who resides with such parent or legal guardian is liable for actual damages for the",

The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal. Who may enforce the contracts against them? \n \nThe developer and the agents may sue to compel transfer of title. The undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal may act to enforce his rights unless the contract specifically prohibits it or there is a \nrepresentation that the signatories are not signing for an undisclosed principal. The agents may also bring \nsuit to enforce the principal’s contract rights because, as agents for an undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal, they are considered parties to their contracts. \n \nNow suppose the developer attempts to call off the deal. Whom may the sellers sue? Both the developer \nand the agents are liable. That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there \nwas a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may \nstill recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior \nto winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the \nplaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway. Similarly, if the \nseller sues the principal and recovers a judgment, the agents are relieved of liability. The seller thus has a \n“right of election” to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, a right that in many states may be \nexercised any time before the seller collects on the judgment. \n \n \nLack of Authority in Agent \nAn agent who purports to make a contract on behalf of a principal, but who in fact has no authority to do \nso, is liable to the other party. The theory is that the agent has warranted to the third party that he has the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n434 \nrequisite authority. The principal is not liable in the absence of apparent authority or ratification. But the \nagent does not warrant that the principal has capacity. Thus an agent for a minor is not liable on a \ncontract that the minor later disavows unless the agent expressly warranted that the principal had \nattained his majority. In short, the implied warranty is that the agent has authority to make a deal, not \nthat the principal will necessarily comply with the contract once the deal is made. \n \nAgent Acting on Own Account \nAn agent will be liable on contracts made in a personal capacity—for instance, when the agent personally \nguarantees repayment of a debt. The agent’s intention to be personally liable is often difficult to determine \non the basis of his signature on a contract. Generally, a person signing a contract can avoid personal \nliability only by showing that he was in fact signing as an agent. If the contract is signed “Jones, Agent,” \nJones can introduce evidence to show that there was never an intention to hold him personally liable. But \nif he signed “Jones” and neither his agency nor the principal’s name is included, he will be personally \nliable. This can be troublesome to agents who routinely indorse checks and notes. There are special rules \ngoverning these situations, which are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\" dealing with \ncommercial paper. \n \nTermination of Agency \nThe agency relationship is not permanent. Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the",

Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the \nend of three months” or “on midnight, December 31”). An agreement may also terminate on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n435 \naccomplishment of a specified act (“on the sale of the house”) or following a specific event (“at the \nconclusion of the last horse race”). \n \nMutual consent between the parties will end the agency. Moreover, the principal may revoke the agency or \nthe agent may renounce it; such a revocation or renunciation of agency would be an express \ntermination. Even a contract that states the agreement is irrevocable will not be binding, although it can \nbe the basis for a damage suit against the one who breached the agreement by revoking or renouncing it. \nAs with any contract, a person has the power to breach, even in absence of the right to do so. If the agency \nis coupled with an interest, however, so that the authority to act is given to secure an interest that the \nagent has in the subject matter of the agency, then the principal lacks the power to revoke the agreement. \n \nImplied Termination \nThere are a number of other circumstances that will spell the end of the relationship by implication. \nUnspecified events or changes in business conditions or the value of the subject matter of the agency \nmight lead to a reasonable inference that the agency should be terminated or suspended; for example, the \nprincipal desires the agent to buy silver but the silver market unexpectedly rises and silver doubles in \nprice overnight. Other circumstances that end the agency include disloyalty of the agent (e.g., he accepts \nan appointment that is adverse to his first principal or embezzles from the principal), bankruptcy of the \nagent or of the principal, the outbreak of war (if it is reasonable to infer that the principal, knowing of the \nwar, would not want the agent to continue to exercise authority), and a change in the law that makes a \ncontinued carrying out of the task illegal or seriously interferes with it. \n \n \nBy Operation of Law \nAside from the express termination (by agreement of both or upon the insistence of one), or the necessary \nor reasonable inferences that can be drawn from their agreements, the law voids agencies under certain \ncircumstances. The most frequent termination by operation of law is the death of a principal or an agent. \nThe death of an agent also terminates the authority of subagents he has appointed, unless the principal \nhas expressly consented to the continuing validity of their appointment. Similarly, if the agent or principal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n436 \nloses capacity to enter into an agency relationship, it is suspended or terminated. The agency terminates if \nits purpose becomes illegal. \n \nEven though authority has terminated, whether by action of the parties or operation of law, the principal \nmay still be subject to liability. Apparent authority in many instances will still exist; this is \ncalled lingering authority. It is imperative for a principal on termination of authority to notify all those \nwho may still be in a position to deal with the agent. The only exceptions to this requirement are when \ntermination is effected by death, loss of the principal’s capacity, or an event that would make it impossible \nto carry out the object of the agency. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA person is always liable for her own torts, so an agent who commits a tort is liable; if the tort was in the \nscope of employment the principal is liable too. Unless the principal put the agent up to committing the tort, \nthe agent will have to reimburse the principal. An agent is not generally liable for contracts made; the \nprincipal is liable. But the agent will be liable if he is undisclosed or partially disclosed, if the agent lacks \nauthority or exceeds it, or, of course, if the agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. \nAgencies terminate expressly or impliedly or by operation of law. An agency terminates expressly by the terms \nof the agreement or mutual consent, or by the principal’s revocation or the agent’s renunciation. An agency \nterminates impliedly by any number of circumstances in which it is reasonable to assume one or both of the \nparties would not want the relationship to continue. An agency will terminate by operation of law when one",

            "chunk": "Termination, loosely speaking, refers either to how the entity’s life as a business ends (continuity of life) \nor to how a member’s interest in the firm ends—that is, how freely the interest is transferable. \n \nContinuity of Life \nThe first step in the termination of the LLC is dissolution, though dissolution is not necessarily followed \nby termination. \n \nDissolution and Winding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n561 \nThe IRS has determined that continuity of life does not exist “if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, \nretirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization,” [1] and \nthat if one of these events occurs, the entity may continue only with the members’ unanimous consent. \nDissolution may occur even if the business is continued by the remaining members. \n \nThe typical LLC statute provides that an LLC will dissolve upon (1) expiration of the LLC’s term as per its \nagreement; (2) events specified in the agreement; (3) written consent of all members; (4) an “event of \ndissociation” of a member, unless within ninety days of the event all remaining members agree to \ncontinue, or the right to continue is stated in the LLC; (5) the entry of a judicial decree of dissolution; (6) a \nchange in membership that results in there being fewer than two members; or (7) the expiration of two \nyears after the effective date of administrative dissolution. \n \nAnd an “event of dissociation” is typically defined as (1) a member’s voluntary withdrawal, (2) her \nassignment of the entire LLC interest, (3) her expulsion, (4) her bankruptcy, (5) her becoming \nincompetent, (6) dissolution of an entity member (as an LLC, limited partnership, or corporation), or (7) \nany other event specified in the agreement. \n \nThus under most statutes’ default position, if a member dies, becomes insane or bankrupt, retires, resigns, \nor is expelled, the LLC will dissolve unless within ninety days the rest of the members unanimously agree \nto continue. And by this means the firm does not have continuity of life. Some states provide \nopportunities for even more flexibility regarding the “unanimous” part. In the mid-1990s, the IRS issued \nrevenue rulings (as opposed to regulations) that it would be enough if a “majority in interest” of \nremaining partners agreed to continue the business, and the “flexible” statute states adopted this \npossibility (the ones that did not are called “bulletproof” statutes). “Majority in interests” means a \nmajority of profits and capital. \n \nIf the firm does dissolve, some states require public filings to that effect. If dissolution leads to winding \nup, things progress as in a general partnership: the business at hand is finished, accounts are rendered, \nbills paid, assets liquidated, and remaining assets are distributed to creditors (including member and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n562 \nmanager creditors, but not for their shares in profits); to members and past members for unpaid \ndistributions; to members for capital contributions; and to members as agreed or in proportion to \ncontributions made. Upon dissolution, actual authority of members or managers terminates except as \nneeded to wind up; members may have apparent authority, though, unless the third party had notice of \nthe dissolution. \n \nFree Transferability of Interest \nAgain, the problem here is that if a member’s interest in the LLC is as freely transferable as a \nshareholder’s interest in a corporation (an owner can transfer all attributes of his interest without the \nothers’ consent), the LLC will probably be said to have a check mark in the “corporate-like” box: too many \nof those and the firm will not be allowed pass-through taxation. Thus the trick for the LLC promoters is to \nlimit free transferability enough to pass the test of not being a corporation, but not limit so much as to \nmake it really difficult to divest oneself of the interest (then it’s not a very liquid or desirable investment). \n \nSome states’ LLC statutes have as the default rule that the remaining members must unanimously consent \nto allow an assignee or a transferee of a membership interest to participate in managing the LLC. Since \nthis prevents a member from transferring all attributes of the interest (the right to participate in \nmanagement isn’t transferred or assigned), the LLC formed under the default provision will not have “free \ntransferability of interest.” But if the LLC agreement allows majority consent for the transfer of all \nattributes, that also would satisfy the requirement that there not be free transferability of interests. Then \nwe get into the question of how to define “majority”: by number of members or by value of their \nmembership? And what if only the managing partners need to consent? Or if there are two classes of \nmembership and the transfer of interests in one class requires the consent of the other? The point is that \npeople keep pushing the boundaries to see how close their LLC can come to corporation-like status \nwithout being called a corporation.",

However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589 \nNew Jersey led the way in 1875 with a general incorporation statute that greatly liberalized the powers of \nmanagement and lifted many of the former restrictions. The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by \nDelaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present \nday there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an \naddress on file with the secretary of state in Dover. \n \nDuring the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform \nBusiness Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws. About half of the states have adopted all or major portions of the act. The \n2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to \nthroughout our discussion of corporation law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of \nfinancial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-\nseventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England. The English Parliament successfully enacted the Bubble \nAct in 1720 to curb the formation of these companies; the restrictions weren’t loosened until over one \nhundred years later, after England viewed the success of corporations in its former colonies.

Because the various steps are complex, the formal prerequisites are not always met. \nSuppose that a company, thinking its incorporation has taken place when in fact it hasn’t met all \nrequirements, starts up its business. What then? Is everything it does null and void? If three conditions \nexist, a court might decide that a de facto corporation has been formed; that is, the business will be \nrecognized as a corporation. The state then has the power to force the de facto corporation to correct the \ndefect(s) so that a de jure corporation will be created. \n \nThe three traditional conditions are the following: (1) a statute must exist under which the corporation \ncould have been validly incorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a bona fide attempt to comply \nwith the statute, and (3) corporate powers must have been used or exercised. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n610 \nA frequent cause of defective incorporation is the promoters’ failure to file the articles of incorporation in \nthe appropriate public office. The states are split on whether a de facto corporation results if every other \nlegal requirement is met. \n \nCorporation by Estoppel \nEven if the incorporators omit important steps, it is still possible for a court, under estoppel principles, to \ntreat the business as a corporation. Assume that Bob, Carol, and Ted have sought to incorporate the BCT \nBookstore, Inc., but have failed to file the articles of incorporation. At the initial directors’ meeting, Carol \nturns over to the corporation a deed to her property. A month later, Bob discovers the omission and \nhurriedly submits the articles of incorporation to the appropriate public office. Carol decides she wants \nher land back. It is clear that the corporation was not de jure at the time she surrendered her deed, and it \nwas probably not de facto either. Can she recover the land? Under equitable principles, the answer is no. \nShe is estopped from denying the existence of the corporation, because it would be inequitable to permit \none who has conducted herself as though there were a corporation to deny its existence in order to defeat \na contract into which she willingly entered.

In Chapter 17 \"Securities \nRegulation\", we will continue discussion of officers’ and directors’ liability within the context of \nsecurities regulation and insider trading. \n \n \n \n16.1 Powers of a Corporation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the two types of corporate power. \n2. Consider the ramifications when a corporation acts outside its prescribed powers. \n3. Review legal issues surrounding corporate actions. \n \n \n \nTwo Types of Corporate Powers \nA corporation generally has three parties sharing power and control: directors, officers, and shareholders. \nDirectors are the managers of the corporation, and officers control the day-to-day decisions and work \nmore closely with the employees. The shareholders are the owners of the corporation, but they have little \ndecision-making authority. The corporation itself has powers; while a corporation is not the same as a \nperson (e.g., a corporation cannot be put in prison), it is allowed to conduct certain activities and has been \ngranted certain rights. \n \nExpress Powers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n668 \nThe corporation may exercise all powers expressly given it by statute and by its articles of incorporation. \nSection 3.02 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) sets out a number \nof express powers, including the following: to sue and be sued in the corporate name; to purchase, use, \nand sell land and dispose of assets to the same extent a natural person can; to make contracts, borrow \nmoney, issue notes and bonds, lend money, invest funds, make donations to the public welfare, and \nestablish pension plans; and to join in partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, or other enterprises. The \npowers set out in this section need not be included in the articles of incorporation. \n \nImplied Powers \nCorporate powers beyond those explicitly established are implied powers. For example, suppose BCT \nBookstore, Inc.’s statement of purpose reads simply, “to operate a bookstore.” The company may lawfully \nconduct all acts that are necessary or appropriate to running a bookstore—hiring employees, advertising \nspecial sales, leasing trucks, and so forth. Could Ted, its vice president and general manager, authorize the \nexpenditure of funds to pay for a Sunday afternoon lecture on the perils of nuclear war or the adventures \nof a professional football player? Yes—if the lectures are relevant to current books on sale or serve to bring \npeople into the store, they comply with the corporation’s purpose. \n \n \nThe Ultra Vires Doctrine \nThe law places limitations upon what acts a corporation may undertake. Corporations cannot do anything \nthey wish, but rather, must act within the prescribed rules as laid out in statute, case law, their articles of \nincorporation, and their bylaws. Sometimes, though, a corporation will step outside its permitted power \n(literally “beyond the powers). The ultra vires doctrine holds that certain legal consequences attach to \nan attempt by a corporation to carry out acts that are outside its lawful powers. Ultra vires (literally \n“beyond the powers”) is not limited to illegal acts, although it encompasses actions barred by statute as \nwell as by the corporate charter. Under the traditional approach, either the corporation or the other party \ncould assert ultra vires as a defense when refusing to abide by a wholly executory contract. The ultra vires \ndoctrine loses much of its significance when corporate powers are broadly stated in a corporation’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n669 \narticles. Furthermore, RMBCA Section 3.04 states that “the validity of corporate action may not be \nchallenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.” \n \nNonetheless, ultra vires acts are still challenged in courts today. For example, particularly in the area of \nenvironmental law, plaintiffs are challenging corporate environmental actions as ultra vires. Delaware \ncorporation law states that the attorney general shall revoke the charter of a corporation for illegal acts. \nAdditionally, the Court of Chancery of Delaware has jurisdiction to forfeit or revoke a corporate charter \nfor abuse of corporate powers. [1] See Adam Sulkowski’s “Ultra Vires Statutes: Alive, Kicking, and a Means \nof Circumventing the Scalia Standing Gauntlet.” [2] \n \nIn essence, ultra vires retains force in three circumstances: \n \n1. Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3. The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670",

The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors. In that case, if the articles of incorporation \nso provide, the board may be divided into two or three roughly equal classes and their terms staggered, so \nthat the second class is elected at the second annual meeting and the third at the third annual meeting. A \nstaggered board allows for the continuity of directors or as a defense against a hostile takeover. \n \nDirectors’ Qualifications and Characteristics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n682 \nThe statutes do not catalog qualifications that directors are expected to possess. In most states, directors \nneed not be residents of the state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles of \nincorporation or bylaws, which may also set down more precise qualifications if desired. \n \nUntil the 1970s, directors tended to be a homogeneous lot: white male businessmen or lawyers. Political \nchange—rising consumer, environmental, and public interest consciousness—and embarrassment \nstemming from disclosures made in the wake of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \ninvestigations growing out of Watergate prompted companies to diversify their boardrooms. Today, \nmembers of minority groups and women are being appointed in increasing numbers, although their \nproportion to the total is still small. Outside directors (directors who are not employees, officers, or \notherwise associated with the corporation; they are also called nonexecutive directors) are becoming a \npotent force on corporate boards. The trend to promote the use of outside directors has continued—the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 places emphasis on the use of outside directors to provide balance to the \nboard and protect the corporation’s investors. \n \nRemoval of Directors and Officers \nIn 1978, one week before he was scheduled to unveil the 1979 Mustang to trade journalists in person, Lee \nIacocca, president of the Ford Motor Company, was summarily fired by unanimous vote of the board of \ndirectors, although his departure was billed as a resignation. Iacocca was reported to have asked company \nchairman Henry Ford II, “What did I do wrong?” To which Ford was said to have replied, “I just don’t like \nyou.” [1] To return to our usual example: BCT Bookstore is set to announce its acquisition of Borders \nGroup, Inc., a large book retailer that is facing bankruptcy. Alice, one of BCT’s directors, was instrumental \nin the acquisition. One day prior to the announcement of the acquisition, BCT’s board relieved Alice of her \ndirectorship, providing no reason for the decision. The story raises this question: May a corporate officer, \nor director for that matter, be fired without cause? \n \nYes. Many state statutes expressly permit the board to fire an officer with or without cause. However, \nremoval does not defeat an officer’s rights under an employment contract. Shareholders may remove \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n683 \ndirectors with or without cause at any meeting called for the purpose. A majority of the shares entitled to \nvote, not a majority of the shares represented at the meeting, are required for removal. \n \nMeetings \nDirectors must meet, but the statutes themselves rarely prescribe how frequently. More often, rules \nprescribing time and place are set out in the bylaws, which may permit members to participate in any \nmeeting by conference telephone. In practice, the frequency of board meetings varies. \n \nThe board or committees of the board may take action without meeting if all members of the board or \ncommittee consent in writing. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum, unless the \nbylaws or articles of incorporation specify a larger number. Likewise, a majority present at the meeting is \nsufficient to carry any motion unless the articles or bylaws specify a larger number. \n \nCompensation \nIn the past, directors were supposed to serve without pay, as shareholder representatives. The modern \npractice is to permit the board to determine its own pay unless otherwise fixed in the articles of \nincorporation. Directors’ compensation has risen sharply in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, however, has made significant changes to compensation, \nallowing shareholders a “say on pay,” or the ability to vote on compensation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe directors exercise corporate powers.

Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination. We address separately those two categories and the issues that \nthey generate.… \n \n…[The due care] argument is best understood against the backdrop of the presumptions that cloak \ndirector action being reviewed under the business judgment standard. Our law presumes that “in making \na business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the \nhonest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Those presumptions can be \nrebutted if the plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted \nin bad faith. If that is shown, the burden then shifts to the director defendants to demonstrate that the \nchallenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders.… \n \nThe appellants’ first claim is that the Chancellor erroneously (i) failed to make a “threshold \ndetermination” of gross negligence, and (ii) “conflated” the appellants’ burden to rebut the business \njudgment presumptions, with an analysis of whether the directors’ conduct fell within the 8 Del. C. § \n102(b)(7) provision that precludes exculpation of directors from monetary liability “for acts or omissions \nnot in good faith.” The argument runs as follows: Emerald Partners v. Berlin required the Chancellor first \nto determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted based upon a showing that \nthe board violated its duty of care, i.e., acted with gross negligence. If gross negligence were established, \nthe burden would shift to the directors to establish that the OEA was entirely fair. Only if the directors \nfailed to meet that burden could the trial court then address the directors’ Section 102(b)(7) exculpation \ndefense, including the statutory exception for acts not in good faith. \n \nThis argument lacks merit. To make the argument the appellants must ignore the distinction between (i) a \ndetermination of bad faith for the threshold purpose of rebutting the business judgment rule \npresumptions, and (ii) a bad faith determination for purposes of evaluating the availability of charter-\nauthorized exculpation from monetary damage liability after liability has been established. Our law clearly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n703 \npermits a judicial assessment of director good faith for that former purpose. Nothing in Emerald \nPartners requires the Court of Chancery to consider only evidence of lack of due care (i.e. gross \nnegligence) in determining whether the business judgment rule presumptions have been rebutted.… \n \nThe appellants argue that the Disney directors breached their duty of care by failing to inform themselves \nof all material information reasonably available with respect to Ovitz’s employment agreement.…[but the] \nonly properly reviewable action of the entire board was its decision to elect Ovitz as Disney’s President. In \nthat context the sole issue, as the Chancellor properly held, is “whether [the remaining members of the old \nboard] properly exercised their business judgment and acted in accordance with their fiduciary duties \nwhen they elected Ovitz to the Company’s presidency.” The Chancellor determined that in electing Ovitz, \nthe directors were informed of all information reasonably available and, thus, were not grossly negligent. \nWe agree. \n \n…[The court turns to good faith.] The Court of Chancery held that the business judgment rule \npresumptions protected the decisions of the compensation committee and the remaining Disney \ndirectors, not only because they had acted with due care but also because they had not acted in bad faith. \nThat latter ruling, the appellants claim, was reversible error because the Chancellor formulated and then \napplied an incorrect definition of bad faith. \n \n…Their argument runs as follows: under the Chancellor’s 2003 definition of bad faith, the directors must \nhave “consciously and intentionally disregarded their responsibilities, adopting a ‘we don’t care about \nthe risks’ attitude concerning a material corporate decision.” Under the 2003 formulation, appellants say, \n“directors violate their duty of good faith if they are making material decisions without adequate \ninformation and without adequate deliberation[,]” but under the 2005 post-trial definition, bad faith \nrequires proof of a subjective bad motive or intent. This definitional change, it is claimed, was \nprocedurally prejudicial because appellants relied on the 2003 definition in presenting their evidence of \nbad faith at the trial.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits. The law applies to any company with more than $10 million in assets and at \nleast five hundred or more shareholders of any class of stock. \n \nSuppose that on January 1, Bob (a company officer) purchases one hundred shares of stock in BCT \nBookstore, Inc., for $60 a share. On September 1, he sells them for $100 a share. What is the result? Bob \nis in the clear, because his $4,000 profit was not realized during a six-month period. Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why? In August, Bob held one hundred shares of stock, and he did again on \nOctober 1—within a six-month period. His net gain on these transactions was $7,000 ($10,000 realized \non the sale less the $3,000 cost of the purchase). \n \nAs a consequence of Section 16(b) and certain other provisions, trading in securities by directors, officers, \nand large stockholders presents numerous complexities. For instance, the law requires people in this \nposition to make periodic reports to the SEC about their trades. As a practical matter, directors, officers, \nand large shareholders should not trade in their own company stock in the short run without legal advice. \n \nInsider Trading: Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits any person from using the mails or \nfacilities of interstate commerce “to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any \nsecurity…any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and \nregulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the \nprotection of investors.” In 1942, the SEC learned of a company president who misrepresented the \ncompany’s financial condition in order to buy shares at a low price from current stockholders. So the \ncommission adopted a rule under the authority of Section 10(b). Rule 10b-5, as it was dubbed, has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n727 \nremained unchanged for more than forty years and has spawned thousands of lawsuits and SEC \nproceedings.

Negotiability means that the paper is freely and unconditionally transferable from one \nperson to another by delivery or by delivery and indorsement. (“Indorsement,” not “endorsement,” is the \nspelling used in the UCC, though the latter is more common in nonlegal usage.) Without the ability to pay \nand finance through commercial paper, the business world would be paralyzed. At bottom, negotiability is \nthe means by which a person is empowered to transfer to another more than what the transferor himself \npossesses. In essence, this is the power to convey to a transferee the right in turn to convey clear title, \nwhen the original transferor does not have clear title. \n \nOverview of Chapters on Commercial Paper \nIn this chapter, we examine the history and nature of commercial paper and define the types of parties \n(persons who have an interest in the paper) and the types of instruments. We then proceed to four \nfundamental issues that must be addressed to determine whether parties such as First Bank, in the \npreceding example, can collect: \n1. Is the paper negotiable? That is, is the paper in the proper form? We explore that issue in this \nchapter. \n2. Was the paper negotiated properly? See Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n778 \n3. Is the purchaser of the paper a holder in due course? See Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and \nDefenses\". \n4. Does the maker of the paper have available any defenses against even the holder in due course? \nSee Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \nIn most transactions, especially when the first three questions are answered affirmatively, the purchaser \nwill have little trouble collecting. But when the purchaser is unable to collect, questions of liability arise. \nThese questions, along with termination of liability, are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". \n \nFinally, in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\" we examine other legal aspects of banking, including \nletters of credit and electronic funds transfer. \n \nHistory of Commercial Paper \nDevelopment of the Law \nNegotiable instruments are no modern invention; we know that merchants used them as long ago as the \nage of Hammurabi, around 1700 BC. They fell into disuse after the collapse of the Roman Empire and \nthen reappeared in Italy around the fourteenth century. They became more common as long-distance \ncommerce spread. In an era before paper currency, payment in coins or bullion was awkward, especially \nfor merchants who traveled great distances across national boundaries to attend the fairs at which most \neconomic exchanges took place. Merchants and traders found it far more efficient to pay with paper. \n \nBills of exchange, today commonly known as drafts, were recognized instruments in the law merchant. \n(The “law merchant” was the system of rules and customs recognized and adopted by early-modern \ntraders and is the basis of the UCC Article 3.) A draft is an unconditional order by one person (the drawer) \ndirecting another person (drawee or payor) to pay money to a named third person or to bearer; a check is \nthe most familiar type of draft. The international merchant courts regularly enforced drafts and permitted \nthem to be transferred to others by indorsement (the legal spelling of endorsement). By the beginning of \nthe sixteenth century, the British common-law courts began to hear cases involving bills of exchange, but \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n779 \nit took a half century before the courts became comfortable with them and accepted them as crucial to the \ngrowing economy. \n \nCourts were also hesitant until the end of the seventeenth century about sanctioning a transferor’s \nassignment of a promissory note if it meant that the transferee would have better title than the transferor. \nOne reason for the courts’ reluctance to sanction assignments stemmed from the law that permitted",

But a holder can \nalso be someone unnamed whom the original parties did not contemplate by name—for example, the \nholder of a bearer note. \n \nHolder in Due Course \nA holder in due course is a special type of holder who, if certain requirements are met, acquires rights \nbeyond those possessed by the transferor (we alluded to this in describing the significance of Lorna Love’s \nmaking of a negotiable—as opposed to a nonnegotiable—instrument). We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to \nanother party to the instrument. It does not matter in what capacity she signs, whether as maker or \ncomaker, drawer or codrawer, or indorser. As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay). The extent of the accommodation party’s liability to pay depends on whether she has \nadded language specifying her purposes in signing. Section 3-416 of the UCC distinguishes between a \nguaranty of payment and a guaranty of collection. An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment. Only if the \njudgment is unsatisfied can the holder seek to collect from the accommodation party.

The two basic types of \ncommercial paper are drafts and notes. The note is a two-party instrument whereby one person (maker) \npromises to pay money to a second person (payee). The draft is a three-party instrument whereby one person \n(drawer) directs a second (drawee) to pay money to the third (payee). Drafts may be sight drafts, payable on \nsight, or they may be time drafts, payable at a date specified on the draft. Checks are drafts drawn on banks. \nOther parties include indorser and indorsee, holder, holder in due course, and accommodation party. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Knapp, 19 N.W. 867 (IA 1884). \n[2] Uniform Commercial Code, Section 1-201(21). \n \n \n19.3 Requirements for Negotiability \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Know what is required for an instrument to be negotiable. \n \n \nOverview \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n790 \nWhether or not a paper is negotiable is the first of our four major questions, and it is one that nonlawyers \nmust confront. Auditors, retailers, and financial institutions often handle notes and checks and usually \nmust make snap judgments about negotiability. Unless the required elements of Sections 3-103 and 3-104 \nof the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) are met, the paper is not negotiable. Thus the paper meets the \nfollowing criteria: \n1. It must be in writing. \n2. It must be signed by the maker or drawer. \n3. It must be an unconditional promise or order to pay. \n4. It must be for a fixed amount in money. \n5. It must be payable on demand or at a definite time. \n6. It must be payable to order or bearer, unless it is a check. \n \nThis definition states the basic premise of a negotiable instrument: the holder must be able to ascertain all \nessential terms from the face of the instrument. \nAnalysis of Required Elements \nIn Writing \nUnder UCC Section 1-201, “written” or “writing” includes “printing, typewriting or any other intentional \nreduction to tangible form.” That definition is broad—so broad, in fact, that from time to time the \nnewspapers report checks written on material ranging from a girdle (an Ohio resident wanted to make his \ntax payment stretch) to granite. Since these are tangible materials, the checks meet the writing \nrequirement. The writing can be made in any medium: ink, pencil, or even spray paint, as was the case \nwith the granite check. Of course, there is a danger in using pencil or an ink that can be erased, since the \ndrawer might be liable for alterations. For example, if you write out in pencil a check for $10 and someone \nerases your figures and writes in $250, you may lose your right to protest when the bank cashes it. \n \nSigned by the Maker or Drawer \nSignature is not limited to the personal handwriting of one’s name. “Any symbol executed or adopted by a \nparty with present intention to authenticate a writing” will serve.

The Fictitious Payee Rule \nLunny made the fraudulent checks payable to actual vendors of Victory with the intention that the \nvendors not get paid. Wachovia therefore argues that Victory’s action against it should be barred by the \nfictitious payee rule under UCC 3-404 [which] states, in relevant part: \n \n(b) Fictitious Payee. If a person…does not intend the person identified as payee to have any \ninterest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, \nthe following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement: \n(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder. \n(2) An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as \nthe indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes \nit for value or for collection.… \n \nThe theory under the rule is that since the indorsement is “effective,” the drawee bank was justified in \ndebiting the company’s account. Therefore, [Wachovia argues] the loss should fall on the company whose \nemployee committed the fraud. \n \n…[However] under revised UCC §§ 3-404 and 3-405, the fictitious payee defense triggers principles of \ncomparative fault, so a depositary bank’s own negligence may be considered by the trier of \nfact.…Therefore, based on the foregoing reasons, the fictitious payee defense does not help Wachovia in \nthis case. \n \n \n \nIV. Allocation of Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n840 \nAs stated supra, comparative negligence applies in this case because of the revisions in the Code. In \ndetermining the liability of the parties, the Court has considered, inter alia [among other things], the \nfollowing factors: \n \n• \nAt the time of the fraud by Lunny, Wachovia’s policies and regulations regarding the acceptance \nof checks for deposit provided that “checks payable to a non-personal payee can be deposited \nONLY into a non-personal account with the same name.” [Emphasis in original] \n• \nApproximately two hundred (200) checks drawn on Victory’s corporate account were deposited \ninto Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. \n• \nThe first twenty-three (23) fraudulent checks were made payable to entities that were not readily \ndistinguishable as businesses, such as “Sean John.” The check dated December 17, 2001 was the \nfirst fraudulent check made payable to a payee that was clearly a business, specifically “Beverly \nHills Shoes, Inc.” \n• \nIn 2001, Victory had approximately seventeen (17) employees, including Lunny. \n• \nLunny had been a bookkeeper for Victory from approximately 1982 until she resigned in May \n2003. Rosenfeld never had any problems with Lunny’s bookkeeping before she resigned. \n• \nLunny exercised primary control over Victory’s bank accounts. \n• \nBetween 2001 and 2003, the checks that were generated to make payments to Victory’s vendors \nwere all computerized checks generated by Lunny. No other Victory employee, other than Lunny, \nknew how to generate the computerized checks, including Rosenfeld. \n• \nThe fraudulent checks were made payable to known vendors of Victory in amounts that were \nconsistent with previous legitimate checks to those vendors. \n• \nAfter forging the indorsement of the payee, Lunny either indorsed the check with her name \nfollowed by her account number, or referenced her account number following the forged \nindorsement. \n• \nAbout ten (10) out of approximately three hundred (300) checks each month were forged by \nLunny and deposited into her personal account. \n• \nRosenfeld reviewed his bank statements from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n841 \n• \nRosenfeld received copies of Victory’s cancelled checks from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nHowever, the copies of the cancelled checks were not in their normal size; instead, they were \nsmaller, with six checks (front and back side) on each page. \n• \nThe forged indorsements were written out in longhand, i.e., Lunny’s own handwriting, rather \nthan a corporate stamped signature. \n• \nVictory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each month. \n• \nAn outside accounting firm performed quarterly reviews of Victory’s bookkeeping records, and \nthen met with Rosenfeld. This review was not designed to pick up fraud or misappropriation. \n \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Victory and Wachovia are comparatively negligent. \n \nWith regard to Wachovia’s negligence, it is clear that Wachovia was negligent in violating its own rules in \nrepeatedly depositing corporate checks into Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. Standard commercial \nbank procedures dictate that a check made payable to a business be accepted only into a business \nchecking account with the same title as the business. Had a single teller at Wachovia followed Wachovia’s",

After being informed by both [Respondent’s] teller and \nbranch manager that it was [Respondent’s] policy not to cash a non-account holder’s check \nwithout a thumbprint signature, [Petitioner] left the bank with the check in hand. \n \nBecause [Petitioner] gave the check to the teller, [Respondent’s] possession of that check was \nanything but “unauthorized,” and having returned the check, within minutes of its receipt, to \n[Petitioner] for his thumbprint signature, [Respondent] never exercised “dominion and control \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n921 \n[over it] to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor,” [Petitioner]. In short, there was no \nconversion. \n \nD. “Reasonable Identification” under § 3-501(b)(2)(ii) and “Dishonor” under § 3-502 \n \nWe now turn to the issue of whether the Bank’s refusal to accept the check as presented constituted \ndishonor under § 3-501 and § 3-502 as Petitioner contends. Petitioner’s argument that Bank of America \ndishonored the check under § 3-502(d) fails because that section applies to dishonor of an accepted draft. \nWe have determined, supra, [above] that Bank of America never accepted the draft. Nevertheless, the \nquestion remains as to whether Bank of America dishonored the draft under § 3-502(b)… \n \n(2) Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is made, the person making presentment \nmust (i) exhibit the instrument, (ii) give reasonable identification… \n \n(3) Without dishonoring the instrument, the party to whom presentment is made may (i) return \nthe instrument for lack of a necessary indorsement, or (ii) refuse payment or acceptance for \nfailure of the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the \nparties, or other applicable law or rule. \n \nThe question is whether requiring a thumbprint constitutes a request for “reasonable identification” \nunder § 3-501(b)(2)(ii). If it is “reasonable,” then under § 3-501(b)(3)(ii) the refusal of the Bank to accept \nthe check from Petitioner did not constitute dishonor. If, however, requiring a thumbprint is not \n“reasonable” under § 3-501(b)(2)(ii), then the refusal to accept the check may constitute dishonor under § \n3-502(b)(2). The issue of dishonor is arguably relevant because Petitioner has no cause of action against \nany party, including the drawer, until the check is dishonored. \n \nRespondent Bank of America argues that its relationship with its customer is contractual, [Citations] and \nthat in this case, its contract with its customer, the drawer, authorizes the Bank’s use of the Thumbprint \nSignature Program as a reasonable form of identification. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n922 \n \nAccording to Respondent, this contractual agreement allowed it to refuse to accept the check, without \ndishonoring it pursuant to § 3-501(b)(3)(ii), because the Bank’s refusal was based upon the presentment \nfailing to comply with “an agreement of the parties.” The intermediate appellate court agreed. We, \nhowever, do not. \n \n…Bank and its customer cannot through their contract define the meaning of the term “reasonable” and \nimpose it upon parties who are not in privity with that contract. Whether requiring a thumbprint \nconstitutes “reasonable identification” within the meaning of § 3-501(b)(2)(ii) is therefore a broader \npolicy consideration, and not, as argued in this case, simply a matter of contract. We reiterate that the \ncontract does not apply to Petitioner and, similarly, does not give him a cause of action against the Bank \nfor refusing to accept the check. This also means that the Bank cannot rely on the contract as a defense \nagainst the Petitioner, on the facts presented here, to say that it did not dishonor the check. \n \nPetitioner, as noted, argues that requiring a thumbprint violates his privacy, and further argues that a \nthumbprint is not a reasonable form of identification because it does not prove contemporaneously the \nidentity of an over the counter presenter at the time presentment is made. According to Petitioner, the \npurpose of requiring “reasonable identification” is to allow the drawee bank to determine that the \npresenter is the proper person to be paid on the instrument. Because a thumbprint does not provide that \ninformation at the time presentment and payment are made, Petitioner argues that a thumbprint cannot \nbe read to fall within the meaning of “reasonable identification” for the purposes of § 3-501(b)(2)(ii). \n \nBank of America argues that the requirement of a thumbprint has been upheld, in other non-criminal \ncircumstances, not to be an invasion of privacy, and is a reasonable and necessary industry response to \nthe growing problem of check fraud.

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount. On Thursday, the Bank deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade’s account. \n \nIn the meanwhile, Meade contacted Greg Scott at the Lumber Company regarding his dissatisfaction with \nthe barn. Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn.

However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn. Baker charged Meade approximately three hundred dollars to make \nthe necessary repairs. Baker testified that properly laminated two by six-inch boards are just as strong as \nfour by six-inch boards. \n \nMeade filed suit against the Bank in the trial court seeking $5,000 in damages.

Specifically, the Bank asserts that Meade did not issue the stop payment order within \na reasonable time for the Bank to act upon it, and therefore that the trial court should have granted \nsummary judgment in favor of the Bank. \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate only when it has been established: (1) that there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that \nreasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving \nparty. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n967 \n[UCC 4-403(A)] provides that a customer may stop payment on any item drawn on the customer’s \naccount by issuing an order to the bank that describes the item with reasonable certainty and is received \nby the bank “at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before \nany action by the bank with respect to the item.” What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the \nfacts of the case. See Chute v. Bank One of Akron, (1983) [Citation] \n \nIn Chute, Bank One alleged that its customer, Mr. Chute, did not give it a reasonable opportunity to act \nupon his stop payment order when he gave an oral stop payment at one Bank One branch office, and a \ndifferent Bank One branch office paid the check the following day. In ruling that Bank One had a \nreasonable opportunity to act upon Mr. Chute’s order before it paid the check, the court considered the \nteller’s testimony that stop payment orders are entered onto the computer upon receipt, where they are \nvirtually immediately accessible to all Bank One tellers. \n \nIn this case, as in Chute, Meade gave notice one day, and the Bank paid the check the following day. \nAdditionally, in this case, the same branch that took the stop payment order also paid the check. \nMoreover, Evans testified that the Bank’s policy for stop payment orders is to enter them into the \ncomputer immediately, and that Meade’s stop payment order may have shown up on the computer on \nSaturday if she had entered it on Friday. Based on this information, and construing the facts in the light \nmost favorable to Meade, reasonable minds could conclude that Meade provided the Bank with the stop \npayment order within time for the Bank to act upon the stop payment order. Accordingly, we overrule the \nBank’s first assignment of error. \n \nIII. \nIn its second assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in permitting Meade to \ntestify regarding the amount he spent on court costs, attorney fees, and taking depositions. Meade \ncontends that because he incurred these costs as a result of the Bank paying his check over a valid stop \npayment order, the costs are properly recoverable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n968 \nAs a general rule, the costs and expenses of litigation, other than court costs, are not recoverable in an \naction for damages.

The Bank moved for a directed verdict both at the conclusion of Meade’s \ncase and at the close of evidence. \n \nThe Bank first asserts that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to show that Meade issued a \nstop payment order that provided it with a reasonable opportunity to act as required by [the UCC]. Meade \npresented evidence that he gave the Bank his stop payment order prior to 6:00 p.m. on Friday, and that \nthe Bank paid the check the following day.…We find that this constitutes sufficient evidence that Meade \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n969 \ncommunicated the stop payment order to the Bank in time to allow the Bank a reasonable opportunity to \nact upon it. \n \nThe Bank also asserts that the record does not contain sufficient evidence that Meade incurred some loss \nresulting from its payment of the check. Pursuant to [UCC 4-403(c)] “[t]he burden of establishing the fact \nand amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop payment order or order to \nclose an account is on the customer.” Establishing the fact and amount of loss, “the customer must show \nsome loss other than the mere debiting of the customer’s account.” [Citation] \n \n…Baker testified that he charged Meade between two hundred-eighty and three hundred dollars to \nproperly laminate the runners and support the barn. Based upon these facts, we find that the record \ncontains sufficient evidence that Meade sustained some loss beyond the mere debiting of his account as a \nresult of the Bank paying his check. Accordingly, we overrule the Bank’s third assignment of error. \n \nV. \n…In its final assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in denying its motions for \njudgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.… \n[U]nlike our consideration of the Bank’s motions for a directed verdict, in considering the Bank’s motion \nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we also must consider whether the amount of the jury’s award \nis supported by sufficient evidence. The Bank contends the jury’s general verdict, awarding Meade \n$3,800, is not supported by evidence in the record. \n \nA bank customer seeking damages for the improper payment of a check over a valid stop payment order \ncarries the burden of proving “the fact and amount of loss.” [UCC 4-403(C).] To protect banks and \nprevent unjust enrichment to customers, the mere debiting of the customer’s account does not constitute \na loss. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n970 \nIn this case, the Bank’s payment of Meade’s $1,406.79 check to the Lumber Company discharged Meade’s \ndebt to the Lumber Company in the same amount. Therefore, the mere debiting of $1,406.79 from \nMeade’s account does not constitute a loss. \n \nMeade presented evidence that he incurred $300 in repair costs to make the barn satisfactory. Meade also \nnotes that he never got the four by six-inch runners he wanted. However, Meade’s carpenter, Baker, \ntestified that since he properly laminated the two by six-inch runners, they are just as strong or stronger \nthan the four by six-inch runners would have been. \n \nMeade also presented evidence of his costs and fees. However, as we determined in our review of the \nBank’s second assignment of error, only the court may award costs and fees, and therefore this evidence \nwas improperly admitted. Thus, the evidence cannot support the damage award. Meade did not present \nany other evidence of loss incurred by the Bank’s payment of his check.…Therefore, we find that the trial \ncourt erred in declining to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of damages. Upon \nremand, the trial court should grant in part the Bank’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict",

Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why? Because with the first loan you will have the use of the full \n$1,000 for the entire year; with the second, for much less than the year because you must begin repaying \npart of the principal within a month. In fact, with the second loan you will have use of only about half the \nmoney for the entire year, and so the actual rate of interest is closer to 15 percent. Things become more \ncomplex when interest is compounded and stated as a monthly figure, when different rates apply to \nvarious portions of the loan, and when processing charges and other fees are stated separately. The act \nregulates open-end credit (revolving credit, like charge cards) and closed-end credit (like a car loan—\nextending for a specific period), and—as amended later—it regulates consumer leases and credit card \ntransactions, too. \nFigure 24.1 Credit Disclosure Form \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n990 \n \n \nBy requiring that the finance charge and the annual percentage rate be disclosed on a uniform basis, the \nTILA makes understanding and comparison of loans much easier. The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are",

[16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse \nreceipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the \nvalue. For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a \nsecurity interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse. If Deborah \ndefaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is \nentitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation. The warehouser will not let Carl have the \nchairs without the warehouse receipt—it’s indispensable paper. There are four kinds of indispensable \npaper. \n \nChattel Paper \nChattel is another word for goods. Chattel paper is a record (paper or electronic) that demonstrates both \n“a monetary obligation and a security interest either in certain goods or in a lease on certain \ngoods.” [17] The paper represents a valuable asset and can itself be used as collateral. For example, Creditor \nCar Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a \npurchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper). The chattel paper \nis not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from \nLift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to \nLift Co. The chattel paper is now collateral. Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic. \n \nDocuments \nThis category includes documents of title—bills of lading and warehouse receipts are examples. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1027 \n \nInstruments \nAn “instrument” here is “a negotiable instrument (checks, drafts, notes, certificates of deposit) or any \nother writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary obligation, is not itself a security \nagreement or lease, and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with \nany necessary indorsement or assignment.” “Instrument” does not include (i) investment property, (ii) \nletters of credit, or (iii) writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or \ncharge card or information contained on or for use with the card. [18] \n \nInvestment Property \nThis includes securities (stock, bonds), security accounts, commodity accounts, and commodity \ncontracts. [19] Securities may be certified (represented by a certificate) or uncertified (not represented by a \ncertificate).[20] \n \nOther Types of Collateral \nAmong possible other types of collateral that may be used as security is the floating lien. This is a \nsecurity interest in property that was not in the possession of the debtor when the security agreement was \nexecuted. The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and \nproceeds held by—most often—the business debtor. It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell \ntheir collateralized inventory. Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily \ndepleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers. Pretty soon, there’d be no security \nat all. The floating lien includes the following: \n• \nAfter-acquired property. This is property that the debtor acquires after the original deal was set \nup. It allows the secured party to enhance his security as the debtor (obligor) acquires more \nproperty subject to collateralization. \n• \nSale proceeds. These are proceeds from the disposition of the collateral. Carl Creditor takes a \nsecured interest in Deborah Debtor’s sailboat. She sells the boat and buys a garden tractor. The \nsecured interest attaches to the garden tractor. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1028 \n• \nFuture advances. Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause. The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a \n$700,000 inventory-picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor.

The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond \napplied for, and the applicant’s financial history. A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 \npercent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent \nand 20 percent of the bond amount. When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s \nmortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee \nreleases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults. \n \nCreation of the Suretyship \nSuretyship can arise only through contract. The general principles of contract law apply to suretyship. \nThus a person with the general capacity to contract has the power to become a surety. Consideration is \nrequired for a suretyship contract: if Debtor asks a friend to act as a surety to induce Creditor to make \nDebtor a loan, the consideration Debtor gives Creditor also acts as the consideration Friend gives. Where \nthe suretyship arises after Creditor has already extended credit, new consideration would be required \n(absent application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel [1]). You may recall from the chapters on \ncontracts that the promise by one person to pay or perform for the debts or defaults of another must be \nevidenced by a writing under the statute of frauds (subject to the “main purpose” exception). \n \nSuretyship contracts are affected to some extent by government regulation. Under a 1985 Federal Trade \nCommission Credit Practices Rule, creditors are prohibited from misrepresenting a surety’s liability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1057 \nCreditors must also give the surety a notice that explains the nature of the obligation and the potential \nliability that can arise if a person cosigns on another’s debt. [2] \n \nDuties and Rights of the Surety \nDuties of the Surety \nUpon the principal debtor’s default, the surety is contractually obligated to perform unless the principal \nherself or someone on her behalf discharges the obligation. When the surety performs, it must do so in \ngood faith. Because the principal debtor’s defenses are generally limited, and because—as will be noted—\nthe surety has the right to be reimbursed by the debtor, debtors not infrequently claim the surety acted in \nbad faith by doing things like failing to make an adequate investigation (to determine if the debtor really \ndefaulted), overpaying claims, interfering with the contact between the surety and the debtor, and making \nunreasonable refusals to let the debtor complete the project. The case Fidelity and Deposit Co. of \nMaryland v. Douglas Asphalt Co.,in Section 25.5 \"Cases\", is typical. \n \nRights of the Surety \nThe surety has four main rights stemming from its obligation to answer for the debt or default of the \nprincipal debtor. \n \n \n \nExoneration \nIf, at the time a surety’s obligation has matured, the principal can satisfy the obligation but refuses to do \nso, the surety is entitled to exoneration—a court order requiring the principal to perform. It would be \ninequitable to force the surety to perform and then to have to seek reimbursement from the principal if \nall along the principal is able to perform. \n \nReimbursement \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1058 \nIf the surety must pay the creditor because the principal has defaulted, the principal is obligated to \nreimburse the surety. The amount required to be reimbursed includes the surety’s reasonable, good-faith \noutlays, including interest and legal fees. \n \nSubrogation \nSuppose the principal’s duty to the creditor is fully satisfied and that the surety has contributed to this \nsatisfaction. Then the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor against the principal. \nIn other words, the surety stands in the creditor’s shoes and may assert against the principal whatever \nrights the creditor could have asserted had the duty not been discharged. The right \nof subrogation includes the right to take secured interests that the creditor obtained from the principal \nto cover the duty. Sarah’s Pizzeria owes Martha $5,000, and Martha has taken a security interest in \nSarah’s Chevrolet. Eva is surety for the debt. Sarah defaults, and Eva pays Martha the $5,000. Eva is \nentitled to have the security interest in the car transferred to her. \n \nContribution \nTwo or more sureties who are bound to answer for the principal’s default and who should share between \nthem the loss caused by the default are known as cosureties. A surety who in performing its own \nobligation to the creditor winds up paying more than its proportionate share is entitled to contribution \nfrom the cosureties. \n \n \n \nDefenses of the Parties \nThe principal and the surety may have defenses to paying. \n \nDefenses of the Principal",

Indeed, during the period leading up \nto the recession in 2007–08, a lot of people borrowed money on their houses to buy things: boats, new \ncars, furniture, and so on. Unfortunately, it turned out that some of the real estate used as collateral was \novervalued: when the economy weakened and people lost income or their jobs, they couldn’t make the \nmortgage payments. And, to make things worse, the value of the real estate sometimes sank too, so that \nthe debtors owed more on the property than it was worth (that’s called being underwater). They couldn’t \nsell without taking a loss, and they couldn’t make the payments. Some debtors just walked away, leaving \nthe banks with a large number of houses, commercial buildings, and even shopping centers on their \nhands. \n \nShort History of Mortgage Law \nThe mortgage has ancient roots, but the form we know evolved from the English land law in the Middle \nAges. Understanding that law helps to understand modern mortgage law. In the fourteenth century, the \nmortgage was a deed that actually transferred title to the mortgagee. If desired, the mortgagee could move \ninto the house, occupy the property, or rent it out. But because the mortgage obligated him to apply to the \nmortgage debt whatever rents he collected, he seldom ousted the mortgagor. Moreover, the mortgage set a \nspecific date (the “law day”) on which the debt was to be repaid. If the mortgagor did so, the mortgage \nbecame void and the mortgagor was entitled to recover the property. If the mortgagor failed to pay the \ndebt, the property automatically vested in the mortgagee. No further proceedings were necessary. \nThis law was severe. A day’s delay in paying the debt, for any reason, forfeited the land, and the courts \nstrictly enforced the mortgage. The only possible relief was a petition to the king, who over time referred \nthese and other kinds of petitions to the courts of equity. At first fitfully, and then as a matter of course \n(by the seventeenth century), the equity courts would order the mortgagee to return the land when the \nmortgagor stood ready to pay the debt plus interest. Thus a new right developed: the equitable right of \nredemption, known for short as the equity of redemption. In time, the courts held that this equity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1082 \nredemption was a form of property right; it could be sold and inherited. This was a powerful right: no \nmatter how many years later, the mortgagor could always recover his land by proffering a sum of money. \n \nUnderstandably, mortgagees did not warm to this interpretation of the law, because their property rights \nwere rendered insecure. They tried to defeat the equity of redemption by having mortgagors waive and \nsurrender it to the mortgagees, but the courts voided waiver clauses as a violation of public policy. Hence \na mortgage, once a transfer of title, became a security for debt. A mortgage as such can never be converted \ninto a deed of title. \n \nThe law did not rest there. Mortgagees won a measure of relief in the development of the foreclosure. \nOn default, the mortgagee would seek a court order giving the mortgagor a fixed time—perhaps six \nmonths or a year—within which to pay off the debt; under the court decree, failure meant that the \nmortgagor was forever foreclosed from asserting his right of redemption. This strict foreclosure gave \nthe mortgagee outright title at the end of the time period. \n \nIn the United States today, most jurisdictions follow a somewhat different approach: the mortgagee \nforecloses by forcing a public sale at auction. Proceeds up to the amount of the debt are the mortgagee’s to \nkeep; surplus is paid over to the mortgagor. Foreclosure by sale is the usual procedure in the United \nStates. At bottom, its theory is that a mortgage is a lien on land. (Foreclosure issues are further discussed \nin Section 26.2 \"Priority, Termination of the Mortgage, and Other Methods of Using Real Estate as \nSecurity\".) \nUnder statutes enacted in many states, the mortgagor has one last chance to recover his property, even \nafter foreclosure. This statutory right of redemption extends the period to repay, often by one year. \n \nCreation of the Mortgage \nStatutory Regulation \nThe decision whether to lend money and take a mortgage is affected by several federal and state \nregulations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1083 \nConsumer Credit Statutes Apply \nStatutes dealing with consumer credit transactions (as discussed in Chapter 24 \"Consumer Credit \nTransactions\") have a bearing on the mortgage, including state usury statutes, and the federal Truth in \nLending Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. \n \nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act \nOther federal statutes are directed more specifically at mortgage lending.

Under \nF & D’s interpretation the landlord would not be required to know the scope, cost, etc. of the work, but \nwould only need to give the tenant general permission to perform upgrades or improvements. \n \nClearly, if the landlord/owner or his agent gives consent directly to the materialman, a lien can be \nestablished. Consent can also be given to the tenant, but the consent needs to be specific. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent must know the scope of the project (for instance, as the lease provided in the \ninstant case, the landlord could approve written plans submitted by the tenant). The consent needs to be \nmore than “mere knowledge” that the tenant will perform work on the property. There must be some kind \nof express or implied agreement that the landlord may be held liable for the work or material. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent may delegate the project or work to his tenant, but there must be an express \nor implied agreement about the specific work to be done. A general provision in a lease which allows \ntenant to make repairs or improvements is not enough. \n \nC. Evidence There Was No Consent \n• \nThe record is clear that no contract, express or implied, existed between BG Holding and F & G. \nBG Holding had no knowledge F & G would be performing the work. \n• \nF & G’s supervisor, David Weatherington, and Ray Dutton, the owner of F & D, both testified they \nnever had a conversation with anyone from BG Holding. In fact, until Powder Coaters failed to \npay under the contract, F & D did not know BG Holding was the owner of the building. \n• \nMark Taylor, BG Holding’s agent, testified he never authorized any work by F & D, nor did he see \nany work being performed by them on the site. \n• \nThe lease specifically provided that all work on the property was to be approved in writing by BG \nHolding. \n• \nDavid Weatherington of F & D testified he was looking to Powder Coaters, not BG Holding, for \npayment. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1109 \n• \nPowder Coaters acknowledged it was not authorized to bind BG Holding to pay for the",

The 2005 act—preceded by “massive lobbying largely by banks and credit card companies” [1]—\nwas intended by its promoters to restore personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system. \nThe law’s critics said it was simply a way for the credit card industry to extract more money from \nconsumers before their debts were wiped away. \n \nFigure 27.1 US Bankruptcies, 1980–2009 \n \nBankruptcy Action.com,http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/USbankstats.htm, statistics from \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. \n \nBankruptcy Courts, Judges, and Costs \nEach federal judicial district has a US Bankruptcy Court, whose judges are appointed by US Courts of \nAppeal. Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases. Chapter 5, “Creditors, the \nDebtor, and the Estate,” deals with the debtor’s “estate”—his or her assets. It lays down ground rules for",

Chapter 7 cases may always be converted to \nChapter 13. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nChapter 13 is voluntary only. Anyone—sole proprietorships included—who has a regular income, \nunsecured debts of less than $336,000, and secured debts of less than $1,010,650 is eligible to seek its \nprotection. The debts must be unpaid and owing at the time the debtor applies for relief. If the person has \nmore debt than that, she will have to file Chapter 11. The debtor must attend a credit-counseling class, as \nin Chapter 7. \n \nThe Plan \nPlans are typically extensions or compositions—that is, they extend the time to pay what is owing, or they \nare agreements among creditors each to accept something less than the full amount owed (so that all get \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1153 \nsomething). Under Chapter 13, the stretch-out period is three to five three years. The plan must provide \nfor payments of all future income or a sufficient portion of it to the trustee. Priority creditors are entitled \nto be paid in full, although they may be paid later than required under the original indebtedness. As long \nas the plan is being carried out, the debtor may enjoin any creditors from suing to collect the original debt. \n \nConfirmation \nUnder Section 1325 of the bankruptcy code, the court must approve the plan if it meets certain \nrequirements. These include (1) distribution of property to unsecured creditors whose claims are allowed \nin an amount no less than that which they would have received had the estate been liquidated under \nChapter 7; (2) acceptance by secured creditors, with some exceptions, such as when the debtor surrenders \nthe secured property to the creditor; and (3) proposal of the plan “in good faith.” If the trustee or an \nunsecured creditor objects to confirmation, the plan must meet additional tests. For example, a plan will \nbe approved if all of the debtor’s disposable income (as defined in Section 1325) over the commitment \nperiod (three to five years) will be used to make payments under the plan. \n \nDischarge \nOnce a debtor has made all payments called for in the plan, the court will discharge him from all \nremaining debts except certain long-term debts and obligations to pay alimony, maintenance, and \nsupport. Under former law, Chapter 13 was so broad that it permitted the court to discharge the debtor \nfrom many debts considered nondischargeable under Chapter 7, but 1994 amendments and the 2005 act \nmade Chapter 13 less expansive. Debts dischargeable in Chapter 13, but not in Chapter 7, include debts for \nwillful and malicious injury to property, debts incurred to pay nondischargeable tax obligations, and debts \narising from property settlements in divorce or separation proceedings. (See Section 27.6 \"Cases\", In re \nRyan, for a discussion of what debts are dischargeable under Chapter 13 as compared with Chapter 7.) \n \nAlthough a Chapter 13 debtor generally receives a discharge only after completing all payments required \nby the court-approved (i.e., “confirmed”) repayment plan, there are some limited circumstances under \nwhich the debtor may request the court to grant a “hardship discharge” even though the debtor has failed \nto complete plan payments. Such a discharge is available only to a debtor whose failure to complete plan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1154 \npayments is due to circumstances beyond the debtor’s control. A Chapter 13 discharge stays on the credit \nrecord for up to ten years. \n \nA discharge may be denied if the debtor previously went through a bankruptcy too soon before filing \nChapter 13, failed to act in good faith, or—with some exceptions—failed to complete a personal financial \nmanagement course. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nChapter 11—frequently referred to as “corporate reorganization”—is most often used by businesses whose \nvalue as a going concern is greater than it would be if liquidated, but, with some exceptions, anyone eligible to \nfile Chapter 7 can file Chapter 11. The business owners, or in some cases the trustee or creditors, develop a \nplan to pay the firm’s debts over a three- to five-year period; the plan must be approved by creditors and the \ncourt. Chapter 13—frequently called the wage-earner’s plan—is a similar mechanism by which a person can \ndischarge some debt and have longer to pay debts off than originally scheduled. Under Chapter 13, people can \nget certain relief from creditors that they cannot get in Chapter 7. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular\ninstructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for\nmany followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a “pack of bike\nriders,” familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The\ncompany name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.\nPeloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public\nwith an initial public offering in September 2019. Foley and his friends had the idea that they were a\n“purposeful music company” and needed to touch on all aspects of the workout experience including the\n3\nCatherine Cote. “How and Why Managers Use Financial Statements.” Business Insights.

They were selling an experience, not a bicycle. The\nequipment is expensive—a Peloton bike typically costs over $2,000. Peloton equips its studios with state-of-\nthe-art camera and music systems and pays its instructors top dollar. Along the way, the founders made\nseveral critical financial decisions. They kept control of the firm by using private funding at the start.\nHow can we tell if Peloton has managed its resources well? The company started with $400,000 of funding\nto develop a prototype in 2012. By 2018, firm value increased to $4 billion with yet another round of private\ninvestor funding. As of April 2021, Peloton is a publicly traded company with a stock value of $34 billion. The\nexecutives are sacrificing profits in the short term to generate growth and long-term profitability. The firm\nuses its financial statements to identify sources and uses of funds, to test the effectiveness of advertising,\nand to forecast future profitability. Analysts like the firm, the stock price is up, and by many financial\nmeasures, Peloton has been a great success. Time will tell if the decisions made over the last several years\nwill lead to long-term profitability or if the company has overinvested in marketing only to miss current and\nlong-term profits.\n(Sources: Viktor. “The Peloton Business Model—How Does Peloton Work & Make Money?” Productmint.\nUpdated May 9, 2021. https://productmint.com/the-peloton-business-model-how-does-peloton-make-\nmoney/.

Job descriptions vary\nacross firms, industries, and government organizations. However, the role of financial analyst usually includes\nmarket research, financial forecasting, modeling, cost analysis, and comparative valuations. Financial analysts\ngather data and produce financial reports in conjunction with multiple departments within a business or\norganization. They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they\nwork with accountants to create accurate financial reports.\nAs a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma\nfinancial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes.\nFinancial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative\nand qualitative. Figure 1.6 lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis. Some firms\nrequire an MBA or several years of business experience for their financial analysts.\n1.4 • Careers in Finance\n19\nFigure 1.6 Financial Analyst Tasks\nInternal financial analysts are important for a successful firm or organization because their work can lead to\nmore efficient and cost-effective use of financial and nonfinancial resources. Responsibilities include keeping\ncurrent with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and\noutcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports. Various government agencies also use financial analysts to aid in regulatory oversight and\nenforcement.\nA report from a 2019 BLS survey determines that financial analysts earn an average salary of $81,590, and jobs\nare predicted to grow at a faster-than-average rate of 5% through 2029.5\nBusiness (or Management) Analyst Roles\nThe job description for a business analyst looks much like that for a financial analyst.

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell.

In\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\nSome examples of these might include the following:\n•\nExpanding sales to existing customers\n•\nIncreasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\n•\nDeveloping new products for current and potential customers\n•\nBecoming international by setting up an online ordering service\nCorporate Structure and Governance\n2\n2 • Why It Matters\n39\n•\nImproving customer satisfaction with customer services\nIf managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in\nthe first place. One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that",

While\nsuch organizations may import raw materials and supplies from other nations or end up exporting their\nfinished products to other countries around the world, in the end, these international activities represent only\na very small portion of their overall business activities.\nDomestic companies are typically governed by US accounting and securities laws that have been established\nby the SEC. Further, financial reporting for these domestic organizations is to be completed using Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\nInternational firms, while based in the United States, will typically maintain significant levels of international\ninvestment and conduct operations that may be quite diverse, both geographically and culturally. For such\ninternational firms, parent company accounting will usually adhere to GAAP standards. Conversely, non-US\nsubsidiaries of such international firms may be regulated by laws dictated by their host countries. These will\noften differ significantly from those in the United States.\nIn recent years, accounting regulations in countries outside the United States have come under the jurisdiction\nof International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It should be noted that guidelines and regulations under\nIFRS and those under GAAP can differ significantly. As a result of these regulatory differences, any specific\ndivergences in accounting or governance practices between foreign subsidiaries and a US parent company\nshould be clearly stated and disclosed in the parent company’s financial reports.\nGlobal firms have substantial operations and investments in different countries (global markets), and they\nmay have no single center or basis of operational activity.

To learn more about these changes in demand, watch the MRU video on demand\ncurve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video).\nSupply\nSupply is the quantity of a good or service that firms are willing to sell at various prices, during a given time\nperiod, ceteris paribus. Table 3.3 is a fictional example of a supply schedule for pizzas. In some cases, higher\nprices encourage producers to provide more of their product for sale.

Because a higher price\nencourages suppliers to sell more pizzas, the supply curve will be upward sloping.\nFigure 3.4 Supply Curve for Pizzas\nThe supply curve isolates the relationship between the price of pizzas and the quantity of pizzas supplied. All\nother relevant economic factors are assumed to remain unchanged when the curve is drawn. If a factor such\nas the cost of cheese or the salaries paid to workers changes, then the supply curve will move. A shift to the\nright indicates that a greater quantity of pizzas will be provided by firms at a particular price; this would\nindicate an increase in supply. A decrease in supply would be represented by a shift in the supply curve to the\nleft.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSupply Curve Shifts\nThe ceteris paribus assumption is made when drawing a supply curve, just as it is when drawing a demand\ncurve. If a relevant economic variable other than the price of the good for which the supply curve is drawn\nchanges, the supply curve will shift. For more information about how changes in these variables will move\nthe supply curve, watch the MRU video on supply curve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video-on-\nsupply).\nEquilibrium Price\nDemand represents buyers, and supply represents sellers. In the market, these two groups interact to\ndetermine the price of a good and the quantity of the good that is sold. Because both the demand curve and\nthe supply curve are graphed with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, these two\ncurves can be placed in the same graph, as is shown in Figure 3.5.\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n71\nFigure 3.5 Graph of Demand and Supply Showing Equilibrium Price and Quantity\nThe point at which the supply and demand curves intersect is known as the equilibrium. At the equilibrium\nprice, the quantity demanded will equal exactly the quantity supplied. There is no shortage or surplus of the\nproduct. In the example shown in Figure 3.5, when the price is $15, consumers want to purchase 30 pizzas and\nsellers want to make 30 pizzas available for purchase. The market is in balance.\nA price higher than the equilibrium price will not be sustainable in a competitive marketplace. If the price of a\npizza were $20, suppliers would make 40 pizzas available, but the quantity of pizzas demanded would be only\n20 pizzas. This would be a surplus, or excess quantity supplied, of pizzas. Restaurant owners who see that they\nhave 40 pizzas to sell but can only sell 20 of those pizzas will lower their prices to encourage more customers\nto purchase pizzas. At the same time, the restaurant owners will cut back on their pizza production. This\nprocess will drive the pizza price down from $20 toward the equilibrium price.\nThe opposite would occur if the price of a pizza were only $5. Customers may want to purchase 50 pizzas, but\nrestaurants would only want to sell 10 pizzas at the low price. Quantity demanded would exceed quantity\nsupplied. At a price below the equilibrium price, a shortage would occur. Shortages drive prices up toward the\nequilibrium price.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Equilibrium Price\nA competitive market will drive prices to equilibrium.

A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\nborrowers.

At lower\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves.

If you want to borrow money to purchase a\ncar and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.\nOr suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod.

While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\n3.4 • Interest Rates\n87\ncredit risk. Lenders want to be rewarded for taking on this risk, so they charge a premium to borrowers who\nare higher risk.\nCompanies are more likely to go bankrupt and not be able to pay their bills on time than is the US\ngovernment. So, corporations have to pay a higher interest rate than the US government. If a lender can earn\n1% lending to the US government, the lender will only be willing to lend to the riskier corporation if they can\nearn more than 1%. In Figure 3.18, the interest rates paid by very creditworthy companies is shown. The prime\nrate is the interest rate that banks charge their very best customers—large companies that are financially very\nstrong and have a very low risk of default.\nIt is generally riskier for a lender to make a loan to an individual than to a corporation. Individuals are more\nlikely to become ill, lose their job, or experience some other financial setback that makes it difficult for them to\nrepay their loans. In Figure 3.18, the interest rate on credit card loans is much higher than the interest rate\ncharged to corporate borrowers. That is because credit card loans are a high risk to the lender. Unlike other\nloans made to an individual, such as a car loan, the credit card company has no collateral if a consumer cannot\npay back the loan. With car loans, if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed money, the lender can repossess\nthe automobile and sell it to recoup some of the money it is owed. If you use a credit card to buy groceries and\ndo not repay the loan, the credit card company cannot repossess the groceries that you purchased. Therefore,\ncredit card loans have notoriously high interest rates to compensate the lender for the high risk.\nFigure 3.18 Interest Rate on US Treasury Bills and Credit Cards11 This graph shows the rates posted by a majority of top 25 (by\nassets in domestic offices) insured US-chartered commercial banks.

Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\nestimated useful life.\nRecording the Initial Asset\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years.

It is common and\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\nand increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined\nby the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and\noverstate net income by $1.7 billion.4\nComponents Used in Calculating Depreciation\nThe expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful\nlife is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we\nwould allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\n$10,000.",

The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing. For\n122\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexample, a customer may buy a good on account. Revenues would be recorded, but cash would not yet be\nreceived. The same is true on the expenses side. An expense can be incurred, such as an electric bill, but cash\nmay not have been paid out yet. Thus, an expense is recorded and recognized on the income statement, but\ncash has not yet been given up. The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net\nincome (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.\n4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\n123\nSummary\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\naccounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash\nbasis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.\n4.2 Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\nDouble-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts\nimpacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual-basis accounting\nan accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\nwhen paid\ncapitalize\nthe process in which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet and its allocated costs are\nexpensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life\ncash-basis accounting\na method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash\ncredit\na record of financial information on the right side of an account\ndebit\na record of financial information on the left side of each account\n124\n4 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndepreciation\nthe process of allocating the costs of a tangible asset over the asset’s economic life\ndouble-entry accounting\nan accounting method that requires the sum of the debits to equal the sum of the\ncredits for each transaction\nexpense\na cost associated with providing goods or services\nexpense recognition\n(also, matching principle) matches expenses with associated revenues in the period in\nwhich the revenues were generated\ngains\nincreases in organizational value from activities that are “incidental or peripheral” to the primary\npurpose of the business\nincome statement",

They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n143\nconsumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect. FASB (Financial Accounting\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\nfixed assets). Finally, financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business (loans, interest).\nAs mentioned, operating activities are those that are used or generated by the day-to-day operations of the\nfirm. The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these\nare liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an\nincrease to the statement.\nTallying all these adjustments to net income shows Clear Lake’s net cash flows provided by operating activities\nof $53,600 (see Figure 5.16).\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n145\nFigure 5.16 Operating Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\nInvesting Activities\nAs mentioned, investing activities include investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself\n(items like machinery, land, or other fixed assets). These are items that are capitalized (placed on the balance\nsheet and depreciated over time) and thus did not reduce net income. They did, however, cause an impact to\ncash flow (see Figure 5.17).\nDuring the current year, Clear Lake purchased an additional $5,000 in short-term investments (see the\ncomparative balances sheets; the balance in that account increased by $5,000 since the prior year). They also\npurchased additional plant assets in the amount of $13,600. This amount can be figured by comparing the\ndifference in the current and prior plant assets accounts and including the impact of current year depreciation\n($50,000 current year balance less $40,000 prior year balance and $3,600 of depreciation = $13,600 of new\nassets purchased).\nFigure 5.17 Investing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\nFinancing Activities\nRecall that financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business.

Most financial statements are\nprepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to\narrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other\nnonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.\n5.2 The Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly\ndepict and support the accounting equation:\nA classified balance\nsheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nThe financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is\nneeded in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of\nthe balance sheet.\n5.4 The Statement of Owner’s Equity\nThe statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,\nadditional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, for example. Beginning balances are provided, and all key\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\nneeds for growth.\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.",

The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the\naccounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make\ninventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of\nfishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other\ncurrent projects. The lower turnover rate may signal a high level of bad debt accounts. The determination of a\nhigh or low turnover rate really depends on the standards of the company’s industry. It’s key to note the\ntradeoff in adjusting credit terms. Loose credit terms may attract more customers but may also increase bad\ndebt expense. Tighter credit terms may attract fewer customers but may also reduce bad debt expense.\nThe formula for accounts receivable turnover is\nNet credit sales are sales made on credit only; cash sales are not included because they do not produce\nreceivables. However, many companies do not report credit sales separately from cash sales, so “net sales”\nmay be substituted for “net credit sales” in this case. Beginning and ending accounts receivable refer to the\n168\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbeginning and ending balances in accounts receivable for the period. The beginning accounts receivable\nbalance is the same figure as the ending accounts receivable balance from the prior period.\nWhen computing the accounts receivable turnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, let’s assume net credit sales\nmake up $100,000 of the $120,000 of the net sales found on the income statement in the current year.\nTo gain a better understanding of its ratio performance, Clear Lake Sporting Goods can compare its turnover\nto industry averages, key competitors, and its own historical ratios. Given this outcome, the managers may\nwant to consider stricter credit lending practices to make sure credit customers are of a higher quality. They\nmay also need to be more aggressive with collecting any outstanding accounts.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nAccounts Receivable Turnover",

In our spreadsheet example, as the\nFV formula is being typed into cell E2, a banner showing the arguments necessary to complete the function\nappears directly below, hovering over cell E3.\nFigure 7.3 Using the FV Function in Excel\nCells E1 and E2 show how the FV function appears in the spreadsheet as it is typed in with the required\narguments. Cell E4 shows the calculated answer for cell E1 after hitting the enter key. Once the enter key is\npressed, the hint banner hovering over cell E3 will disappear. The second example of the FV function in our\nexample spreadsheet is in cell E6. Here, the actual numerical values are used in the FV function equation\nrather than cell references. The method in cell E8 is referred to as hard coding. In general, it is preferable to\nuse the cell reference method, as this allows for copying formulas and provides the user with increased\nflexibility in accounting for changes to input data. This ability to accept cell references in formulas is one of the\ngreatest strengths of Excel as a spreadsheet tool.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/docs.google_uc_export) containing key Chapter\n7 Excel exhibits.\nDetermining Future Value When Other Variables Are Known.

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\nhigher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\nventures?\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.",

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments\navailable to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,\nBonds and Bond Valuation\n10\n10 • Why It Matters\n283\nadding a degree of safety and diversity to their investment mix.\n10.1\nCharacteristics of Bonds\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nList and define the basic characteristics of bonds.\n•\nList and describe the various types of bonds available.\n•\nExplain how a bond price is inversely related to its return (yield).\nBonds as Investments\nOne way to look at bond investments is to consider the fact that any investor who purchases a bond is\nessentially buying a future cash flow stream that the bond issuer (or borrower) promises to make as per\nagreement.\nBecause bonds provide a set amount of cash inflow to their owners, they are often called fixed-income\nsecurities. Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•\nPar value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284",

Additionally, Enron’s unscrupulous business practices included\nrevenue misstatements and other questionable accounting practices to indicate favorable financial\nperformance. On top of this, some of Enron’s speculative business ventures proved to be disastrous,\nresulting in substantial financial losses.\nInitial allegations against Enron also focused on the role of their public accountants, Arthur Andersen.\nAndersen was one of the Big Five accounting firms in the United States at that time and had served as\nEnron’s auditing firm for over 16 years. According to court documents, Enron and Arthur Andersen had\nimproperly categorized hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions as increases to the company’s\nshareholder equity. It was also later discovered that Andersen failed to follow generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) when considering Enron’s dealings with related partnerships. As a result,\nEnron was able to conceal some of its losses from the investing public. After investigation by the United\nStates Justice Department, the firm was indicted on obstruction of justice charges in March 2002. The\ncombination of all of these irregularities and issues resulted in the December 2, 2001, bankruptcy of the\ncorporation.7 It was later determined that the majority of these unethical issues had been perpetuated with\nthe indirect knowledge or even, in some cases, by the direct actions of the board of directors or senior\noperational management of the company.\nSpecifics and Enron’s Bond Ratings\nOn October 27, 2001, the company began buying back all its commercial paper, valued at around $3.3\nbillion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron’s supply of cash. On November 8, Enron announced\nthat restatements to its financial statements for the years 1997–2000 were necessary to correct several\naccounting violations. However, by November 28, 2001, credit rating agencies had reduced Enron’s bond\nrating to junk status.8\nOther Examples of Significant Bond Ratings Downgrades\nSome companies that have recently experienced downgrades (or potential downgrades) to their credit and\nbond ratings include Delta Airlines, Ford, Occidental Petroleum, Carnival Cruises, and T-Mobil.

The coupon rate of a\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor\npurchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive\n20 coupon payments equal to\nor\nfor a total of $1,000.\nDepending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation\nresulting in significant realized return for the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could",

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call\na feature of certain bonds or other fixed-income instruments that allows the issuer to repurchase\nand retire these instruments before maturity\nbond price\nthe present, discounted value of the future cash stream generated by a bond; the sum of the\npresent values of all likely coupon payments and the present value of the par value at maturity\nbond ratings\ngrades assigned to bonds by rating services that indicate their overall credit quality\nBusiness Cycle Dating Committee\na subdivision of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the\nUS government agency that maintains a chronology of US business cycles\ncall risk",

You can then compare the calculated\nprice to the actual market price in order to determine whether purchasing the stock at market will meet your\nrequirements.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDividend Discount Model\nWatch this short video on the dividend discount model (https://openstax.org/r/\nshort_video_on_the_dividend) and how it is used it in stock valuation and analysis.\nThe Gordon growth model equation is presented and then applied to a sample problem to demonstrate\nhow the DDM yields an estimated share price for the stock of any company.\nNow that we have been introduced to the basic idea behind the dividend discount model, we can move on to\ncover other forms of DDM.\nZero Growth Dividend Discount Model\nThe zero growth DDM assumes that all future dividends of a stock will be fixed at essentially the same dollar\nvalue forever, or at least for as long as an individual investor holds the shares of stock. In such a case, the\nstock’s intrinsic value is determined by dividing the annual dividend amount by the required rate of return:\nWhen examined closely, it can be seen that this is the exact same formula that is used to calculate the present\nvalue of a perpetuity, which is\nFor the purpose of using this formula in stock valuation, we can express this as\nwhere PV is equal to the price or value of the stock, D represents the dividend payment, and r represents the\nrequired rate of return.\nThis makes perfect sense because a stock that pays the exact same dividend amount forever is no different\nfrom a perpetuity—a continuous, never-ending annuity—and for this reason, the same formula can be used\nto price preferred stock. The only factor that might alter the value of a stock based on the zero-growth model\nwould be a change in the required rate of return due to fluctuations in perceived risk levels.\n326\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nExample:\nWhat is the intrinsic value of a stock that pays $2.00 in dividends every year if the required rate of return on\nsimilar investments in the market is 6%?\nSolution:\nWe can apply the zero growth DDM formula to get\nWhile this model is relatively easy to understand and to calculate, it has one significant flaw: it is highly unlikely\nthat a firm’s stock would pay the exact same dollar amount in dividends forever, or even for an extended\nperiod of time. As companies change and grow, dividend policies will change, and it naturally follows that the\npayout of dividends will also change. This is why it is important to become familiar with other DDMs that may\nbe more practical in their use.\nConstant Growth Dividend Discount Model\nAs indicated by its name, the constant growth DDM assumes that a stock’s dividend payments will grow at a\nfixed annual percentage that will remain the same throughout the period of time they are held by an investor.\nWhile the constant growth DDM may be more realistic than the zero growth DDM in allowing for dividend\ngrowth, it assumes that dividends grow by the same specific percentage each year. This is also an unrealistic\nassumption that can present problems when attempting to evaluate companies such as Amazon, Facebook,\nGoogle, or other organizations that do not pay dividends. Constant growth models are most often used to\nvalue mature companies whose dividend payments have steadily increased over a significant period of time.",

It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant\ncash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of\nperpetuity.\nIt is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another\nform of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred\nstock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.\nDetermining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock\nWe can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the\nfollowing example. Oh-Well Heath Services Inc. has issued preferred stock that has a par value of $1,000 and\npays an annual dividend rate of 5%. If the market considers the risk of Oh-Well to warrant a 10% discount rate,\nwhat would be a fair market price for Oh-Well preferred stock?\nFirst, we find the dividend value of Oh-Well:\nWe then use the constant dividend model with infinite horizon because we have g equal to zero and n equal to\ninfinity:\nWe can also rearrange the formula to determine the required return on this stock, given its annual dividend\nand current price.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating the Return on Preferred Stock\nData Forge Inc. has just issued preferred stock (cumulative) with a par value of $100.00 and an annual\ndividend rate of 7%. The preferred stock is currently selling for $35.00 per share. What is the yield or return\non this preferred stock?\nSolution:\nThe first step is to determine the annual dividend by multiplying the dividend rate by the par value:\nNow, using this $7.00 annual dividend, the $35.00 current price, and the equation above, we calculate the\nrate of return as follows:\n344\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nWe have introduced the concept of return here, which should be thought of as both the anticipated return for\nthe preferred stockholder and the company’s cost of borrowing money for this particular type of capital.\nDifferences between Preferred and Common Stock\nAs we have discussed, preferred stock has important differences from common stock that apply to issuing\nfirms and to investors. Some of the most important of these differences are listed in Table 11.7.\nFeature\nCommon Stock\nPreferred Stock\nDividends\nPaid only after preferred stockholders are\npaid\nHighest priority, paid first\nDividends\nVariable and may increase or decrease\nPredetermined rates, so constant dividend amounts\nGrowth\nHigh potential but tied to company\nperformance\nLiquidation Paid out last, after all creditors and\npreferred stockholders are paid\nGiven preference in terms of payments, similar to\nbonds\nVoting\nRights\nYes\nNo\nArrears\nNo accrual of missed dividends\nIf cumulative, unpaid dividends become liability that\nmust be paid out eventually\nCertainty\nDividends potentially not paid if company\nearns no profits\nDividends paid even when company experiences\nfinancial losses\nTable 11.7 Differences between Common Stock and Preferred Stock\n11.5\nEfficient Markets\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nUnderstand what is meant by the term efficient markets.\n•\nUnderstand the term operational efficiency when referring to markets.\n•\nUnderstand the term informational efficiency when referring to markets.\n•\nDistinguish between strong, semi-strong, and weak levels of efficiency in markets.\nEfficient Markets\nFor the public, the real concern when buying and selling of stock through the stock market is the question,\n“How do I know if I’m getting the best available price for my transaction?” We might ask an even broader\nquestion: Do these markets provide the best prices and the quickest possible execution of a trade? In other\nwords, we want to know whether markets are efficient. By efficient markets, we mean markets in which costs\nare minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. To answer our questions, we will look at two forms of\nefficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency.\nOperational Efficiency\nOperational efficiency concerns the speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available\nprice. Through the years, the competitive nature of the market has promoted operational efficiency.\nIn the past, the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) used a designated-order turnaround computer system\nknown as SuperDOT to manage orders.

T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\n354\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-\nexempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid\nsecurities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable.

For corporations, shares of stock\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the\ncash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.\nCorporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise\ncapital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners. There are generally\ntwo types of stock, preferred and common. Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and bonds.\nPreferred stock has a higher claim to cash flows than common stockholders have (thus the term preferred),\nbut it is lower than that of bondholders. In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of\nthe three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.\nCommon stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a\nclaim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have\nvoting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.\nOne popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or\nmarket cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The largest company by sales\nvolume in 2020 was Walmart.7\nGeographical Location of Exchanges\nOwnership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in an over-\nthe-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly\nadapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a\nbroker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors\nare always able to buy or sell their stocks.

In fact, T-bonds often\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,\nbond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments\nin 1982. That year provided the highest annual return in the 20-year period, with an annual return of 32.81%.\nThe lowest annual return was in 1999, as the Federal Reserve began to raise rates to temper an overheating\nstock market caused by dot-com speculation gaining momentum. When the Fed raised interest rates, the\nprices on existing bonds fell, and investors realized a -8.25% return on their bond portfolios. Thus, the range in\nreturns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in\nthis particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust\n10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.\n366\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.8 Treasury Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nInflation slowed from 2000 to 2020, and the average annual rate of return on T-bonds fell accordingly (see\nFigure 12.9). With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being\nlower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the\nprevious century. The range of returns was also smaller than the previous two decades, with the highest\nannual return topping out at 20.10% in 2008 and the lower end dipping down to -11.12% in 2009 as the Fed\nmade a significant effort to reduce interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy following the Great\nRecession.\nCorporate Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs\nThe performance of Baa bonds is very similar to T-Bonds over the four decades spanning 1980 to 2020 (see\nFigure 12.10). These bonds are not default-risk free and require a risk premium for investors. The average\nannual return of 12.07% from 1980 to 1999 topped T-bonds by 1.86%. The margin was greater in the period\nfrom 2000 to 2020 (see Figure 12.11), with Baa bonds (mid-tier corporate bonds) realizing an average annual\npremium of 2.30% over the default-risk free T-bonds.\nThese premiums translate to a substantial increase in investment performance. For example, had an investor\nplaced $100 into a T-bond portfolio in 1980, the value of the investment would have been $1,931 by year-end\n2020. This would have easily outpaced the rate of inflation but significantly lagged the ending value of $4,506\non a similar Baa bond portfolio investment (see Figure 12.12).\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\n367\nFigure 12.9 Treasury Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.10 Baa Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.11 Baa Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\n368\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.12 Baa Bonds versus T-Bonds Performance, 1980–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nProfile of Bill Gross\nBill Gross may be the most successful fixed-income investor ever, but he is also a prime example of the\napplication of the efficient market theory.

In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If",

It is available as a free program and\nprovides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical programming. R is\nincreasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical tool as it is an open-source language and additional\nfeatures are constantly being added by the user community. The tool can be used on many different\ncomputing platforms and can be downloaded at the R Project website (https://openstax.org/r/the-R-project-\nwebsite).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUsing the R Statistical Tool\nThere are many resources for learning and using the R statistical tool, including the following:\nHow to install R on different computer operating systems (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-install)\nIntroduction to using R (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-using-R)\nHow to import and export data using R (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-import-and-export)\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) on using R (https://openstax.org/r/frequently-asked-questions)\nOnce you have installed and started R on your computer, at the bottom of the R console, you should see the\nsymbol >, which indicates that R is ready to accept commands.\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or 'help.start()' for an HTML\nbrowser interface to help. Type 'q()' to quit R.\n>\nR is a command-driven language, meaning that the user enters commands at the prompt, which R then\nexecutes one at a time. R can also execute a program containing multiple commands. There are ways to add a\ngraphic user interface (GUI) to R. An example of a GUI tool for R is RStudio (https://openstax.org/r/RStudio).\nThe R command line can be used to perform any numeric calculation, similar to a handheld calculator. For\n406\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexample, to evaluate the expression\nenter the following expression at the command line prompt\nand hit return:\n> 10+3*7\n[1] 31\nMost calculations in R are handled via functions. For statistical analysis, there are many preestablished\nfunctions in R to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and so on. Variables can be named and\nassigned values using the assignment operator <-. For example, the following R commands assign the value of\n20 to the variable named x and assign the value of 30 to the variable named y:\n> x <- 20\n> y <- 30\nThese variable names can be used in any calculation, such as multiplying x by y to produce the result 600:\n> x*y\n[1] 600\nThe typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector. The following R command will generate a vector called salaries that contains the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nThis vector salaries can then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as\nshown:\n> mean(salaries)\n[1] 64250\n> median(salaries)\n[1] 62500\n> min(salaries)\n[1] 40000\n> max(salaries)\n[1] 92000\n13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool\n407\nAnother option for generating a vector in R is to use the seq function, which will automatically generate a\nsequence of numbers. For example, we can generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, incremented by 0.5,\nand call this vector example1, as follows:\n> example1 <- seq(1, 5, by=0.5)\nIf we then type the name of the vector and hit enter, R will provide a listing of numeric values for that vector\nname.\n> salaries\n[1] 40000 50000 75000 92000\n> example1\n[1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\nOften, we are interested in generating a quick statistical summary of a data set in the form of its mean,",

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval. The second case, where we\nare asking for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variable y of a single experiment using a value of x,\nis called the prediction interval.\nThe prediction interval for an individual y for\ncan be calculated as\nwhere se is the standard deviation of the error term, sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable, and\nis\nthe critical value of the t-distribution at the\nconfidence level.\nTabulated values of the t-distribution are available in online references such as the Engineering Statistics\nHandbook (https://openstax.org/r/engineering_handbook). The mathematical computations for prediction\nintervals are complex, and usually the calculations are performed using software. The formula above can be\nimplemented in Excel to create a 95% prediction interval for the forecast for monthly revenue when\nis spent on monthly advertising. Figure 14.10 shows the detailed calculations in Excel to arrive at a\n95% prediction interval of (13,270.95, 15,370.09) for the monthly revenue. (The commands refer to the Excel\ndata table shown in Figure 14.9.)\n436\n14 • Regression Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 14.10 Calculations for 95% Prediction Interval for Monthly Revenue\nThis prediction interval can be interpreted as follows: there is 95% confidence that when the amount spent on\nmonthly advertising is $80,000, the corresponding monthly revenue will be between $13,270.95 and\n$15,370.09.\nVarious computer regression software packages provide programs within the regression functions to provide\nanswers to inquiries of estimated predicted values of y given various values chosen for the x-variable(s). For\nexample, the statistical program R provides these prediction intervals directly. It is important to know just\nwhich interval is being tested in the computer package because the difference in the size of the standard\ndeviations will change the size of the interval estimated. This is shown in Figure 14.11.\nFigure 14.11 Prediction and Confidence Intervals for Regression Equation at 95% Confidence Level\nFigure 14.11 shows visually the difference the standard deviation makes in the size of the estimated intervals.\nThe confidence interval, measuring the expected value of the dependent variable, is smaller than the\nprediction interval for the same level of confidence. The expected value method assumes that the experiment\nis conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method. The logic here is similar, although\nnot identical, to that discussed when developing the relationship between the sample size and the confidence\ninterval using the central limit theorem. There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation.

In fact, the standard deviation of returns for the US Treasury bills is 3.0%. Unlike the returns for\nstocks, the return on US Treasury bills has never been negative.

Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will\nonly be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to\ntake the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make\ninvesting in US Treasury securities.\nFrom 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher\nthan the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.7 Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,\nhowever, have also been much more volatile. In fact, there were 25 years in which the return for the S&P 500\nindex was negative.\nYou may not be willing to take the risk of losing some of the money your grandparents gave you because you\nhave been setting it aside for law school. If that’s the case, you will want to invest in US Treasury securities.\nYou may have money that you are saving for other long-term goals, such as retirement, with which you are\nwilling to take some risk. The extra return that you will earn for taking on risk is known as the risk premium.\nThe risk premium can be thought of as your reward for being willing to bear risk.\nThe risk premium is calculated as the difference between the return you receive for taking on risk and what\nyou would have returned if you did not take on risk. Using the average return of the S&P 500 (to measure what\ninvestors who bear the risk earn) and the US Treasury bill rate (to measure what investors who do not bear\nrisk earn), the risk premium is calculated as\nBeta\nThe risk premium represents how much an investor who takes on the market portfolio is rewarded for risk.\nInvestors who purchase one stock—DAL, for example—experience volatility, which is measured by the\nstandard deviation of that stock’s returns.

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3. Monthly returns for DAL and for the S&P 500\nare plotted in the diagram. Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to a month from 2018 to 2020; for\nexample, the dot that lies furthest in the upper right-hand corner represents November 2020. The return for\nthe S&P 500 was 10.88% that month; this return is plotted along the horizontal axis. The return for DAL during\nNovember 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.\nYou can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return\nfor DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL\nis also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta. Beta\nmeasures the amount of systematic risk that DAL has.\nFigure 15.3 Calculation of Beta for DAL (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\n15.3 • The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n463\nCAPM Equation\nBecause DAL’s beta of 1.39 is greater than 1, DAL is riskier than the average stock in the market. Finance\ntheory suggests that investors who purchase DAL will expect a higher rate of return to compensate them for\nthis risk. DAL has 139% of the average stock’s systematic risk; therefore, investors in the stock should receive\n139% of the market risk premium.\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) equation is\nwhere Re is the expected return of the asset, Rf is the risk-free rate of return, and Rm is the expected return of\nthe market. Given the average S&P 500 return of 11.64% and the average US Treasury bill return of 3.36%, the\nexpected return of DAL would be calculated as\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCalculating Beta\nMany providers of stock data and investment information will list a company’s beta. Two internet sources\nthat can be used to find a company’s beta are Yahoo! Finance (https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo) and\nMarketWatch (https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact\nsame value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021, Yahoo! Finance reported that the\nbeta for DAL was 1.46,8 while MarketWatch reported it as 1.29.9 Both of these numbers are slightly\ndifferent from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.\nThere are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in\nthe beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta in Figure 15.3. Time frames\nranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different\nsources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are\nused in Figure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data. Finally, the S&P 500 is used to measure the market\nreturn in Figure 15.3; the S&P 500 is one of the most common measures of overall market returns, but\nalternatives exist and are used by some analysts\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCAPM\nWatch this video (https://openstax.org/r/pricing-model-capm) for further information about the CAPM.\n8\n“Delta Air Lines, Inc.

The average monthly portfolio return is 2.69%.\nBecause this is an equally weighted portfolio, with each of the four stocks impacting the portfolio return in the\nsame way, the average monthly portfolio return of 2.69% is the same as the sum of the average monthly\nreturns of the four stocks divided by four, or\n.\nThe standard deviation of the monthly portfolio returns is calculated in cell F40. This four-stock portfolio has a\nstandard deviation of 7.10%. Unlike the average return, this standard deviation is not equal to the average of\nthe standard deviations of returns of the four stocks. In fact, the standard deviation for the portfolio is less\nthan the standard deviation for any one of the four stocks. Remember that this occurs because the stock\nreturns are not perfectly positively correlated. The high return of one of the stocks in one month is dampened\nby a lower return in another stock during the same month. Likewise, a negative return in one stock during a\nmonth might be offset by a positive return in one of the other three stocks during the same month. This is the\nrisk reduction benefit of holding a portfolio of stocks.\nCalculating Beta\nThe standard deviation of a stock’s returns indicates the stock’s volatility. Remember that the volatility is\ncaused by both firm-specific and systematic risk. Investors will not be rewarded for firm-specific risk because\n15.5 • Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\n469\nthey can diversify away from it. Investors are, however, rewarded for systematic risk. To determine how much\nof a firm’s risk is due to systematic risk, you can use Excel to calculate the stock’s beta.\nTo calculate a stock’s beta, you need the monthly return for the market in addition to the monthly market\nreturn for the stock. In column B in Figure 15.6, the monthly return for SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust, is\nrecorded. SPY is an ETF that was created to mimic the performance of the S&P 500 index by State Street Global\nAdvisors and is often used as a proxy for the overall market performance. The monthly returns for AMZN are\nvisible in column C. It is important that these returns be lined up so that the returns for a particular month for\nboth securities appear in the same row number. Also, you want to place the returns for SPY in the column to\nthe left of the returns for AMZN so that when you create your graph, SPY will automatically appear on the\nhorizontal axis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nState Street Global Advisors\nYou can learn more about State Street Global Advisors and its creation of the first ETF by visiting the\ncompany’s history page at its website (ssga.com) (https://openstax.org/r/ssga_institutional_our-history).\nYou will use a scatter plot to create a graph.

First, the NPV\nmethod uses the time value of money concept. All of the cash flows are discounted back to their present value\nto be compared. Second, the NPV method provides a clear decision criterion. Projects with a positive NPV\nshould be accepted, and projects with a negative NPV should be rejected.

The denominator is the present value of\n488\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe cost of doing the project. The formula for calculating PI is\nFor the embroidery machine project that Sam’s Sporting Goods is considering, the PI would be calculated as\nThe numerator of the PI formula is the benefit of the project, and the denominator is the cost of the project.\nThus, the PI is the benefit relative to the cost. When NPV is greater than zero, PI will be greater than 1. When\nNPV is less than zero, PI will be less than 1. Therefore, the decision criterion using the PI method is to accept a\nproject if the PI is greater than 1 and reject a project if the PI is less than 1.\nNote that the NPV method and the PI method of project evaluation will always provide the same answer to the\naccept-or-reject question. The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from\nbest to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.\nDiscounted Payback Period\nThe payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the\nfact that it ignores the time value of money. The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\ndetermine the payback period.\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback\nperiod does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00)\n2,000.00\n4,000.00\n5,000.00\n5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\nDiscounted Cash Flow ($)\n(16,000)\n1,834.86\n3,366.72\n3,860.92\n3,542.13 3,249.66 2,981.34\nCumulative Discounted\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00) (14,165.14) (10,798.42) (6,937.50) (3,395.37) (145.72) 2,835.62\nTable 16.9\nWhen the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.\nThe discounted payback period would be\nyears. This adjusted calculation addresses the\npayback period method’s flaw of not considering the time value of money, but managers are still confronted\nwith the other disadvantages. No objective criterion for acceptance or rejection exists because of the lack of a\ntheoretical underpinning for what is an acceptable payback period length. The discounted payback period\nignores any cash flows after breakeven occurs; this is a serious drawback, especially when comparing mutually\nexclusive projects.\nModified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)\nFinancial analysts have developed an alternative evaluation technique that is similar to the IRR but modified in\nan attempt to address some of the weakness of the IRR method. This modified internal rate of return\n(MIRR) is calculated using the following steps:\n1.\nFind the present value of all of the cash outflows using the firm’s cost of attracting capital as the discount\n16.4 • Alternative Methods\n489\nrate.\n2.\nFind the future value of all cash inflows using the firm’s cost of attracting capital as the discount rate.

The NPV formula is\nshown in cell J7 in Figure 16.6 below. However, it is important to pay attention to how Excel defines NPV. The\nExcel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period 1 through\nthe end of the project using the designated discount rate, but it fails to include the initial investment at time\n496\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nperiod zero at the beginning of the project. The NPV function in cell J6 will return $56,947 for this project. You\nmust subtract the initial cash outflow of $30,000 that occurs at time 0 to get the NPV of $26,947 for the project.\nWhen entering the Excel-programmed NPV function, you must remember to include references only to the\ncells that contain cash flows from year 1 to the end of the project. Then, subtract the initial investment of year\n0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV—the present values of the cash inflows minus\nthe present value of the cash outflow. Note: Because of the nonstandard use of the term NPV by Excel, many\nusers prefer to use the method described above rather than this predefined function.\nFigure 16.6 NPV Formula ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nCalculating IRR Using Excel\nExcel also provide a function for calculating IRR. This function is shown in Figure 16.7, cell J8. The IRR function\nproperly uses all the project’s cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at time 0, in its calculation, unlike\nthe NPV function. This function will correctly return the IRR of 27.7% for the project.

It is the time it takes the company to recoup its\ninitial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\nNPV is negative.\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\n16.4 Alternative Methods\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered. MIRR provides a variation on IRR in which all cash\nflows are compounded using the cost of capital, resolving the reinvestment rate assumption problem of the\nIRR method; unlike IRR, which may have multiple mathematical solutions, MIRR will result in one solution. The\nprofitability index is calculated as the NPV of the project divided by the initial cost of the project.\n16.5 Choosing between Projects\nFirms may need to choose among a variety of good projects. The projects may have different lives or be\ndifferently sized projects that require different amounts of resources. By choosing projects with the highest\nprofitability index, companies can take on the projects that will lead to the greatest increase in value for the\ncompany.\n16.6 Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions\nExcel spreadsheets provide a way to easily calculate the NPV and IRR of a project.

Finance; MarketWatch)\n514\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example,\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an\nestimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much\nhigher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and\nRubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with\nan estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable\nassumptions.\nWhat is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A\nfinancial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different\nchoices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.",

It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth\nIt’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow. While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months. Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential",
