            "chunk": "there are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory. Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought.

When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes,",

For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwould override previous federal or state statutes. \n \nOne example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-\ndolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico. The Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments \nin 1988 spelled out certain protections for dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n25 \nbegan refusing to allow the importation of tuna that were caught using “dolphin-unfriendly” methods \n(such as purse seining). This was challenged at a GATT dispute panel in Switzerland, and the United \nStates lost. The discussion continued at the WTO under its dispute resolution process. In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective. That is, the United States may “unbind” itself \nwhenever it chooses. But for practical purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the \nnation. The argument goes something like this: if free trade in general helps the United States, then it \nmakes some sense to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite some temporary setbacks, \nthe WTO decision process will (it is hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run. This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process. Had Ross Perot \nbeen elected in 1992, for example, NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during his term \nof office. \n \nCauses of Action, Precedent, and Stare Decisis \nNo matter how wrong someone’s actions may seem to you, the only wrongs you can right in a court are \nthose that can be tied to one or more causes of action. Positive law is full of cases, treaties, statutes, \nregulations, and constitutional provisions that can be made into a cause of action. If you have an \nagreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-six trombones from you and he fails to pay for \nthem after you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will only act favorably on your \ncomplaint if you can show that his behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your state’s \ncontract law. This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n26 \nthat the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use \nto him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him. \n \nAn old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis \nnon curat lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action. If you are \nstood up for a Saturday night date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover anything in a \ncourt of law in the United States, as there is no cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can \nuse in your complaint. If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases. How closely your case “fits”",

The FLSA is administered and enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor. It applies to employees in every industry covered by the FLSA, including manufacturing, retail and service establishments, transportation companies, charities and private schools. The FLSA does not apply to domestic workers (in private homes), farm workers, and certain workers in the maritime industry.

As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers.

If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values. If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions \nwith a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities. But if I said that he was honest, \ncaring, forthright, and diligent, volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church, many \npeople would see Daniel as having certain ethical or moral qualities. If I said that he keeps the \nGolden Rule as well as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical person. But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1.

            "chunk": "(who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. \nUtilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each. The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money.

A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society,",

This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni. Etzioni was a founder of the \nCommunitarian Network, which is a group of individuals who have come together to bolster the moral, \nsocial, and political environment. It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope. \n \nThe relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: \n \n1. If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

            "chunk": "Aristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice. \n \nFrom a modern perspective, some of these virtues seem old-fashioned or even odd. Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy. [2] \n \nAs to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove \nhelpful. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n58 \nMichael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core values has been \nidentified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate \ndecisions. \n \nTo simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States. \nWhen you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, \npower, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality. They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But",

But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do. \n \nThe importance of an individual’s having these consistent qualities of character is well known. Often we \nremember the last bad thing a person did far more than any or all previous good acts. For example, Eliot \nSpitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good \nthey accomplished as public servants. As for a company, its good reputation also has an incalculable value \nthat when lost takes a great deal of time and work to recover. Shell, Nike, and other companies have \ndiscovered that there is a market for morality, however difficult to measure, and that not paying attention \nto business ethics often comes at a serious price. In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and \ncompliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal proceedings against companies but also \nbecause major companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered retroactively but must be \npursued proactively. For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue \nbecomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the same lesson. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThroughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers \nhave come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social \ncontract theory; and virtue ethics. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nXYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles. Customers \nhave had near-death experiences from sudden acceleration; they would be driving along a highway at normal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n60 \nspeed when suddenly the car would begin to accelerate, and efforts to stop the acceleration by braking fail to \nwork. Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to \ndo so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration. \nInternal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are \nnot being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal. In fact, there appears to be a \npossible flaw in both models, perhaps in a semiconductor chip, that makes sudden acceleration happen. \nInterference by floor mats and poorly designed gas pedals do not seem to be the problem. \nIt is voluntary to report these incidents to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), \nbut the company decides that it will wait awhile and see if there are more complaints. Recalling the two \nmodels so that local dealers and their mechanics could examine them is also an option, but it would be \nextremely costly. Company executives are aware that quarterly and annual profit-and-loss statements, on \nwhich their bonuses depend, could be decisively worse with a recall. They decide that on a cost-benefit basis, \nit makes more sense to wait until there are more accidents and more data. After a hundred or more accidents \nand nearly fifteen fatalities, the company institutes a selective recall, still not notifying NHTSA, which has its \nown experts and the authority to order XYZ to do a full recall of all affected models. \nExperts have advised XYZ that standard failure-analysis methodology requires that the company obtain \nabsolutely every XYZ vehicle that has experienced sudden acceleration, using microscopic analysis of all critical \ncomponents of the electronic system. The company does not wish to take that advice, as it would be—as one \ntop executive put it—“too time-consuming and expensive.” \n1. Can XYZ’s approach to this problem be justified under utilitarian theory? If so, how? If not, why not? \n2. What would Kant advise XYZ to do? Explain. \n3.

[3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and \nmodeled by the top of the organization. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n72 \n \nIt’s often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as top management is willing to make it. If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n73 \nIf you manage by the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers, based on the need to get \nstock price ever higher. At Enron, “15 percent a year or better earnings growth” was the mantra. Jeffrey \nPfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, observes how the belief that “stock \nprice is all that matters” has been hardwired into the corporate psyche. It dictates not only how people \njudge the worth of their company but also how they feel about themselves and the work that they are \ndoing. And, over time, it has clouded judgments about what is acceptable corporate behavior.

As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers. But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs. The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year",

New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n• \nThe long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to \nmeasure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially. \n• \nSears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant \ninformation about the service being offered. This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier. Sears, like other \nsellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would \nnot permit such information distortions. \n• \nPeople in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary. \n \nNoting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had \nlost sight of other goals for the organization. \n \nThe emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical. The \ntemptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write \nthe history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done. In a way, this \nfits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. \n \nConscious Capitalism \nOne effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious \ncapitalism movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7]",

Under \nthese circumstances, state judges will consult their own state’s case decisions involving conflicts of \nlaws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state’s laws to decide the case (see Table 3.1 \n\"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). \n \nAs state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal courts are often concerned with state law \nand with what happens in state courts. Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts. The Constitution \nestablished diversity jurisdiction because it was feared that local courts would be hostile toward \npeople from other states and that they would need separate courts. In 2009, nearly a third of all \nlawsuits filed in federal court were based on diversity of citizenship. In these cases, the federal courts \nwere applying state law, rather than taking federal question jurisdiction, where federal law \nprovided the basis for the lawsuit or where the United States was a party (as plaintiff or defendant). \n \nWhy are there so many diversity cases in federal courts? Defense lawyers believe that there is \nsometimes a “home-court advantage” for an in-state plaintiff who brings a lawsuit against a \nnonresident in his local state court. The defense attorney is entitled to ask for removal to a federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n84 \ncourt where there is diversity. This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial function \nhas original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to \nthem. A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in",

In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels. At the \nfirst level are the federal district courts, which are the trial courts in the federal system. Every state has \none or more federal districts; the less populous states have one, and the more populous states (California, \nTexas, and New York) have four. The federal court with the heaviest commercial docket is the US District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). There are forty-four district judges and fifteen \nmagistrates in this district. The district judges throughout the United States commonly preside over all \nfederal trials, both criminal and civil. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n87 \nCourts of Appeal \nCases from the district courts can then be appealed to the circuit courts of appeal, of which there are \nthirteen (Figure 3.1 \"The Federal Judicial Circuits\"). Each circuit oversees the work of the district courts in \nseveral states. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district \ncourts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears \nappeals from district courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, \nHawaii, and Guam. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals from the \ndistrict court in Washington, DC, as well as from numerous federal administrative agencies (see Chapter 5 \n\"Administrative Law\"). The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington, hears \nappeals in patent and customs cases. Appeals are usually heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes \nthere will be a rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges sit to hear the case “en \nbanc.” \n \nThere are also several specialized courts in the federal judicial system. These include the US Tax Court, \nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims. \n \nUnited States Supreme Court \nOverseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC. It consists of nine justices—the \nchief justice and eight associate justices. (This number is not constitutionally required; Congress can \nestablish any number. It has been set at nine since after the Civil War.) The Supreme Court has selective \ncontrol over most of its docket. By law, the cases it hears represent only a tiny fraction of the cases that are \nsubmitted. In 2008, the Supreme Court had numerous petitions (over 7,000, not including thousands of \npetitions from prisoners) but heard arguments in only 87 cases. The Supreme Court does not sit in panels. \nAll the justices hear and consider each case together, unless a justice has a conflict of interest and must \nwithdraw from hearing the case. \n \nFigure 3.1 The Federal Judicial Circuits \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n88 \n \nFederal judges—including Supreme Court justices—are nominated by the president and must be \nconfirmed by the Senate. Unlike state judges, who are usually elected and preside for a fixed term of years, \nfederal judges sit for life unless they voluntarily retire or are impeached. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nTrial courts and appellate courts have different functions. State trial courts sometimes hear cases with federal \nlaw issues, and federal courts sometimes hear cases with state law issues. Within both state and federal court \nsystems, it is useful to know the different kinds of courts and what cases they can decide. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why all of this complexity?

                    "answer": "The reason for this complexity is that the Constitution gives Congress the power to establish a federal court system and the power to regulate commerce. This allows the federal courts to hear cases involving interstate commerce, bankruptcy, and patent and copyright infringement. Additionally, the Constitution gives the federal courts the power to hear cases involving federal laws, such as those relating to the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States. State courts, on the other hand, are limited to hearing cases involving state laws. This is because state courts are created and funded by the states, and their jurisdiction is limited to the laws and regulations of the state. The federal court system also provides a uniform system of justice across the country, which is important for ensuring that all citizens have access to fair and impartial justice, regardless of where they live. Additionally, the federal court system provides a means for resolving disputes that may involve multiple states or parties, and for ensuring that the laws of the United States are enforced consistently across the country."

Iowa is the state where the plaintiff resides and where the plaintiff is more familiar with the laws and the court system. Additionally, the plaintiff may feel more comfortable and confident in the Iowa court system, as it is closer to home and the plaintiff may have a better understanding of the laws and procedures in Iowa. Moreover, if the plaintiff wins the case in Iowa, the plaintiff may be able to collect the judgment more easily in Iowa, as the plaintiff may have more assets in Iowa than in New Jersey. Furthermore, the plaintiff may be able to avoid the costs and delays associated with having the case heard in New Jersey, such as travel expenses and the need to hire an attorney who is familiar with New Jersey law and the New Jersey court system."

                    "answer": "The New Jersey court must certify the Iowa judgment because the Iowa judgment is not enforceable in New Jersey. The New Jersey court must certify the Iowa judgment in order for it to be recognized and enforced in New Jersey. This is because the Iowa judgment is a final judgment of a court in a different state, and the New Jersey court must determine whether the Iowa judgment is valid and enforceable in New Jersey. The New Jersey court will review the Iowa judgment to ensure that it was properly issued, that it was issued by a court with jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, and that it was not issued in violation of any New Jersey laws. If the New Jersey court finds that the Iowa judgment is valid and enforceable, it will certify the judgment and allow it to be enforced in New Jersey. This is important because it ensures that judgments issued in one state are recognized and enforced in other states, and that parties are not subject to the laws of multiple states when they are sued in different states."

The list of cases for exclusive \nfederal jurisdiction is fairly short. That means that almost any state court will have subject matter \njurisdiction over almost any kind of case. If it’s a case based on state law, a state court will always have \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n3 \nA federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case that is either based on a federal law \n(statute, case, or US Constitution) \nOR \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n95 \nA federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case based on state law where the parties \nare (1) from different states and (2) the amount in controversy is at least $75,000. \n(1) The different states requirement means that no plaintiff can have permanent residence in a state \nwhere any defendant has permanent residence—there must be complete diversity of citizenship as \nbetween all plaintiffs and defendants. \n(2) The amount in controversy requirement means that a good-faith estimate of the amount the \nplaintiff may recover is at least $75,000. \nNOTE: For purposes of permanent residence, a corporation is considered a resident where it is \nincorporated AND where it has a principal place of business. \n4 \nIn diversity cases, the following rules apply. \n(1) Federal civil procedure rules apply to how the case is conducted before and during trial \nand any appeals, but \n(2) State law will be used as the basis for a determination of legal rights and responsibilities. \n(a) This “choice of law” process is interesting but complicated. Basically, each state has \nits own set of judicial decisions that resolve conflict of laws. For example, just because \nA sues B in a Texas court, the Texas court will not necessarily apply Texas law. Anna \nand Bobby collide and suffer serious physical injuries while driving their cars in \nRoswell, New Mexico. Both live in Austin, and Bobby files a lawsuit in Austin. The \ncourt there could hear it (having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction \nover Bobby) but would apply New Mexico law, which governs motor vehicle laws and \naccidents in New Mexico. Why would the Texas judge do that? \n(b) The Texas judge knows that which state’s law is chosen to apply to the case can make \na decisive difference in the case, as different states have different substantive law \nstandards. For example, in a breach of contract case, one state’s version of the \nUniform Commercial Code may be different from another’s, and which one the court \ndecides to apply is often exceedingly good for one side and dismal for the other. \nIn Anna v. Bobby, if Texas has one kind of comparative negligence statute and New \nMexico has a different kind of comparative negligence statute, who wins or loses, or \nhow much is awarded, could well depend on which law applies. Because both were \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n96 \nunder the jurisdiction of New Mexico’s laws at the time, it makes sense to apply New \nMexico law. \n(3) Why do some nonresident defendants prefer to be in federal court? \n(a) In the state court, the judge is elected, and the jury may be familiar with or \nsympathetic to the “local” plaintiff. \n(b) The federal court provides a more neutral forum, with an appointed, life-tenured \njudge and a wider pool of potential jurors (drawn from a wider geographical area). \n(4) If a defendant does not want to be in state court and there is diversity, what is to be done? \n(a) Make a motion for removal to the federal court. \n(b) The federal court will not want to add to its caseload, or docket, but must take the \ncase unless there is not complete diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy \nis less than $75,000. \n \n \nTo better understand subject matter jurisdiction in action, let’s take an example. Wile E. Coyote wants a \nfederal judge to hear his products-liability action against Acme, Inc., even though the action is based on \nstate law. Mr. Coyote’s attorney wants to “make a federal case” out of it, thinking that the jurors in the \nfederal district court’s jury pool will understand the case better and be more likely to deliver a “high value” \nverdict for Mr. Coyote. Mr. Coyote resides in Arizona, and Acme is incorporated in the state of Delaware \nand has its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. The federal court in Arizona can hear and \ndecide Mr. Coyote’s case (i.e., it has subject matter jurisdiction over the case) because of diversity of \ncitizenship. If Mr. Coyote was injured by one of Acme’s defective products while chasing a roadrunner in \nArizona, the federal district court judge would hear his action—using federal procedural law—and decide \nthe case based on the substantive law of Arizona on product liability. \n \nBut now change the facts only slightly: Acme is incorporated in Delaware but has its principal place of",

They bought the vehicle in New York from a New York–based retailer. None of the other \ndefendants is from Oklahoma. \n \nThey file in an Oklahoma state court, but how will they (their attorney or the court) know if the state court \nhas subject matter jurisdiction? Unless the case is required to be in a federal court (i.e., unless the federal \ncourts have exclusive jurisdiction over this kind of case), any state court system will have subject matter \njurisdiction, including Oklahoma’s state court system. But if their claim is for a significant amount of \nmoney, they cannot file in small claims court, probate court, or any court in Oklahoma that does not have \nstatutory jurisdiction over their claim. They will need to file in a court of general jurisdiction. In short, \neven filing in the right court system (state versus federal), the plaintiff must be careful to find the court \nthat has subject matter jurisdiction. \n \nIf they wish to go to federal court, can they? There is no federal question presented here (the claim is \nbased on state common law), and the United States is not a party, so the only basis for federal court \njurisdiction would be diversity jurisdiction. If enough time has elapsed since the accident and they have \nestablished themselves as Arizona residents, they could sue in federal court in Oklahoma (or elsewhere), \nbut only if none of the defendants—the retailer, the regional Volkswagen company, Volkswagen of North \nAmerica, or Audi (in Germany) are incorporated in or have a principal place of business in Arizona. The \nfederal judge would decide the case using federal civil procedure but would have to make the appropriate \nchoice of state law.

Unless the defendant had some significant contact with the plaintiff’s state, the plaintiff may \nindeed have to. For instance, suppose a traveler from Maine stopped at a roadside diner in Montana and \nordered a slice of homemade pie that was tainted and caused him to be sick. The traveler may not simply \nreturn home and mail the diner a notice that he is suing it in a Maine court. But if out-of-state defendants \nhave some contact with the plaintiff’s state of residence, there might be grounds to bring them within the \njurisdiction of the plaintiff’s state courts. In Burger King v. Rudzewicz, Section 3.9 \"Cases\", the federal \ncourt in Florida had to consider whether it was constitutionally permissible to exercise personal \njurisdiction over a Michigan franchisee. \n \nAgain, recall that even if a court has subject matter jurisdiction, it must also have personal jurisdiction \nover each defendant against whom an enforceable judgment can be made. Often this is not a problem; you \nmight be suing a person who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state. Or a nonresident \nmay answer your complaint without objecting to the court’s “in personam” (personal) jurisdiction. But \nmany defendants who do not reside in the state where the lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the \ninconvenience of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum. Fairness—and the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment—dictates that nonresidents should not be required to defend lawsuits far from \ntheir home base, especially where there is little or no contact or connection between the nonresident and \nthe state where a lawsuit is brought. \n \nSummary of Rules on Personal Jurisdiction \n1. \nOnce a court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction, it must find at least one defendant \nover which it is “fair” (i.e., in accord with due process) to exercise personal jurisdiction. \n2. If a plaintiff sues five defendants and the court has personal jurisdiction over just one, the case \ncan be heard, but the court cannot make a judgment against the other four. \n1. \nBut if the plaintiff loses against defendant 1, he can go elsewhere (to another state or \nstates) and sue defendants 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n2. The court’s decision in the first lawsuit (against defendant 1) does not determine the \nliability of the nonparticipating defendants. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n103 \nThis involves the principle of res judicata, which means that you can’t bring the same action \nagainst the same person (or entity) twice. It’s like the civil side of double jeopardy. Res means \n“thing,” and judicata means “adjudicated.” Thus the “thing” has been “adjudicated” and \nshould not be judged again. But, as to nonparticipating parties, it is not over. If you have \na different case against the same defendant—one that arises out of a completely different \nsituation—that case is not barred by res judicata. \n3. Service of process is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting personal jurisdiction \nover a particular defendant (see rule 4). \n1. \nIn order to get a judgment in a civil action, the plaintiff must serve a copy of the \ncomplaint and a summons on the defendant. \n2. There are many ways to do this. \n• \nThe process server personally serves a complaint on the defendant. \n• \nThe process server leaves a copy of the summons and complaint at the residence \nof the defendant, in the hands of a competent person. \n• \nThe process server sends the summons and complaint by certified mail, return \nreceipt requested. \n• \nThe process server, if all other means are not possible, notifies the defendant by \npublication in a newspaper having a minimum number of readers (as may be \nspecified by law). \n4. In addition to successfully serving the defendant with process, a plaintiff must convince the court \nthat exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant is consistent with due process and any \nstatutes in that state that prescribe the jurisdictional reach of that state (the so-called long-arm \nstatutes). The Supreme Court has long recognized various bases for judging whether such process \nis fair. \n1. \nConsent. The defendant agrees to the court’s jurisdiction by coming to court, answering \nthe complaint, and having the matter litigated there. \n2. Domicile. The defendant is a permanent resident of that state. \n3. Event. The defendant did something in that state, related to the lawsuit, that makes it fair \nfor the state to say, “Come back and defend!” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n104 \n4. Service of process within the state will effectively provide personal jurisdiction over the \nnonresident. \n \nAgain, let’s consider Mrs. Robinson and her children in the Audi accident.

These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail. Cases can be decided \non the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the \ncourt can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks. (2) The defendant can move to \ndismiss the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to “state a claim on which relief can be \ngranted,” or on the basis that there is no subject matter jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, \nor on the basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is saying, in effect, \nthat even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by \nthe court. For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-\ncalled alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will \ndismiss the complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a \ndemurrer.) \n \nA third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment. If there is no triable \nquestion of fact or law, there is no reason to have a trial. For example, the plaintiff sues on a promissory \nnote and, at deposition (an oral examination under oath), the defendant admits having made no payment \non the note and offers no excuse that would be recognizable as a reason not to pay. There is no reason to \nhave a trial, and the court should grant summary judgment. \n \nDiscovery \nIf there is a factual dispute, the case will usually involve some degree of discovery, where each party tries \nto get as much information out of the other party as the rules allow. Until the 1940s, when discovery \nbecame part of civil procedure rules, a lawsuit was frequently a game in which each party hid as much \ninformation as possible and tried to surprise the other party in court. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n109 \nBeginning with a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in 1938 \nand subsequently followed by many of the states, the parties are entitled to learn the facts of the case \nbefore trial. The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a",

A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant. Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial. \nFor the most part, courts of appeal will not reverse and remand for a new trial unless the trial court \njudge’s errors are “prejudicial,” or “an abuse of discretion.” In short, neither party is entitled to a perfect \ntrial, but only to a fair trial, one in which the trial judge has made only “harmless errors” and not \nprejudicial ones. \n \nAt the end of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant presents his case, following the same procedure just \noutlined. The plaintiff is then entitled to present rebuttal witnesses, if necessary, to deny or argue with the \nevidence the defendant has introduced. The defendant in turn may present “surrebuttal” witnesses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n114 \n \nWhen all testimony has been introduced, either party may ask the judge for a directed verdict—a \nverdict decided by the judge without advice from the jury. This motion may be granted if the plaintiff has \nfailed to introduce evidence that is legally sufficient to meet her burden of proof or if the defendant has \nfailed to do the same on issues on which she has the burden of proof. (For example, the plaintiff alleges \nthat the defendant owes him money and introduces a signed promissory note. The defendant cannot show \nthat the note is invalid. The defendant must lose the case unless he can show that the debt has been paid \nor otherwise discharged.) \n \nThe defendant can move for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff’s case, but the judge will usually \nwait to hear the entire case until deciding whether to do so. Directed verdicts are not usually granted, \nsince it is the jury’s job to determine the facts in dispute. \n \nIf the judge refuses to grant a directed verdict, each lawyer will then present a closing argument to the \njury (or, if there is no jury, to the judge alone). The closing argument is used to tie up the loose ends, as \nthe attorney tries to bring together various seemingly unrelated facts into a story that will make sense to \nthe jury. \n \nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury. The purpose of jury instruction is to explain to \nthe jurors the meaning of the law as it relates to the issues they are considering and to tell the jurors what \nfacts they must determine if they are to give a verdict for one party or the other. Each lawyer will have \nprepared a set of written instructions that she hopes the judge will give to the jury. These will be tailored \nto advance her client’s case. Many a verdict has been overturned on appeal because a trial judge has \nwrongly instructed the jury. The judge will carefully determine which instructions to give and often will \nuse a set of pattern instructions provided by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state. \nThese pattern jury instructions are often safer because they are patterned after language that appellate \ncourts have used previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible error in the instructions. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n115 \nAfter all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a private room and discuss the case and the answers \nrequested by the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict.

When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their \nlawyers present. The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge. (If there is no \njury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to \nthose facts. Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is.

After reading the briefs on appeal, the appellate court may dispose of the appeal without \nargument, issuing a written opinion that may be very short or many pages. Often, though, the appellate \ncourt will hear oral argument. (This can be months, or even more than a year after the briefs are filed.) \nEach lawyer is given a short period of time, usually no more than thirty minutes, to present his client’s \ncase. The lawyer rarely gets a chance for an extended statement because he is usually interrupted by \nquestions from the judges.

The application of that rule will vary \nwith the quality and nature of the defendant’s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be \nsome act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities \nwithin the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. \n \nThis “purposeful availment” requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction \nsolely as a result of “random,” “fortuitous,” or “attenuated” contacts, or of the “unilateral activity of \nanother party or a third person,” [Citations] Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts \nproximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a “substantial connection” with the \nforum State. [Citations] Thus where the defendant “deliberately” has engaged in significant activities \nwithin a State, or has created “continuing obligations” between himself and residents of the forum, he \nmanifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are \nshielded by “the benefits and protections” of the forum’s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to \nrequire him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well. \n \nJurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically \nenter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s \naffiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of \nmodern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire \ncommunications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which \nbusiness is conducted. So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are “purposefully directed” toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat \npersonal jurisdiction there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n133 \n \nOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum \nState, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of \npersonal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S., at 320. Thus courts in “appropriate case[s]” may evaluate “the burden on the \ndefendant,” “the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining \nconvenient and effective relief,” “the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient \nresolution of controversies,” and the “shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental \nsubstantive social policies.” These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of \njurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required.

Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the \nConstitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics \nof the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as \nthe right of states to be free from federal antidiscrimination laws. See, for example, Kimel v. Florida \nBoard of Regents, or the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case (Section 4.6.5), which held \nthat corporations are “persons” with “free speech rights” that include spending unlimited amounts of \nmoney in campaign donations and political advocacy.

This may not seem like a “business case,” but consider: the manufacture and \ndistribution of birth control devices is a highly profitable (and legal) business in every US state. Moreover, \nGriswold illustrates another important and much-debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive \ndue process (see Section 4.5.3 \"Fifth Amendment\"). The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is \nbrought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business \nafter Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited \nrather than overruled Roe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, \nand efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In \ndeciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the \nSupreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the \nConstitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its \ninterpretation. Only a constitutional amendment or the court’s repudiation of Roe v. Wade as a precedent \ncould change that interpretation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n145 \nThe Constitution gives voice to the idea that people have basic rights and that a civilian president is also the \ncommander in chief of the armed forces.

It does not \nexpressly allow for judicial review, but the Supreme Court’s ability to declare what laws are (or are not) \nconstitutional has given the judicial branch a kind of power not seen in other industrialized democracies. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging \nthat Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides \na federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional. In \ndismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section \n13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly \nidentified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA. Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed, as \ndid the Supreme Court. \n \nThe Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the authority to enact a statute under the commerce clause \nor the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute did not regulate an activity that substantially affected \ninterstate commerce nor did it redress harm caused by the state. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist \nwrote for the court that “under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and not by the United States.” Dissenting, Justice Stephen G. Breyer argued that the majority \nopinion “illustrates the difficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause touchstone.” Justice \nDavid H. Souter, dissenting, noted that VAWA contained a “mountain of data assembled by \nCongress…showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce.” \n \nThe absence of a workable judicial commerce clause touchstone remains. In 1996, California voters \npassed the Compassionate Use Act, legalizing marijuana for medical use. California’s law conflicted with \nthe federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which banned possession of marijuana. After the Drug \nEnforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-prescribed marijuana from a patient’s home, a group of \nmedical marijuana users sued the DEA and US Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court. \n \nThe medical marijuana users argued that the CSA—which Congress passed using its constitutional power \nto regulate interstate commerce—exceeded Congress’s commerce clause power. The district court ruled \nagainst the group, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional \nbecause it applied to medical marijuana use solely within one state. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit relied \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n152 \non U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000) to say that using medical marijuana did not \n“substantially affect” interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress. \n \nBut by a 6–3 majority, the Supreme Court held that the commerce clause gave Congress authority to \nprohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana, despite state law to the contrary. Justice John Paul \nStevens argued that the court’s precedents established Congress’s commerce clause power to regulate \npurely local activities that are part of a “class of activities” with a substantial effect on interstate \ncommerce. The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a \nclass of activities: the national marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in the national \nmarijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use “essential” to regulating the drug’s national \nmarket. \nNotice how similar this reasoning is to the court’s earlier reasoning in Wickard v. Filburn (Section 4.6.2). \nIn contrast, the court’s conservative wing was adamant that federal power had been exceeded. Justice \nClarence Thomas’s dissent in Gonzalez v. Raich stated that Raich’s local cultivation and consumption of \nmarijuana was not “Commerce…among the several States.” Representing the “originalist” view that the \nConstitution should mostly mean what the Founders meant it to mean, he also said that in the early days \nof the republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, \npossession, and consumption of marijuana. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe commerce clause is the basis on which the federal government regulates interstate economic activity.

For example, when Congress determined in the 1950s to promote nuclear \npower (“atoms for peace”), it set up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and provided a limitation of \nliability for nuclear power plants in case of a nuclear accident. The states were expressly told to stay out of \nthe business of regulating nuclear power or the movement of nuclear materials.

Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that sets standards for \nforeign vessels to enter the navigable waters and ports of the United States. If a state creates a law that \nsets standards that conflict with the federal law or sets standards so burdensome that they interfere with \nfederal law, the doctrine of preemption will (in accordance with the supremacy clause) void the state \nlaw or whatever parts of it are inconsistent with federal law.",

It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public \nofficials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the \nprotection of the First Amendment. \n \nPolitical speech is so highly protected that the court has recognized the right of people to support political \ncandidates through campaign contributions and thus promote the particular viewpoints and speech of \nthose candidates. Fearing the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to time placed \nlimitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns. But the Supreme Court has had mixed \nreactions over time. Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment right of a corporation to donate \nmoney, subject to certain limits. [2] In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), the \nMichigan Campaign Finance Act prohibited corporations from using treasury money for independent \nexpenditures to support or oppose candidates in elections for state offices. But a corporation could make \nsuch expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely for political purposes. The law was \npassed on the assumption that “the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitate \nsome regulation of their political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.” \n \nThe Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support a candidate for Michigan’s House of \nRepresentatives by using general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and argued that as a \nnonprofit organization, it was not really like a business firm. The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan \nlaw. Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a business group, given its activities, linkages \nwith community business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75 percent) that were business \ncorporations. Furthermore, Justice Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and \nimplemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining integrity in the political process. But as you \nwill see in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\"), Austin was overruled; \ncorporations are recognized as “persons” with First Amendment political speech rights that cannot be \nimpaired by Congress or the states without some compelling governmental interest with restrictions on \nthose rights that are “narrowly tailored.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n166 \n \nFourth Amendment \nThe Fourth Amendment says, “all persons shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a \nmagistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons to be searched and places to be seized.” \n \nThe court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that \nare “unreasonable.” Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is “closely regulated” can be \nsearched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a \njunkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search \nthat found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, \nbecause the dealer was in a “closely regulated industry.” \n \nIn the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nThe EPA had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow plant, using an aerial mapping \ncamera to photograph various pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof. Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional. Because the literal language of the Fourth Amendment protected “persons, houses, papers, \nand effects,” anything searched by the government in “open fields” was reasonable. (The court’s opinion \nsuggested that if Dow had really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could have covered the \npipes and machinery that were otherwise outside and in open fields.) \n \nNote again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your \nemployer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits.

In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents \ngovernment from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also \nconstitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair. This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger \nKing v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, \nbut the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely \ncontract with one another. Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down \nthat aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions. \nHowever, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of \nlaws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties. The first category",

            "chunk": "in an Alabama court not too long ago. [5] \nThe plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW for $40,000 from a dealer in Alabama. He later discovered \nthat the vehicle’s exterior had been slightly damaged in transit from Europe and had therefore been \nrepainted by the North American distributor prior to his purchase. The vehicle was, by best estimates, \nworth about 10 percent less than he paid for it. The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely \nsold slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of \nthe car. In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages. The \nAlabama trial jury considered that BMW was engaging in a fraudulent practice and wanted to punish the \ndefendant for a number of frauds it estimated at somewhere around a thousand nationwide. The jury \nawarded not only the $4,000 in compensatory damages but also $4 million in punitive damages, which \nwas later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. On appeal to the US Supreme Court, the \ncourt found that punitive damages may not be “grossly excessive.” If they are, then they violate \nsubstantive due process. Whatever damages a state awards must be limited to what is reasonably \nnecessary to vindicate the state’s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. \n \n“Equal protection of the laws” is a phrase that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868. \nThe amendment provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.” This is the equal protection clause. It means that, generally speaking, \ngovernments must treat people equally. Unfair classifications among people or corporations will not be \npermitted. A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white \nchildren and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public \nservices, such as water fountains or restrooms. Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954). [6] \n \nGovernments make classifications every day, so not all classifications can be illegal under the equal \nprotection clause. People with more income generally pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n171 \nPeople with proper medical training are licensed to become doctors; people without that training cannot \nbe licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do practice medicine. To know what classifications are \npermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified. The court has \ncreated three classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by \nknowing how the court is likely to classify the case: \n \n• \nMinimal scrutiny: economic and social relations. Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights. Classifications based on any of these are \nalmost never upheld. \n \nUnder minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues \nare presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen. For example, suppose that the city council decreed that all street vendors must be women, thinking \nthat would attract even more tourism. A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner \ntest than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to \nsubstantially relate to important government objectives. Increasingly, courts have nullified government \nsex classifications as societal concern with gender equality has grown. (See Shannon Faulkner’s case \nagainst The Citadel, an all-male state school.) [7] \n \nSuppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could \ndrive a taxicab or be a street vendor. That kind of classification would be examined with strict scrutiny to \nsee if there was any compelling justification for it. As noted, classifications such as this one are almost \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n172 \nnever upheld. The law would be upheld only if it were necessary to promote a compelling state interest. \nVery few laws that have a racial or ethnic classification meet that test. \n \nThe strict scrutiny test will be applied to classifications involving racial and ethnic criteria as well as",

As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections. The concern over backing \ncapability also is insignificant, because it seldom is necessary to back up on an interstate. In any event, no \nevidence suggested any difference in backing capability between the 60-foot doubles that Iowa permits \nand the 65-foot doubles that it bans. Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than \nsingles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles. \n \nStatistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and \n60-foot doubles. One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative \naccident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles. Each kind of truck was driven 56 million \nmiles on identical routes. The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one \nfatality. The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Iowa’s \nexpert statistician admitted that this study provided “moderately strong evidence” that singles have a \nhigher injury rate than doubles. Another study, prepared by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the \nrequest of the state legislature, concluded that “[s]ixty-five foot twin trailer combinations have not been \nshown by experiences in other states to be less safe than 60-foot twin trailer \ncombinations or conventional tractor-semitrailers.” \n \nIn sum, although Iowa introduced more evidence on the question of safety than did Wisconsin \nin Raymond, the record as a whole was not more favorable to the State. \n \nB \nConsolidated, meanwhile, demonstrated that Iowa’s law substantially burdens interstate commerce. \nTrucking companies that wish to continue to use 65-foot doubles must route them around Iowa or detach \nthe trailers of the doubles and ship them through separately. Alternatively, trucking companies must use \nthe smaller 55-foot singles or 65-foot doubles permitted under Iowa law. Each of these options engenders \ninefficiency and added expense. The record shows that Iowa’s law added about $12.6 million each year to \nthe costs of trucking companies. \n \nConsolidated alone incurred about $2 million per year in increased costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n185 \n \nIn addition to increasing the costs of the trucking companies (and, indirectly, of the service to \nconsumers), Iowa’s law may aggravate, rather than, ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents. Fifty-\nfive-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles. Either more small trucks must be used to carry the \nsame quantity of goods through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks must drive longer distances to \nbypass Iowa. In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be \ndriven to transport the same quantity of goods. Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to \ndistance traveled. Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa’s law tends to increase the \nnumber of accidents and to shift the incidence of them from Iowa to other States. \n \n[IV. Omitted] \nV \nIn sum, the statutory exemptions, their history, and the arguments Iowa has advanced in support of its \nlaw in this litigation all suggest that the deference traditionally accorded a State’s safety judgment is not \nwarranted. See Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 444-447. The controlling factors thus are the findings of \nthe District Court, accepted by the Court of Appeals, with respect to the relative safety of the types of \ntrucks at issue, and the substantiality of the burden on interstate commerce. \n \nBecause Iowa has imposed this burden without any significant countervailing safety interest, its statute \nviolates the Commerce Clause. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n \nIt is so ordered. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Constitution sets the framework for all other laws of the United States, at both the federal and the \nstate level. It creates a shared balance of power between states and the federal government (federalism) \nand shared power among the branches of government (separation of powers), establishes individual rights \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n200 \nagainst governmental action (Bill of Rights), and provides for federal oversight of matters affecting \ninterstate commerce and commerce with foreign nations. Knowing the contours of the US legal system is \nnot possible without understanding the role of the US Constitution. \n \nThe Constitution is difficult to amend. Thus when the Supreme Court uses its power of judicial review to \ndetermine that a law is unconstitutional, it actually shapes what the Constitution means. New meanings \nthat emerge must do so by the process of amendment or by the passage of time and new appointments to \nthe court. Because justices serve for life, the court changes its philosophical outlook slowly. \n \nThe Bill of Rights is an especially important piece of the Constitutional framework. It provides legal \ncauses of action for infringements of individual rights by government, state or federal. Through the due \nprocess clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, both procedural and (to some \nextent) substantive due process rights are given to individuals. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. For many years, the Supreme Court believed that “commercial speech” was entitled to less protection \nthan other forms of speech. One defining element of commercial speech is that its dominant theme is \nto propose a commercial transaction. This kind of speech is protected by the First Amendment, but the \ngovernment is permitted to regulate it more closely than other forms of speech. However, the \ngovernment must make reasonable distinctions, must narrowly tailor the rules restricting commercial \nspeech, and must show that government has a legitimate goal that the law furthers. \nEdward Salib owned a Winchell’s Donut House in Mesa, Arizona. To attract customers, he displayed \nlarge signs in store windows. The city ordered him to remove the signs because they violated the city’s \nsign code, which prohibited covering more than 30 percent of a store’s windows with signs. Salib sued, \nclaiming that the sign code violated his First Amendment rights. What was the result, and why? \n2. Jennifer is a freshman at her local public high school.

United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers \nto an agency. In later decisions, it was made clear that Congress could delegate some of its legislative \npowers, but only if the delegation of authority was not overly broad. \n \nStill, some congressional enabling acts are very broad, such as the enabling legislation for the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is given the authority to make rules to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n212 \nprovide for safe and healthful working conditions in US workplaces. Such a broad initiative power gives \nOSHA considerable discretion. But, as noted in Section 5.2 \"Controlling Administrative Agencies\", there \nare both executive and judicial controls over administrative agency activities, as well as ongoing control by \nCongress through funding and the continuing oversight of agencies, both in hearings and through \nsubsequent statutory amendments. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCongress creates administrative agencies through enabling acts. In these acts, Congress must delegate \nauthority by giving the agency some direction as to what it wants the agency to do. Agencies are usually given \nbroad powers to investigate, set standards (promulgating regulations), and enforce those standards. Most \nagencies are executive branch agencies, but some are independent. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Explain why Congress needs to delegate rule-making authority to a specialized agency. \n2. Explain why there is any need for interference in the market by means of laws or regulations. \n \n  \n \n[1] Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 US 495 (1935). \n \n \n \n \n \n5.2 Controlling Administrative Agencies \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how the president controls administrative agencies. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n213 \n2. Understand how Congress controls administrative agencies. \n3. Understand how the courts can control administrative agencies. \n \n \nDuring the course of the past seventy years, a substantial debate has been conducted, often in shrill \nterms, about the legitimacy of administrative lawmaking. One criticism is that agencies are \n“captured” by the industry they are directed to regulate. Another is that they overregulate, stifling \nindividual initiative and the ability to compete. During the 1960s and 1970s, a massive outpouring of \nfederal law created many new agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones. In the \nlate 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress began to deregulate American society, and \nderegulation increased under the Reagan administration. But the accounting frauds of WorldCom, \nEnron, and others led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown of 2008 has \nled to reregulation of the financial sector. It remains to be seen whether the Deepwater Horizon oil \nblowout of 2010 will lead to more environmental regulations or a rethinking on how to make \nagencies more effective regulators. \n \nAdministrative agencies are the focal point of controversy because they are policy-making bodies, \nincorporating facets of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form that fits uneasily at \nbest in the framework of American government (see Figure 5.1 \"Major Administrative Agencies of the \nUnited States\"). They are necessarily at the center of tugging and hauling by the legislature, the \nexecutive branch, and the judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising political control \nover them. In early 1990, for example, the Bush administration approved a Food and Drug \nAdministration regulation that limited disease-prevention claims by food packagers, reversing a \nposition by the Reagan administration in 1987 permitting such claims. \n \nFigure 5.1 Major Administrative Agencies of the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n214 \n \n \nLegislative Control \nCongress can always pass a law repealing a regulation that an agency promulgates. Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control",

The inspector \nanswered no, but that Barlow’s, Inc., had simply turned up in the agency’s selection process. The inspector \nagain asked to enter the nonpublic area of the business; Mr. Barlow’s response was to inquire whether the \ninspector had a search warrant. \nThe inspector had none. Thereupon, Mr. Barlow refused the inspector admission to the employee area of \nhis business. He said he was relying on his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. \n \nThree months later, the Secretary petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to \nissue an order compelling Mr. Barlow to admit the inspector. The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries \n“long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. \n72, 74, 77 (1970). These cases are indeed exceptions, but they represent responses to relatively unique \ncircumstances. Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise. Liquor \n(Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a \nbusiness, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation. \n \n* * * \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n231 \nThe clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved \nin Colonnade and Biswell is the exception.

In 1978, the Secretary, acting through the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated a standard limiting occupational \nexposure to cotton dust, an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton \nproducts, exposure to which produces a “constellation of respiratory effects” known as “byssinosis.” This \ndisease was one of the expressly recognized health hazards that led to passage of the Act. \n \nPetitioners in these consolidated cases representing the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the \nvalidity of the “Cotton Dust Standard” in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \npursuant to § 6 (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 655 (f).

In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set \nin the United States through the Constitution’s prohibition on “cruel or unusual punishments.” \n \nIt is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. But there are far too many criminal laws for \nanyone to know them all. Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of \n“criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving \nwithout a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society. You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws. Teenagers hanging around \nthe sidewalks on Main Street were sometimes arrested for “loitering.” The constitutional void-for-\nvagueness doctrine has led the courts to overturn statutes that are not clear. For example, “vagrancy” \nwas long held to be a crime, but US courts began some forty years ago to overturn vagrancy and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n243 \n“suspicious person” statutes on the grounds that they are too vague for people to know what they are \nbeing asked not to do. \nThis requirement that criminal statutes not be vague does not mean that the law always defines \ncrimes in ways that can be easily and clearly understood. Many statutes use terminology developed \nby the common-law courts. For example, a California statute defines murder as “the unlawful killing \nof a human being, with malice aforethought.” If no history backed up these words, they would be \nunconstitutionally vague. But there is a rich history of judicial decisions that provides meaning for \nmuch of the arcane language like “malice aforethought” strewn about in the statute books. \n \nBecause a crime is an act that the legislature has defined as socially harmful, the parties involved \ncannot agree among themselves to forget a particular incident, such as a barroom brawl, if the \nauthorities decide to prosecute. This is one of the critical distinctions between criminal and civil law. \nAn assault is both a crime and a tort. The person who was assaulted may choose to forgive his \nassailant and not to sue him for damages. But he cannot stop the prosecutor from bringing an \nindictment against the assailant. (However, because of crowded dockets, a victim that declines to \npress charges may cause a busy prosecutor to choose to not to bring an indictment.) \n \nA crime consists of an act defined as criminal—an actus reus—and the requisite “criminal intent.” \nSomeone who has a burning desire to kill a rival in business or romance and who may actually intend \nto murder but does not act on his desire has not committed a crime. He may have a “guilty mind”—\nthe translation of the Latin phrase mens rea—but he is guilty of no crime. A person who is forced to \ncommit a crime at gunpoint is not guilty of a crime, because although there was an act defined as \ncriminal—an actus reus—there was no criminal intent. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCrimes are usually defined by statute and constitute an offense against society.

Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat \ncommonly is to expose some fact of the victim’s private life or to make a false accusation about him. \n \nOffenses against Habitation and Other Offenses \nBurglary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n250 \nBurglary is not a crime against property. It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of \nanother in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who \nsneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out \nthe act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room \nfor argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a \nclosed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? \nWhose dwelling? Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person burglarize his \nown home? (No.) \n \nArson \nUnder common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one’s own \nhouse for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law. The statutes today \nmake it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not \nthe purpose is to collect insurance. \nBribery \nBribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in \ncash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find valuable. Under \ncommon law, only a public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges can result from the \nbribe of anyone performing a public function. \n \nBribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. \nBribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. \n \nPerjury \nPerjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official \nproceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”). To be \nperjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without \nsincere belief that it was true. An innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is perjury if \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n251 \nthe maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my \nknowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury. To support a \ncharge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant \nto whatever the court is trying to find out. \n \nWhite-Collar Crime \nWhite-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried \nout in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, \nbut embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory \ndefinitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law. Depending on how they \nare carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law. \n \nAny act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls \nor Internet connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many different acts around the buying and \nselling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws. Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who",

The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison). States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense. If Barney (who has poor sight), shoots at a tree stump, thinking it is his \nneighbor, Ralph, intending to kill him, has he committed an attempt? Many courts would hold that he has \nnot. But the distinction between factual impossibility and legal impossibility is not always clear, and the \ntrend seems to be to punish the intended attempt. \n \nConspiracy \nUnder both federal and state laws, it is a separate offense to work with others toward the commission of a \ncrime. When two or more people combine to carry out an unlawful purpose, they are engaged in a \nconspiracy. The law of conspiracy is quite broad, especially when it is used by prosecutors in connection \nwith white-collar crimes. Many people can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is unnecessary \nto show that the actions they took were sufficient to constitute either the crime or an attempt. Usually, the \nprosecution needs to show only (1) an agreement and (2) a single overt act in furtherance of the \nconspiracy. Thus if three people agree to rob a bank, and if one of them goes to a store to purchase a gun \nto be used in the holdup, the three can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery. Even the purchase \nof an automobile to be used as the getaway car could support a conspiracy conviction. \n \nThe act of any one of the conspirators is imputed to the other members of the conspiracy. It does not \nmatter, for instance, that only one of the bank robbers fired the gun that killed a guard. All can be \nconvicted of murder. That is so even if one of the conspirators was stationed as a lookout several blocks \naway and even if he specifically told the others that his agreement to cooperate would end “just as soon as \nthere is shooting.” \n \nAgency and Corporations \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n257 \nA person can be guilty of a crime if he acts through another. Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the \nguilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But imputation of guilt is not \nlimited to a conspiracy. The agent may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate officer \ndirects a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home. The employee \nreasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains \nmoney that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit. The law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in recent years. The tendency is to hold \nthe corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group \nwithin the corporation (the president or board of directors). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAlthough proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by \ninference (circumstantially). Conspirators may not actually commit a crime, for example, but in preparing for a \ncriminal act, they may be guilty of the crime of conspiracy.

Explain why criminal law generally requires that the defendant charged with a crime have criminal \"intent.\" \n2. Know and explain the possible excuses relating to responsibility that are legally recognized by courts, \nincluding lack of capacity. \n \n \nIn General \nThe mens rea requirement depends on the nature of the crime and all the circumstances surrounding the \nact. In general, though, the requirement means that the accused must in some way have intended the \ncriminal consequences of his act. Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison capsule to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n259 \nswallow. That is the act. If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his \nstate of mind was. Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her, the act was murder. \nWhat if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison but believing that it would only make her \nmildly ill? The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that \nmay cause harm to others. But suppose that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her two \npills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) \nbut that turned out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he had neither intent nor a state of \nknowledge from which intent could be inferred. \n \nNot every criminal law requires criminal intent as an ingredient of the crime. Many regulatory codes \ndealing with the public health and safety impose strict requirements. Failure to adhere to such \nrequirements is a violation, whether or not the violator had mens rea. The United States v. \nPark case, Section 6.7 \"Cases\", a decision of the US Supreme Court, shows the different considerations \ninvolved in mens rea. \n \nExcuses That Limit or Overcome Responsibility \nMistake of Fact and Mistake of Law \nOrdinarily, ignorance of the law is not an excuse. If you believe that it is permissible to turn right on a red \nlight but the city ordinance prohibits it, your belief, even if reasonable, does not excuse your violation of \nthe law. Under certain circumstances, however, ignorance of law will be excused. If a statute imposes \ncriminal penalties for an action taken without a license, and if the government official responsible for \nissuing the license formally tells you that you do not need one (though in fact you do), a conviction for \nviolating the statute cannot stand. In rare cases, a lawyer’s advice, contrary to the statute, will be held to \nexcuse the client, but usually the client is responsible for his attorney’s mistakes. Otherwise, as it is said, \nthe lawyer would be superior to the law. \n \nIgnorance or mistake of fact more frequently will serve as an excuse. If you take a coat from a restaurant, \nbelieving it to be yours, you cannot be convicted of larceny if it is not. Your honest mistake of fact negates \nthe requisite intent. In general, the rule is that a mistaken belief of fact will excuse criminal responsibility \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n260 \nif (1) the belief is honestly held, (2) it is reasonable to hold it, and (3) the act would not have been criminal \nif the facts were as the accused supposed them to have been. \n \nEntrapment \nOne common technique of criminal investigation is the use of an undercover agent or decoy—the \npoliceman who poses as a buyer of drugs from a street dealer or the elaborate “sting” operations in which \nostensibly stolen goods are “sold” to underworld “fences.” Sometimes these methods are the only way by \nwhich certain kinds of crime can be rooted out and convictions secured. \n \nBut a rule against entrapment limits the legal ability of the police to play the role of criminals.

            "chunk": "means straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting \nsomeone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet \nthe law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a \nremedy for \"defaming\" someone, orally or in writing, to others. \n \nAlthough the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines. More and \nmore people injured by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of remedy through the \ncourts). Headlines boast of multimillion-dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations, \nagainst newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against oil companies that devastate entire \necosystems. All are examples of tort suits. \n \nThe law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by \nlegislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the \ncommon law (judicial decisions). Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules \nthat govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other. Through \ncontracts, individuals can craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other. In the absence of \ncontracts, tort law holds individuals legally accountable for the consequences of their actions. Those who \nsuffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated. \n \nMany acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious. But torts and crimes are different, and the \ndifference is worth noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society punishes the murderer; \nit does not usually compensate the family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a \nprivate wrong for which damages are owed. In a civil case, the tort victim or his family, not the state, \nbrings the action. The judgment against a defendant in a civil tort suit is usually expressed in monetary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n283 \nterms, not in terms of prison times or fines, and is the legal system’s way of trying to make up for the \nvictim’s loss. \n \nKinds of Torts \nThere are three kinds of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts, and strict liability torts. Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.

One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still another excuse is consent: two \nboxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear). \n \nDamages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n286 \nSince the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually \nmeasured by the extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the",

Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution \nMalicious prosecution is the tort of causing someone to be prosecuted for a criminal act, knowing that \nthere was no probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committed the crime. The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3] \n \nA statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A \nstatement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major \nnetwork weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show \nthat the words were aimed at them. But statements about large groups will not support an action for \ndefamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor). \nThe law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That a person did not intend to defame is \nordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, \nmagazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due care \nis usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel \ncannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else. Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel. In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement. It may be difficult to \nestablish damages, however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the \nslander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

If a driver runs a red light, we can say that he is negligent \nbecause a driver must always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be able to stop if it is. \nSuppose that the driver was carrying a badly injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing \ndown at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n298 \nseeing him, drove into the intersection anyway and crashed into him. Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot? (Answer: in most cases, yes.) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n299 \nDespite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable man is one on which most negligence cases \nultimately turn. If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed \nan unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most \ninstances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do. The reasonable man stops for \ntraffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs \nsurgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of \nhis grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions \nto avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The \"reasonable man\" standard imposes hindsight \non the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may \nsometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable. \n \nDuty of Care and Its Breach \nThe law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person. If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in \nthis interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might \nsubject us to liability for its effect on someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the \nnumber of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful. \n \nIn general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the \ndrowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase. For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold.",

For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold. \nThis limitation was known as the rule of privity. And users who were not immediate purchasers were said \nnot to be in privity with a supplier or manufacturer. In 1916, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, then on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n300 \nNew York Court of Appeals, penned an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of privity, \nthough it would take half a century before the last state—Mississippi in 1966—would fall in line. \nDetermining a duty of care can be a vexing problem. Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of \nmedical ethics to respect the confidences of their patients. Suppose a patient tells a psychiatrist that he \nintends to kill his girlfriend. Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn prospective victim? \nThe California Supreme Court has said yes. [1] \n \nEstablishing a breach of the duty of due care where the defendant has violated a statute or municipal \nordinance is eased considerably with the doctrine of negligence per se, a doctrine common to all US \nstate courts. If a legislative body sets a minimum standard of care for particular kinds of acts to protect a \ncertain set of people from harm and a violation of that standard causes harm to someone in that set, the \ndefendant is negligent per se. If Harvey is driving sixty-five miles per hour in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour \nzone when he crashes into Haley’s car and the police accident report establishes that or he otherwise \nadmits to going ten miles per hour over the speed limit, Haley does not have to prove that Harvey has \nbreached a duty of due care. She will only have to prove that the speeding was an actual and proximate \ncause of the collision and will also have to prove the extent of the resulting damages to her. \n \nCausation: Actual Cause and Proximate Cause \n“For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost,” as the old saying has it. Virtually any cause of an injury can be \ntraced to some preceding cause. The problem for the law is to know when to draw the line between causes \nthat are immediate and causes too remote for liability reasonably to be assigned to them. In tort theory, \nthere are two kinds of causes that a plaintiff must prove: actual cause and proximate \ncause. Actual cause (causation in fact) can be found if the connection between the defendant’s act \nand the plaintiff’s injuries passes the “but for” test: if an injury would not have occurred “but for” the \ndefendant’s conduct, then the defendant is the cause of the injury. Still, this is not enough causation to \ncreate liability. The injuries to the plaintiff must also be foreseeable, or not “too remote,” for the \ndefendant’s act to create liability. This is proximate cause: a cause that is not too remote or \nunforseeable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n301 \nSuppose that the person who was injured was not one whom a reasonable person could have expected to \nbe harmed. Such a situation was presented in one of the most famous US tort cases, Palsgraf v. Long \nIsland Railroad (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"), which was decided by Judge Benjamin Cardozo. Although Judge \nCardozo persuaded four of his seven brethren to side with his position, the closeness of the case \ndemonstrates the difficulty that unforeseeable consequences and unforeseeable plaintiffs present. \n \nDamages \nFor a plaintiff to win a tort case, she must allege and prove that she was injured. The fear that she might \nbe injured in the future is not a sufficient basis for a suit. This rule has proved troublesome in medical \nmalpractice and industrial disease cases. A doctor’s negligent act or a company’s negligent exposure of a \nworker to some form of contamination might not become manifest in the body for years. In the meantime, \nthe tort statute of limitations might have run out, barring the victim from suing at all. An increasing \nnumber of courts have eased the plaintiff’s predicament by ruling that the statute of limitations does not \nbegin to run until the victim discovers that she has been injured or contracted a disease. \n \nThe law allows an exception to the general rule that damages must be shown when the plaintiff stands in \ndanger of immediate injury from a hazardous activity. If you discover your neighbor experimenting with \nexplosives in his basement, you could bring suit to enjoin him from further experimentation, even though \nhe has not yet blown up his house—and yours.",

City & County of Denver, 726 P.2d 1125 (Colo. 1986), we set forth several factors to \nbe considered in determining the existence of duty in a particular case: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n315 \nWhether the law should impose a duty requires consideration of many factors including, for \nexample, the risk involved, the foreseeability and likelihood of injury as weighed against the \nsocial utility of the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against injury or \nharm, and the consequences of placing the burden upon the actor. \n \n…A court’s conclusion that a duty does or does not exist is “an expression of the sum total of those \nconsiderations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is [or is not] entitled to protection.” \n… \nWe believe that the fact that the University is charged with negligent failure to act rather than negligent \naffirmative action is a critical factor that strongly militates against imposition of a duty on the University \nunder the facts of this case. In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the \nlaw has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active \nmisconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps \nto protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373. Liability for nonfeasance was slow to \nreceive recognition in the law. “The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by \n‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has \nat least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his \naffairs.” Id. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) summarizes the law on this point as follows: \n \nThe fact that an actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s \naid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action. \n \nImposition of a duty in all such cases would simply not meet the test of fairness under contemporary \nstandards. \n \nIn nonfeasance cases the existence of a duty has been recognized only during the last century in situations \ninvolving a limited group of special relationships between parties. Such special relationships are \npredicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies \nthe imposition of a duty to act.” W. Keeton, § 56, at 374.

We conclude from this record that the University’s very limited actions concerning safety of \nstudent recreation did not give Whitlock or the other members of campus fraternities or sororities any \nreason to depend upon the University for evaluation of the safety of trampoline use.…Therefore, we \nconclude that the student-university relationship is not a special relationship of the type giving rise to a \nduty of the University to take reasonable measures to protect the members of fraternities and sororities \nfrom risks of engaging in extra-curricular trampoline jumping. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n318 \n \nThe plaintiff asserts, however, that we should recognize a duty of the University to take affirmative action \nto protect fraternity members because of the foreseeability of the injury, the extent of the risks involved in \ntrampoline use, the seriousness of potential injuries, and the University’s superior knowledge concerning \nthese matters. The argument in essence is that a duty should spring from the University’s natural interest \nin the welfare and safety of its students, its superior knowledge of the nature and degree of risk involved \nin trampoline use, and its knowledge of the use of trampolines on the University campus. The evidence \namply supports a conclusion that trampoline use involves risks of serious injuries and that the potential \nfor an injury such as that experienced by Whitlock was foreseeable. It shows further that prior injuries \nresulting from trampoline accidents had been reported to campus security and to the student clinic, and \nthat University administrators were aware of the number and severity of trampoline injuries nationwide. \n \nThe record, however, also establishes through Whitlock’s own testimony that he was aware of the risk of \nan accident and injury of the very nature that he experienced.… \n \nWe conclude that the relationship between the University and Whitlock was not one of dependence with \nrespect to the activities at issue here, and provides no basis for the recognition of a duty of the University \nto take measures for protection of Whitlock against the injury that he suffered. \n \nB. \nWe next examine the lease between the University and the fraternity to determine whether a special \nrelationship between the University and Whitlock can be predicated on that document. The lease was \nexecuted in 1929, extends for a ninety-nine year term, and gives the fraternity the option to extend the \nterm for another ninety-nine years. The premises are to be occupied and used by the fraternity “as a \nfraternity house, clubhouse, dormitory and boarding house, and generally for religious, educational, social \nand fraternal purposes.” Such occupation is to be “under control of the tenant.” (emphasis added) The \nannual rental at all times relevant to this case appears from the record to be one dollar. The University has \nthe obligation to maintain the grounds and make necessary repairs to the building, and the fraternity is to \nbear the cost of such maintenance and repair. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n319 \n \n… \n \nWe conclude that the lease, and the University’s actions pursuant to its rights under the lease, provide no \nbasis of dependence by the fraternity members upon which a special relationship can be found to exist \nbetween the University and the fraternity members that would give rise to a duty upon the University to \ntake affirmative action to assure that recreational equipment such as a trampoline is not used under \nunsafe conditions. \n \nIV. \nConsidering all of the factors presented, we are persuaded that under the facts of this case the University \nof Denver had no duty to Whitlock to eliminate the private use of trampolines on its campus or to \nsupervise that use. There exists no special relationship between the parties that justifies placing a duty \nupon the University to protect Whitlock from the well-known dangers of using a trampoline. Here, a \nconclusion that a special relationship existed between Whitlock and the University sufficient to warrant \nthe imposition of liability for nonfeasance would directly contravene the competing social policy of \nfostering an educational environment of student autonomy and independence. \n \nWe reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and return this case to that court with directions to \nremand it to the trial court for dismissal of Whitlock’s complaint against the University. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a \nnineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law. As he \nput it: \n \n(F)rom a condition of society in which all the relations of Persons are summed up in the relations \nof Family, we seem to have steadily moved towards a phase of social order in which all these \nrelations arise from the free agreement of Individuals. . . . Thus the status of the Slave has \ndisappeared—it has been superseded by the contractual relation of the servant to his master. . . . \nThe status of the Female under Tutelage . . . has also ceased to exist. . . . So too the status of the \nSon under Power has no true place in the law of modern European societies. If any civil \nobligation binds together the Parent and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives \nits legal validity.... If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to \nsignify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we \nmay say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from \nStatus to Contract. [1] \n \nThis movement was not accidental. It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the \nfifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy \nwith all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, \ncommercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n330 \nContract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan. It was a response to \nchanging conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted, preferring the quieter, imagined \npastoral life of their forefathers. Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, \ndid a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with modem capitalism. \n \nContract Defined \nAs usual in the law, the legal definition of “contract” is formalistic. The Restatement says: “A contract is \na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which \nthe law in some way recognizes as a duty.” (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 1) Similarly, the \nUniform Commercial Code says: “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the \nparties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.” (Section 1-201(11)) A \nshort-hand definition is: “A contract is a legally enforceable promise.” \n \nEconomic View of Contract Law \nIn An Economic Analysis of Law (1973), Judge Richard A. Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading",

In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform. Responding to this development the American Law Institute \nestablished a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code. Various subcommittees \nwent to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published. Twelve more states adopted \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n333 \nthe code, eleven of them the 1962 text. By 1966, only three states and two territories had failed to enact \nany version: Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Guam, and Puerto Rico. \n \nMeanwhile, non-uniform provisions continued to be enacted in various states, particularly in Article 9, to \nwhich 337 such amendments had been made. In 1971, a redraft of that article was readied and the 1972 \nOfficial Text was published. By that time, Louisiana was the only holdout. Two years later, in 1974, \nLouisiana made the UCC a truly national law when it enacted some but not all of the 1972 text \n(significantly, Louisiana has not adopted Article 2). One more major change was made, a revision of \nArticle 8, necessitated by the electronics revolution that led to new ways of transferring investment \nsecurities from seller to purchaser. This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity. A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on. However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet \nof one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods. The Code deals with phases of this \ntransaction from start to finish. These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: \n \n• \nSales (Article 2) \n• \nCommercial Paper (Article 3) \n• \nBank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) \n• \nLetters of Credit (Article 5) \n• \nBulk Transfers (Article 6) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n334 \n• \nWarehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) \n• \nInvestment Securities (Article 8) \n• \nSecured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) \n \nWe now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction. \nSales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined \n(Section 2-105) in part as “all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for \nsale other than the money in which the price is to be paid. . . .” The only contracts and agreements covered \nby Article 2 are those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \n \nIn certain cases, the courts have difficulty in determining the nature of the object of a sales contract. The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of \ngoods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only \nincidentally used, with Newmark v. Gimbel’s Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), in which the court said “[i]f \nthe permanent wave lotion were sold … for home consumption . . . unquestionably an implied warranty of \nfitness for that purpose would have been an integral incident of the sale.” The New Jersey court rejected \nthe defendant’s argument that by actually applying the lotion to the patron’s head the salon lessened the \nliability it otherwise would have had if it had simply sold her the lotion. \n \nIn two areas, state legislatures have taken the goods vs. services issue out of the courts’ hands and",

Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement. For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car. Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you.",

The \nanswer to the first question is not always obvious; the range of factors that must be taken into account can \nbe large and their relationship subtle.

Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting. In the third example, \nwhat might appear to be such a promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou \ncome to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift. Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book. \n \nThere is a widely recognized exception to the requirement of consideration. In cases of promissory \nestoppel, the courts will enforce promises without consideration. Simply \nstated, promissory estoppel means that the courts will stop the promisor from claiming that there was \nno consideration. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is invoked in the interests of justice when three \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n345 \nconditions are met: (1) the promise is one that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce the \npromisee to take action or forbear from taking action of a definite and substantial character; (2) the action \nor forbearance is taken; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise. \nTimko served on the board of trustees of a school. He recommended that the school purchase a building \nfor a substantial sum of money, and to induce the trustees to vote for the purchase, he promised to help \nwith the purchase and to pay at the end of five years the purchase price less the down payment. At the end \nof four years, Timko died. The school sued his estate, which defended on the ground that there was no \nconsideration for the promise. Timko was promised or given nothing in return, and the purchase of the \nbuilding was of no direct benefit to him (which would have made the promise enforceable as a unilateral \ncontract). The court ruled that under the three-pronged promissory estoppel test, Timko’s estate was \nliable. [3] \n \nIllegality \nIn general, illegal contracts are unenforceable. The courts must grapple with two types of illegalities: (1) \nstatutory violations (e.g., the practice of law by a non-lawyer is forbidden by statute), and (2) violations of \npublic policy not expressly declared unlawful by statute, but so declared by the courts. \n \nCapacity \nA contract is a meeting of minds. If someone lacks mental capacity to understand what he is assenting \nto—or that he is assenting to anything—it is unreasonable to hold him to the consequences of his act. \n \nThe general rule is that persons younger than eighteen can avoid their contracts. Although the age of \nmajority was lowered in most states during the 1970s to correspond to the Twenty-sixth Amendment \n(ratified in 1971, guaranteeing the right to vote at eighteen), some states still put the age of majority at \ntwenty-one. Legal rights for those under twenty-one remain ambiguous, however. Although eighteen-\nyear-olds may assent to binding contracts, not all creditors and landlords believe it, and they may require \nparents to cosign. For those under twenty-one, there are also legal impediments to holding certain kinds \nof jobs, signing certain kinds of contracts, marrying, leaving home, and drinking alcohol.

Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of \ncontract. \n \nSpecific Performance \nSpecific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which \nhe obligated himself in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be \nissued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is seeking \nenforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from \ndoing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate \nremedy.)

These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant. Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v. Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from",

            "chunk": "the Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v. Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from \ncoverage accidents involving employees of the insureds. General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. \nPro Golf Association [3] involved such a situation. The insurance policy in question covered members of \nthe Professional Golfers Association. Gerald Hall, a golf pro employed by the local park department, was \nafforded coverage under the policy, which excluded “bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising \nout of and in the course of his employment by the insured.” That is, no employee of Hall’s would be \ncovered (rather, any such person would have coverage under workers’ compensation statutes). Bradley \nMartin, age thirteen, was at the golf course for junior league play. At Hall’s request, he agreed to retrieve \nor “shag” golf balls to be hit during a lesson Hall was giving; he was—as Hall put it—to be compensated \n“either through golf instructions or money or hotdogs or whatever.” During the course of the lesson, a golf \nball hit by Hall hit young Martin in the eye. If Martin was an employee, the insurance company would be \nliable; if he was not an employee, the insurance company would not liable. The trial court determined he \nwas not an employee. The evidence showed: sometimes the boys who “shagged” balls got paid, got golfing \ninstructions, or got food, so the question of compensation was ambiguous. Martin was not directed in how \nto perform (the admittedly simple) task of retrieving golf balls, no control was exercised over him, and no \nequipment was required other than a bag to collect the balls: “We believe the evidence is susceptible of \ndifferent inferences.…We cannot say that the decision of the trial court is against the manifest weight of \nthe evidence.” \n \nCreation of the Agency Relationship \nThe agency relationship can be created in two ways: by agreement (expressly) or by operation of law \n(constructively or impliedly). \n \n \nAgency Created by Agreement \nMost agencies are created by contract. Thus the general rules of contract law covered in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" govern the law of agency. But agencies can also be created without contract, by agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n379 \nTherefore, three contract principles are especially important: the first is the requirement for \nconsideration, the second for a writing, and the third concerns contractual capacity. \n \nConsideration \nAgencies created by consent—agreement—are not necessarily contractual. It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent.

There are, however, a few situations in which \nthe capacity of the agent is important. Thus a mentally incompetent agent cannot bind a principal. \n \nAgency Created by Operation of Law \nMost agencies are made by contract, but agency also may arise impliedly or apparently. \n \nImplied Agency \nIn areas of social need, courts have declared an agency to exist in the absence of an agreement. The agency \nrelationship then is said to have been implied “by operation of law.” Children in most states may purchase \nnecessary items—food or medical services—on the parent’s account. Long-standing social policy deems it \ndesirable for the head of a family to support his dependents, and the courts will put the expense on the \nfamily head in order to provide for the dependents’ welfare. The courts achieve this result by supposing \nthe dependent to be the family head’s agent, thus allowing creditors to sue the family head for the debt. \n \nImplied agencies also arise where one person behaves as an agent would and the “principal,” knowing that \nthe “agent” is behaving so, acquiesces, allowing the person to hold himself out as an agent. Such are the \nbasic facts in Weingart v. Directoire Restaurant, Inc. in Section 9.3.1 \"Creation of Agency: Liability of \nParent for Contracts Made by “Agent” Child\". \n \nApparent Agency \nSuppose Arthur is Paul’s agent, employed through October 31. On November 1, Arthur buys materials at \nLumber Yard—as he has been doing since early spring—and charges them to Paul’s account. Lumber Yard, \nnot knowing that Arthur’s employment terminated the day before, bills Paul. Will Paul have to pay? Yes, \nbecause the termination of the agency was not communicated to Lumber Yard. It appeared that Arthur \nwas an authorized agent. This issue is discussed further in Chapter 10 \"Liability of Principal and Agent; \nTermination of Agency\". \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n381 \nAn agent is one who acts on behalf of another. Many transactions are conducted by agents so acting. All \ncorporate transactions, including those involving governmental organizations, are so conducted because \ncorporations cannot themselves actually act; they are legal fictions. Agencies may be created expressly, \nimpliedly, or apparently. Recurring issues in agency law include whether the “agent” really is such, the scope \nof the agent’s authority, and the duties among the parties. The five types of agents include: general agent, \nspecial agent, subagent, agency coupled with an interest, and servant (or employee). The independent \ncontractor is not an employee; her activities are not specifically controlled by her client, and the client is not \nliable for payroll taxes, Social Security, and the like. But it is not uncommon for an employer to claim workers \nare independent contractors when in fact they are employees, and the cases are often hard-fought on the \nfacts. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is agency law especially important in the business and government context? \n2. What are the five types of agents? \n3. What distinguishes an employee from an independent contractor? \n4. Why do employers frequently try to pass off employees as independent contractors? \n \n  \n \n[1] 1. Flick v. Crouch, 434 P.2d 256, 260 (OK, 1967). \n[2] Robinson v.

But these general duties are not unique to agency law; they are duties owed by any \nemployee to the employer. \n \nFiduciary Duty \nIn a nonagency contractual situation, the parties’ responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. \nThere is no relationship beyond the agreement.

These inventions were developed in the company’s plants at its expense. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n386 \nWhen Sharp died, his family claimed the rights to the inventions on which Sharp held assignments and \nsued the company, which used the inventions, for patent infringement. The family reasoned that after the \nexpiration of the employment contract, Sharp was employed only in a managerial capacity, not as an \ninventor. The court disagreed and invoked the shop rights doctrine, under which an invention \n“developed and perfected in [a company’s] plant with its time, materials, and appliances, and wholly at its \nexpense” may be used by the company without payment of royalties: “Because the servant uses his \nmaster’s time, facilities and materials to attain a concrete result, the employer is entitled to use that which \nembodies his own property and to duplicate it as often as he may find occasion to employ similar \nappliances in his business.” The company would have been given complete ownership of the patents had \nthere been an express or implied (e.g., the employee is hired to make inventions) contract to this effect \nbetween Sharp and the company. \n \nPrincipal’s Duty to Agent \nIn this category, we may note that the principal owes the agent duties in contract, tort, and—statutorily—\nworkers’ compensation law. \n \nContract Duties \nThe fiduciary relationship of agent to principal does not run in reverse—that is, the principal is not the \nagent’s fiduciary. Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his \nagent. \n \nGeneral Contract Duties \nThese duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal \nhas a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” [5] The principal is allowed, \nhowever, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty \nto inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of \nassigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may \nbe dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject \nthe principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n387 \nprincipal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends \non a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, \nand the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, \nand so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it. \n \nEmployment at Will \nUnder the traditional “employment-at-will” doctrine, an employee who is not hired for a specific period \ncan be fired at any time, for any reason (except bad reasons: an employee cannot be fired, for example, for \nreporting that his employer’s paper mill is illegally polluting groundwater). This doctrine has been much \ncriticized. \n \nDuty to Indemnify \nAgents commonly spend money pursuing the principal’s business. Unless the agreement explicitly \nprovides otherwise, the principal has a duty to indemnify or reimburse the agent. A familiar form of \nindemnity is the employee expense account. \n \nTort and Workers’ Compensation Duties \nThe employer owes the employee—any employee, not just agents—certain statutorily imposed tort and \nworkers’ compensation duties. \n \nBackground to Workers’ Compensation \nAndy, who works in a dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong shed. Andy warns his \nfellow employee Bill that he has done so. Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands on \nthe ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At \ncommon law, the answer would be no—three times no. First, the “fellow-servant” rule would bar recovery \nbecause the employer was held not to be responsible for torts committed by one employee against \nanother. Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the dynamite had been negligently stored by the \nemployer rather than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been dismissed. Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

In large numbers of cases, workers who were mutilated or killed on the job found themselves and \ntheir families without recompense. Union pressure and grass roots lobbying led to \nworkers’ compensation acts—statutory enactments that dramatically overhauled the law of torts as it \naffected employees. \n \n \nThe System in General \nWorkers’ compensation is a no-fault system. The employee gives up the right to sue the employer (and, in \nsome states, other employees) and receives in exchange predetermined compensation for a job-related \ninjury, regardless of who caused it. This trade-off was felt to be equitable to employer and employee: the \nemployee loses the right to seek damages for pain and suffering—which can be a sizable portion of any \njury award—but in return he can avoid the time-consuming and uncertain judicial process and assure \nhimself that his medical costs and a portion of his salary will be paid—and paid promptly. The employer \nmust pay for all injuries, even those for which he is blameless, but in return he avoids the risk of losing a \nbig lawsuit, can calculate his costs actuarially, and can spread the risks through insurance. \n \nMost workers’ compensation acts provide 100 percent of the cost of a worker’s hospitalization and \nmedical care necessary to cure the injury and relieve him from its effects. They also provide for payment \nof lost wages and death benefits. Even an employee who is able to work may be eligible to receive \ncompensation for specific injuries.

In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event \nthe employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old \ncommon-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been \nstatutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is \ntherefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage. \n \nThose frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and public employees; public employees, \nfederal workers, and railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but similar laws. The \ntrend has been to include more and more classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide \ncoverage for household workers, although the threshold of coverage varies widely from state to state. \nSome use an earnings test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall within the domestic \ncategory include maids, baby-sitters, gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers, electricians, \nand other independent contractors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n391 \n \nPaying for Workers’ Compensation \nThere are three general methods by which employers may comply with workers’ compensation laws. First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31. [6] \n \nRecurring Legal Issues \nThere are a number of legal issues that recur in workers’ compensation cases. The problem is, from the \nemployer’s point of view, that the cost of buying insurance is tied to the number of claims made. The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation.

In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event the employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old common-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been statutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is therefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage."

We just let it hang and I told this Buster, \nBuster was his name, that you are a free agent and you do whatever you want to do. I am \ntending bar in the place and what you do in the street is up to you, I will not stop you, but we are \nnot hiring you or anything like that, because at that time, we didn’t know what we were going to \nuse the parking lot or get a doorman and put on a uniform or what. \n \nThese facts establish to the court’s satisfaction that, although Douglas was not an actual employee of the \nrestaurant, defendant held him out as its authorized agent or “employee” for the purpose of parking its \ncustomers’ cars, by expressly consenting to his standing, in uniform, in front of its door to receive \ncustomers, to park their cars and issue receipts therefor—which services were rendered without charge to \nthe restaurant’s customers, except for any gratuity paid to Douglas. Clearly, under these circumstances, \napparent authority has been shown and Douglas acted within the scope of this authority. \n \nPlaintiff was justified in assuming that Douglas represented the restaurant in providing his services and \nthat the restaurant had placed him there for the convenience of its customers. A restaurateur knows that \nthis is the impression created by allowing a uniformed attendant to so act. Facility in parking is often a \ncritical consideration for a motorist in selecting a restaurant in midtown Manhattan, and the Directoire \nwas keenly aware of this fact as evidenced by its testimony that the management was looking into various \nother possibilities for solving customers’ parking problems. \n \nThere was no suitable disclaimer posted outside the restaurant that it had no parking facilities or that \nentrusting one’s car to any person was at the driver’s risk. It is doubtful that any prudent driver would \nentrust his car to a strange person on the street, if he thought that the individual had no authorization \nfrom the restaurant or club or had no connection with it, but was merely an independent operator with \nquestionable financial responsibility. \n \nThe fact that Douglas received no compensation directly from defendant is not material. Each party \nderived a benefit from the arrangement: Douglas being willing to work for gratuities from customers, and \nthe defendant, at no cost to itself, presenting the appearance of providing the convenience of free parking \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n397 \nand doorman services to its patrons. In any case, whatever private arrangements existed between the \nrestaurant and Douglas were never disclosed to the customers. \n \nEven if such person did perform these services for several restaurants, it does not automatically follow \nthat he is a freelance entrepreneur, since a shared employee working for other small or moderately sized \nrestaurants in the area would seem a reasonable arrangement, in no way negating the authority of the \nattendant to act as doorman and receive cars for any one of these places individually. \n \nThe case most analogous to the instant one is Klotz v. El Morocco [Citation, 1968], and plaintiff here \nrelies on it. That case similarly involved the theft of a car parked by a uniformed individual standing in \nfront of defendant’s restaurant who, although not employed by it, parked vehicles for its patrons with the \nrestaurant’s knowledge and consent. Defendant here attempts to distinguish this case principally upon the \nground that the parties in El Morocco stipulated that the ‘doorman’ was an agent or employee of the \ndefendant acting within the scope of his authority. However, the judge made an express finding to that \neffect: ‘* * * there was sufficient evidence in plaintiff’s case on which to find DiGiovanni, the man in the \nuniform, was acting within the scope of his authority as agent of defendant.” Defendant here also points to \nthe fact that in Klotz DiGiovanni placed patrons’ car keys on a rack inside El Morocco; however, this is \nonly one fact to be considered in finding a bailment and is, to me, more relevant to the issue of the degree \nof care exercised. \n \nWhen defendant’s agent failed to produce plaintiff’s automobile, a presumption of negligence arose which \nnow requires defendant to come forward with a sufficient explanation to rebut this presumption. \n[Citation] The matter should be set down for trial on the issues of due care and of damages. \n \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n398 \n1.

The defendant argued that there were key differences between the two cases that made them different, such as the fact that the car-parking attendant in the Klotz case was found to be an employee of the restaurant, whereas Buster Douglas was not. The defendant also argued that the facts of the two cases were not identical, as the restaurant in the Klotz case had a different name and was located in a different city. Therefore, the defendant argued that the cases were not very similar and that the court should not rely on the Klotz case to determine the outcome of the current case."

All eight named \nplaintiffs signed [employment agreements] when first hired by Microsoft or soon thereafter. [One] \nincluded a provision that states that the undersigned “agrees to be responsible for all federal and state \ntaxes, withholding, social security, insurance and other benefits.” The [other one] states that “as an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n400 \nIndependent Contractor to Microsoft, you are self-employed and are responsible to pay all your own \ninsurance and benefits.” Eventually, the plaintiffs learned of the various benefits being provided to regular \nemployees from speaking with them or reading various Microsoft publications concerning employee \nbenefits. \n \nIn 1989 and 1990, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)[,]…applying common-law principles defining the \nemployer-employee relationship, concluded that Microsoft’s freelancers were not independent contractors \nbut employees for withholding and employment tax purposes, and that Microsoft would thereafter be \nrequired to pay withholding taxes and the employer’s portion of Federal Insurance Contribution Act \n(FICA) tax. Microsoft agreed.… \n \nAfter learning of the IRS rulings, the plaintiffs sought various employee benefits, including those now at \nissue: the ESPP and SPP benefits. The SPP…is a cash or deferred salary arrangement under § 401k of the \nInternal Revenue Code that permits Microsoft’s employees to save and invest up to fifteen percent of their \nincome through tax-deferred payroll deductions.…Microsoft matches fifty percent of the employee’s \ncontribution in any year, with [a maximum matching contribution]. The ESPP…permits employees to \npurchase company stock [with various rules]. \n \nMicrosoft rejected the plaintiffs’ claims for benefits, maintaining that they were independent contractors \nwho were personally responsible for all their own benefits.… \n \nThe plaintiffs brought this action, challenging the denial of benefits. \n \nMicrosoft contends that the extrinsic evidence, including the [employment agreements], demonstrates its \nintent not to provide freelancers or independent contractors with employee benefits[.]…We have no doubt \nthat the company did not intend to provide freelancers or independent contractors with employee \nbenefits, and that if the plaintiffs had in fact been freelancers or independent contractors, they would not \nbe eligible under the plan. The plaintiffs, however, were not freelancers or independent contractors. They \nwere common-law employees, and the question is what, if anything, Microsoft intended with respect to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n401 \npersons who were actually common-law employees but were not known to Microsoft to be such. The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status. Indeed, Microsoft has pointed to no \nevidence suggesting that it ever denied eligibility to any employees, whom it understood to be common-\nlaw employees, by paying them through the accounts receivable department or otherwise. \n \nWe therefore construe the ambiguity in the plan against Microsoft and hold that the plaintiffs are eligible \nto participate under the terms of the SPP. \n \n[Next, regarding the ESPP] we hold that the plaintiffs…are covered by the specific provisions of the ESPP. \nWe apply the “objective manifestation theory of contracts,” which requires us to “impute an intention \ncorresponding to the reasonable meaning of a person’s words and acts.” [Citation] Through its \nincorporation of the tax code provision into the plan, Microsoft manifested an objective intent to make all \ncommon-law employees, and hence the plaintiffs, eligible for participation.

(emphasis added) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n402 \n \n[T]he ESPP, when construed in a manner consistent with the requirements of § 423, extends participation \nto all common-law employees not covered by one of the express exceptions set forth in the plan. \nAccordingly, we find that the ESPP, through its incorporation of § 423, expressly extends eligibility for \nparticipation to the plaintiff class and affords them the same options to acquire stock in the corporation as \nall other employees. \n \nMicrosoft next contends that the [employment agreements] signed by the plaintiffs render them ineligible \nto participate in the ESPP. First, the label used in the instruments signed by the plaintiffs does not control \ntheir employment status. Second, the employment instruments, if construed to exclude the plaintiffs from \nreceiving ESPP benefits, would conflict with the plan’s express incorporation of § 423. Although Microsoft \nmay have generally intended to exclude individuals who were in fact independent contractors, it could \nnot, consistent with its express intention to extend participation in the ESPP to all common-law \nemployees, have excluded the plaintiffs. Indeed, such an exclusion would defeat the purpose of including § \n423 in the plan, because the exclusion of common-law employees not otherwise accepted would result in \nthe loss of the plan’s tax qualification. \n \nFinally, Microsoft maintains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to ESPP benefits because the terms of the \nplan were never communicated to them and they were therefore unaware of its provisions when they \nperformed their employment services.…In any event, to the extent that knowledge of an offer of benefits is \na prerequisite, it is probably sufficient that Microsoft publicly promulgated the plan. In [Citation], the \nplaintiff was unaware of the company’s severance plan until shortly before his termination. The Oklahoma \nSupreme Court concluded nonetheless that publication of the plan was “the equivalent of constructive \nknowledge on the part of all employees not specifically excluded.” \n \nWe are not required to rely, however, on the [this] analysis or even on Microsoft’s own unwitting \nconcession. There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights. It is “well established” that an optionor may not rely on an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n403 \noptionee’s failure to exercise an option when he has committed any act or failed to perform any duty \n“calculated to cause the optionee to delay in exercising the right.” [Citation] “[T]he optionor may not \nmake statements or representations calculated to cause delay, [or] fail to furnish [necessary] \ninformation.…” Similarly, “[I]t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause \nof the failure of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own \nliability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.” [Citation]… \n \nApplying these principles, we agree with the magistrate judge, who concluded that Microsoft, which \ncreated a benefit to which the plaintiffs were entitled, could not defend itself by arguing that the plaintiffs \nwere unaware of the benefit, when its own false representations precluded them from gaining that \nknowledge. Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer. It may not now take advantage of that failure to defeat the plaintiffs’ rights to ESPP \nbenefits. Thus, we reject Microsoft’s final argument. \n \nConclusion \nFor the reasons stated, the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Microsoft and denial of \nsummary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for the \ndetermination of any questions of individual eligibility for benefits that may remain following issuance of",

Know that the principal may also be liable—even if the agent had no authority—if the principal ratifies the \nagent’s contract after the fact. \n \n \nPrincipal’s Contract Liability Requires That Agent Had Authority \nThe key to determining whether a principal is liable for contracts made by his agent is authority: was the \nagent authorized to negotiate the agreement and close the deal? Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority \nThe strongest form of authority is that which is expressly granted, often in written form. The principal \nconsents to the agent’s actions, and the third party may then rely on the document attesting to the agent’s \nauthority to deal on behalf of the principal. One common form of express authority is the standard \nsignature card on file with banks allowing corporate agents to write checks on the company’s credit. The \nprincipal bears the risk of any wrongful action of his agent, as demonstrated in Allen A. Funt Productions, \nInc. v. Chemical Bank. [1] Allen A. Funt submitted to his bank through his production company various \ncertificates permitting his accountant to use the company’s checking accounts. [2] In fact, for several years \nthe accountant embezzled money from the company by writing checks to himself and depositing them in \nhis own account. The company sued its bank, charging it with negligence, apparently for failing to monitor \nthe amount of money taken by the accountant. But the court dismissed the negligence complaint, citing a \nstate statute based on the common-law agency principle that a third party is entitled to rely on the express \nauthorization given to an agent; in this case, the accountant drew checks on the account within the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n418 \nmonetary limits contained in the signature cards on file with the bank. Letters of introduction and work \norders are other types of express authority. \n \nFigure 10.1 Types of Authority \n \n \nImplied Authority \nNot every detail of an agent’s work can be spelled out. It is impossible to delineate step-by-step the duties \nof a general agent; at best, a principal can set forth only the general nature of the duties that the agent is \nto perform. Even a special agent’s duties are difficult to describe in such detail as to leave him without \ndiscretion. If express authority were the only valid kind, there would be no efficient way to use an agent, \nboth because the effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the third party would be \nreluctant to deal with him. \nBut the law permits authority to be “implied” by the relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of \nthe business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question, the wording of the agency contract, and \nthe knowledge that the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it. In \neither event, the business manager has a relatively large domain of implied authority. He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business. The full extent of the manager’s authority \ndepends on the circumstances—what is customary in the particular industry, in the particular business, \nand among the individuals directly concerned. \n \nOn the other hand, a manager does not have implicit authority to undertake unusual or extraordinary \nactions on behalf of his principal. In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises.

Andy has no implied authority to change the name or to commission \nthe artist, though he does have implied authority to engage a printer to replenish the stationery supply—\nand possibly to make some design changes in the letterhead. \n \nEven when there is no implied authority, in an emergency the agent may act in ways that would in the \nnormal course require specific permission from the principal. If unforeseen circumstances arise and it is \nimpracticable to communicate with the principal to find out what his wishes would be, the agent may do \nwhat is reasonably necessary in order to prevent substantial loss to his principal. During World War II, \nEastern Wine Corporation marketed champagne in a bottle with a diagonal red stripe that infringed the \ntrademark of a French producer. The French company had granted licenses to an American importer to \nmarket its champagne in the United States. The contract between producer and importer required the \nlatter to notify the French company whenever a competitor appeared to be infringing its rights and to \nrecommend steps by which the company could stop the infringement. The authority to institute suit was \nnot expressly conferred, and ordinarily the right to do so would not be inferred. Because France was under \nGerman occupation, however, the importer was unable to communicate with the producer, its principal. \nThe court held that the importer could file suit to enjoin Eastern Wine from continuing to display the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n420 \ninfringing red diagonal stripe, since legal action was “essential to the preservation of the principal’s \nproperty.” [3] \n \nThe rule that a person’s position can carry with it implied authority is fundamental to American business \npractice. But outside the United States this rule is not applicable, and the business executive traveling \nabroad should be aware that in civil-law countries it is customary to present proof of authority to transact \ncorporate business—usually in the form of a power of attorney. This is not always an easy task. Not only \nmust the power of the traveling executive be shown but the right of the corporate officer back in the \nUnited States to delegate authority must also be proven. \n \nApparent Authority \nIn the agency relationship, the agent’s actions in dealing with third parties will affect the legal rights of the \nprincipal. What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel. Estoppel is the doctrine \nthat a person will not now be allowed to deny a promise or assertion she previously made where there has \nbeen detrimental reliance on that promise or assertion. Estoppel is commonly used to avoid injustice.

Understand in what circumstances a principal will be vicariously liable for torts committed by employees. \n2. Recognize the difference between agents whose tort and criminal liability may be imputed to the employer \nand those whose liability will not be so imputed. \n3. Know when the principal will be vicariously liable for intentional torts committed by the agent. \n4. Explain what is meant by “the scope of employment,” within which the agent’s actions may be attributed to \nthe principal and without which they will not. \n5. Name special cases of vicarious liability. \n6. Describe the principal’s liability for crimes committed by the agent. \n \n \n \nPrincipal’s Tort Liability \nThe Distinction between Direct and Vicarious Liability \nWhen is the principal liable for injuries that the agent causes another to suffer? \n \nDirect Liability \nThere is a distinction between torts prompted by the principal himself and torts of which the principal \nwas innocent. If the principal directed the agent to commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the \nagent’s carrying out his instructions would bring harm to someone, the principal is liable. This is an \napplication of the general common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by delegating an \nunlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls \nthe trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in his use of agents will be held liable for their \nnegligence. This rule comes into play when the principal fails to supervise employees adequately, gives \nfaulty directions, or hires incompetent or unsuitable people for a particular job. Imposing liability on the \nprincipal in these cases is readily justifiable since it is the principal’s own conduct that is the underlying \nfault; the principal here is directly liable. \n \nVicarious Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n424 \nBut the principle of liability for one’s agent is much broader, extending to acts of which the principal had \nno knowledge, that he had no intention to commit nor involvement in, and that he may in fact have \nexpressly prohibited the agent from engaging in. This is the principle of respondeat superior (“let the \nmaster answer”) or the master-servant doctrine, which imposes on the \nprincipal vicarious liability (vicarious means “indirectly, as, by, or through a substitute”) under which \nthe principal is responsible for acts committed by the agent within the scope of the employment \n(see Figure 10.2 \"Principal’s Tort Liability\"). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10.2 Principal’s Tort Liability \n \n \nThe modern basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed the “deep pocket” theory: the principal \n(usually a corporation) has deeper pockets than the agent, meaning that it has the wherewithal to pay for \nthe injuries traceable one way or another to events it set in motion. A million-dollar industrial accident is \nwithin the means of a company or its insurer; it is usually not within the means of the agent—employee—\nwho caused it. \n \nThe “deep pocket” of the defendant-company is not always very deep, however. For many small \nbusinesses, in fact, the principle of respondeat superior is one of life or death. One example was the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n425 \nclosing in San Francisco of the much-beloved Larraburu Brothers Bakery—at the time, the world’s second \nlargest sourdough bread maker. The bakery was held liable for $2 million in damages after one of its \ndelivery trucks injured a six-year-old boy. The bakery’s insurance policy had a limit of $1.25 million, and \nthe bakery could not absorb the excess. The Larraburus had no choice but to cease operations. \n(Seehttp://www.outsidelands.org/larraburu.php.) \n \nRespondeat superior raises three difficult questions: (1) What type of agents can create tort liability for \nthe principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked.

                    "answer": "There are two types of agents whose tort and criminal liability may be imputed to the employer. The first type of agent is a servant, who is an employee who is subject to the control of the principal. The second type of agent is an independent contractor, who is a person who contracts to do a piece of work according to his or her own methods, without being subject to the control of the principal, except as to the results of the work. The liability of the employer for the torts of a servant is based on the doctrine of respondeat superior, which holds the employer liable for the torts of the servant committed within the scope of employment. The liability of the employer for the torts of an independent contractor is based on the doctrine of vicarious liability, which holds the employer liable for the torts of the independent contractor committed within the scope of employment."

The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply. If a hungry deliveryman stops at a restaurant outside the normal \nlunch hour, intending to continue to his next delivery after eating, he is within the scope of employment. \nBut suppose he decides to take the truck home that evening, in violation of rules, in order to get an early \nstart the next morning. Suppose he decides to stop by the beach, which is far away from his route. Does it \nmake a difference if the employer knows that his deliverymen do this? \n \nThe Zone of Risk Test \nCourt decisions in the last forty years have moved toward a different standard, one that looks to the \nforeseeability of the agent’s conduct. By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for \nvicarious liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be, doing—more or less—what she is \nsupposed to be doing, and the incident arose from the employee’s pursuit of the employer’s interest \n(again, more or less). That is, the employer is within the zone of risk if the servant is in the place within \nwhich, if the master were to send out a search party to find a missing employee, it would be reasonable to \nlook. See Section 4, Cockrell v. Pearl River Valley Water Supply Dist. \n \nSpecial Cases of Vicarious Liability \nVicarious liability is not limited to harm caused in the course of an agency relationship. It may also be \nimposed in other areas, including torts of family members, and other torts governed by statute or \nregulation. We will examine each in turn. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n428 \n \nUse of Automobiles \nA problem commonly arises when an automobile owner lends his vehicle to a personal friend, someone \nwho is not an agent, and the borrower injures a third person. Is the owner liable? In many states, the \nowner is not liable; in other states, however, two approaches impose liability on the owner. \nThe first approach is legislative: owner’s consent statutes make the owner liable when the automobile \nis being driven with his consent or knowledge. The second approach to placing liability on the owner is \njudicial and known as the family purpose doctrine. Under this doctrine, a family member who \nnegligently injures someone with the car subjects the owner to liability if the family member was \nfurthering family purposes. These are loosely defined to include virtually every use to which a child, for \nexample, might put a car. In a Georgia case, Dixon v. Phillips, the father allowed his minor son to drive \nthe car but expressly forbade him from letting anyone else do so. [2] Nevertheless, the son gave the wheel \nto a friend and a collision occurred while both were in the car. The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction \n(to which Mr. Dickens’s Mr. Bumble responded, in the memorable line, “If the law supposes that, the law \nis a ass—a idiot” [4]). This ancient view has been abrogated by statute or by court ruling in all the states, so \nthat now a wife is solely responsible for her own torts unless she in fact serves as her husband’s agent. \n \nUnlike wives, children are not presumed at common law to be agents or extensions of the father so that \nnormally parents are not vicariously liable for their children’s torts. However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers. Thus the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n429 \nIllinois Parental Responsibility Law provides the following: “The parent or legal guardian of an \nunemancipated minor who resides with such parent or legal guardian is liable for actual damages for the",

The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal. Who may enforce the contracts against them? \n \nThe developer and the agents may sue to compel transfer of title. The undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal may act to enforce his rights unless the contract specifically prohibits it or there is a \nrepresentation that the signatories are not signing for an undisclosed principal. The agents may also bring \nsuit to enforce the principal’s contract rights because, as agents for an undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal, they are considered parties to their contracts. \n \nNow suppose the developer attempts to call off the deal. Whom may the sellers sue? Both the developer \nand the agents are liable. That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there \nwas a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may \nstill recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior \nto winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the \nplaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway. Similarly, if the \nseller sues the principal and recovers a judgment, the agents are relieved of liability. The seller thus has a \n“right of election” to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, a right that in many states may be \nexercised any time before the seller collects on the judgment. \n \n \nLack of Authority in Agent \nAn agent who purports to make a contract on behalf of a principal, but who in fact has no authority to do \nso, is liable to the other party. The theory is that the agent has warranted to the third party that he has the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n434 \nrequisite authority. The principal is not liable in the absence of apparent authority or ratification. But the \nagent does not warrant that the principal has capacity. Thus an agent for a minor is not liable on a \ncontract that the minor later disavows unless the agent expressly warranted that the principal had \nattained his majority. In short, the implied warranty is that the agent has authority to make a deal, not \nthat the principal will necessarily comply with the contract once the deal is made. \n \nAgent Acting on Own Account \nAn agent will be liable on contracts made in a personal capacity—for instance, when the agent personally \nguarantees repayment of a debt. The agent’s intention to be personally liable is often difficult to determine \non the basis of his signature on a contract. Generally, a person signing a contract can avoid personal \nliability only by showing that he was in fact signing as an agent. If the contract is signed “Jones, Agent,” \nJones can introduce evidence to show that there was never an intention to hold him personally liable. But \nif he signed “Jones” and neither his agency nor the principal’s name is included, he will be personally \nliable. This can be troublesome to agents who routinely indorse checks and notes. There are special rules \ngoverning these situations, which are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\" dealing with \ncommercial paper. \n \nTermination of Agency \nThe agency relationship is not permanent. Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the",

App. DC 1976) \n \nMcMillan, J.: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n441 \nCorene Antoinette Lyon, plaintiff, recovered a $33,000.00 verdict [about $142,000 in 2010 dollars] in the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia before Judge Barrington T. Parker and a jury, \nagainst the corporate defendants, George’s Radio and Television Company, Inc., and Pep Line Trucking \nCompany, Inc. The suit for damages arose out of an assault, including rape, committed with a knife and \nother weapons upon the plaintiff on May 9, 1972, by Michael Carey, a nineteen-year-old deliveryman for \nPep Line Trucking Company, Inc. Three months after the trial, Judge Parker set aside the verdict and \nrendered judgment for both defendants notwithstanding the verdict. Plaintiff appealed.… \n \nAlthough the assault was perhaps at the outer bounds of respondeat superior, the case was properly one \nfor the jury. Whether the assault in this case was the outgrowth of a job-related controversy or simply a \npersonal adventure of the deliveryman, was a question for the jury. This was the import of the trial judge’s \ninstructions. The verdict as to Pep Line should not have been disturbed. \nIrene Lyon bought a mattress and springs for her bed from the defendant George’s Radio and Television \nCompany, Inc. The merchandise was to be delivered on May 9, 1972. Irene Lyon had to be at work and the \nplaintiff [Irene’s sister] Corene Lyon, had agreed to wait in her sister’s apartment to receive the delivery. \n \nA C.O.D. balance of $13.24 was due on the merchandise, and Irene Lyon had left a check for $13.24 to \ncover that balance. Plaintiff had been requested by her sister to “wait until the mattress and the springs \ncame and to check and make sure they were okay.” \n \nPlaintiff, fully clothed, answered the door. Her description of what happened is sufficiently brief and \nunqualified that it will bear repeating in full. She testified, without objection, as follows: \n \nI went to the door, and I looked in the peephole, and I asked who was there. The young man told \nme he was a delivery man from George’s. He showed me a receipt, and it said, ‘George’s.’ He said \nhe [needed cash on delivery—COD], so I let him in, and I told him to bring the mattress upstairs \nand he said, ‘No,’ that he wasn’t going to lug them upstairs, and he wanted the COD first, and I \ntold him I wanted to see the mattress and box springs to make sure they were okay, and he said \nno, he wasn’t going to lug them upstairs [until he got the check]. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n442 \n \nSo this went back and forwards and so he was getting angry, and I told him to wait right here \nwhile I go get the COD. I went to the bedroom to get the check, and I picked it up, and I turned \naround and he was right there. \n \nAnd then I was giving him the check and then he told me that his boss told him not to accept a \ncheck, that he wanted cash money, and that if I didn’t give him cash money, he was going to take \nit on my ass, and he told me that he was no delivery man, he was a rapist and then he threw me \non the bed. \n \n[The Court] Talk louder, young lady, the jury can’t hear you. \n \n[The witness] And then he threw me on the bed, and he had a knife to my throat. \n \n[Plaintiff’s attorney] Then what happened? \n \nAnd then he raped me. \n \nPlaintiff’s pre-trial deposition was a part of the record on appeal, and it shows that Carey raped plaintiff at \nknife point; that then he chased her all over the apartment with a knife and scissors and cut plaintiff in \nnumerous places on her face and body, beat and otherwise attacked her. All of the physical injury other \nthan the rape occurred after rather than before the rape had been accomplished.… \n \n[Carey was convicted of rape and sent to prison. The court determined that George’s was properly \ndismissed because Pep Line, Carey’s employer, was an independent contractor over which George’s had \nno control.] \n \nThe principal question, therefore, is whether the evidence discloses any other basis upon which a jury \ncould reasonably find Pep Line, the employer of Carey, liable for the assault. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n443 \n \nMichael Carey was in the employment of the defendant Pep Line as a deliveryman.

The plaintiff, Munick, a Russian born Jew, testified that he went to the Durham, \nNorth Carolina city water company office on April 17, 1919, and offered to pay his bill with “three paper \ndollars, one silver dollar, and fifty cents in pennies.” The pennies were in a roll “like the bank fixes them.” \nThe clerk gave a receipt and the plaintiff prepared to leave the office. The office manager came into the \nroom, saw the clerk counting the pennies, became enraged at the situation, shoved the pennies onto the \nfloor and ordered Munick to pick them up. Bolton, the manager, “locked the front door and took me by \nthe jacket and called me ‘God damned Jew,’ and said, ‘I want only bills.’ I did not say anything and he hit \nme in the face. I did not resist, and the door was locked and I could not get out.…” With the door locked, \nBolton then repeatedly choked and beat the plaintiff, finally extracted a bill in place of the pennies, and \nordered him off the premises with injuries including finger marks on his neck that could be seen for eight \nor ten days. Bolton was convicted of unlawful assault [but the case against the water company was \ndismissed]. \n \nThe North Carolina Supreme Court (Clark, C. J.) reversed the trial court’s dismissal and held that the case \nshould have gone to the jury. The court…said [Citation]: \n \n“‘It is now fully established that corporations may be held liable for negligent and malicious torts, \nand that responsibility will be imputed whenever such wrongs are committed by their employees \nand agents in the course of their employment and within its scope * * * in many of the cases, and \nin reliable textbooks * * * ‘course of employment’ is stated and considered as sufficiently inclusive; \nbut, whether the one or the other descriptive term is used, they have the same significance in",

Additionally, the employer should have taken steps to ensure that the employee was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the assault.

As she was fixing her \nmakeup using the mirror on the sun visor, Officer James pulled his patrol car into a church parking lot \nand parked the car. He then pulled Cockrell towards him in an embrace and began stroking her back and \nhair telling her that things would be fine. Cockrell told Officer James to release her, but he continued to \nembrace her for approximately five minutes before continuing on to the jail. \n \nOn June 30, 1998, Cockrell returned to the Reservoir Patrol office to retrieve her driver’s license. Officer \nJames called Cockrell into his office and discussed her DUI charge with her. As she was leaving, Officer \nJames grabbed her from behind, turned her around, pinned both of her arms behind her and pulled her to \nhis chest. When Officer James bent down to kiss her, she ducked her head, thus causing Officer James to \ninstead kiss her forehead. When Officer James finally released Cockrell, she ran out of the door and drove \naway. [Subsequently, Cockrell’s attorney threatened civil suit against Patrol; James was fired in October \n1998.] \n \nOn September 22, 1999, Cockrell filed a complaint for damages against the District alleging that on the \nnights of June 28 and June 30, 1998, Officer James was acting within the course and scope of his \nemployment with the District and that he acted with reckless disregard for her emotional well-being and \nsafety.…On April 2, 2002, the District filed its motion for summary judgment alleging that there was no \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n449 \ngenuine issue of material fact regarding Cockrell’s claim of liability. The motion alleged that the conduct \ndescribed by Cockrell was outside the course and scope of Officer James’s public employment as he was \nintending to satisfy his lustful urges. Cockrell responded to the motion arguing that the misconduct did \noccur in the course and scope of Officer James’s employment with the District and also that the \nmisconduct did not reach the level of a criminal offense such that the District could be found not liable \nunder the MTCA. \n \nThe trial court entered a final judgment granting the District’s motion for summary judgment and \ndismissing the complaint with prejudice.

Cockrell argues Officer James’s conduct, although inappropriate, \ndid not rise to the level of criminal conduct. Cockrell contends Officer James’s action of hugging Cockrell \nwas similar to an officer consoling a victim of a crime. Cockrell does admit that Officer James’s action of \nkissing her is more difficult to view as within the course and scope of his employment… \n \nThe District argues that although Officer James acted within the course and scope of his duties when he \narrested Cockrell, his later conduct, which was intended to satisfy his lustful desires, was outside the \nscope of his employment with it.… \n \n“Mississippi law provides that an activity must be in furtherance of the employer’s business to be within \nthe scope and course of employment.” [Citation] To be within the course and scope of employment, an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n450 \nactivity must carry out the employer’s purpose of the employment or be in furtherance of the employer’s \nbusiness.

How can this case and Lyon v. Carey (Section 10.4.2 \"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: \nScope of Employment\") be reconciled? Both involve an agent’s unacceptable behavior—assault—but \nin Lyon the agent’s actions were imputed to the principal, and in Cockrell the agent’s actions were not \nimputed to the principal. \n2. What is the controlling rule of law governing the principal’s liability for the agent’s actions? \n3. The law governing the liability of principals for acts of their agents is well settled. Thus the cases turn on the \nfacts. Who decides what the facts are in a lawsuit? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nA contract made by an agent on behalf of the principal legally binds the principal. Three types of authority \nmay bind the principal: (1) express authority—that which is actually given and spelled out, (2) implied \nauthority—that which may fairly be inferred from the parties’ relationship and which is incidental to the \nagent’s express authority, and (3) apparent authority—that which reasonably appears to a third party \nunder the circumstances to have been given by the principal. Even in the absence of authority, a principal \nmay ratify the agent’s acts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n452 \nThe principal may be liable for tortious acts of the agent but except under certain regulatory statutes may \nnot be held criminally liable for criminal acts of agents not prompted by the principal. Under the doctrine \nof respondeat superior, a principal is generally liable for acts by a servant within the scope of employment. \nA principal usually will not be held liable for acts of nonservant agents that cause physical damage, \nalthough he will be held liable for nonphysical torts, such as misrepresentation. The principal will not be \nheld liable for tortious acts of independent contractors, although the principal may be liable for injuries \nresulting from his failure to act in situations in which he was not legally permitted to delegate a duty to \nact. Whenever an agent is acting to further the principal’s business interests, the principal will be held \nvicariously liable for the agent’s intentional torts. What constitutes scope of employment is not easy to \ndetermine; the modern trend is to hold a principal liable for the conduct of an agent if it was foreseeable \nthat the agent might act as he did. \n \nMost states have special rules of vicarious liability for special situations; for example, liability of an \nautomobile owner for use by another. Spouses are not vicariously liable for each other, nor are parents for \nchildren, except for failing to control children known to be dangerous.",

            "chunk": "the partnership”—that’s handy where the plaintiff hopes for a judgment against the partnership, without \nrecourse to the individual partners’ personal assets. [6] But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and \nthe partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment \nagainst a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating \nthat partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in \npartnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership. [8] Under RUPA, \n“property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.” [9] But RUPA \nis no different from UPA in practical effect. The latter provides that “property originally brought into the \npartnership stock or subsequently acquired by purchase…on account of the partnership, is partnership \nproperty.” [10] Under either law, a partner may bring onto the partnership premises her own property, not \nacquired in the name of the partnership or with its credit, and it remains her separate property. Under \nneither law can a partner unilaterally dispose of partnership property, however labeled, for the obvious \nreason that one cannot dispose of another’s property or property rights without permission. [11] And keep \nin mind that partnership law is the default: partners are free to make up partnership agreements as they \nlike, subject to some limitations.

The partnership cannot discharge its debts in a liquidation proceeding under \nChapter 7 of the bankruptcy law, but it can be rehabilitated under Chapter 11 (see Chapter 27 \n\"Bankruptcy\"). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nPartnership law is very important because it is the way most small businesses are organized and because it is \npossible for a person to become a partner without intending to. Partnership law goes back a long way, but in \nthe United States, most states—but not all—have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA, 1997) \nover the previous Uniform Partnership Act, originally promulgated in 1914. One salient change made by RUPA \nis to directly announce that a partnership is an entity: it is like a person for purposes of accounting, litigation, \nbankruptcy, and owning real estate. Partnerships do not pay taxes; the individual partners do. But in practical \nterms, what RUPA does is codify already-existing state law on these matters, and partners are free to organize \ntheir relationship as they like in the partnership agreement. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

For example, \nMr. Tot and Mr. Tut own equal shares of a house that they rent but do not regard it as a business and are \nnot in fact partners. They do have a loose “understanding” that since Mr. Tot is mechanically adept, he \nwill make necessary repairs whenever the tenants call. On his way to the house one day to fix its boiler, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n470 \nMr. Tot injures a pedestrian, who sues both Mr. Tot and Mr. Tut. Since they are not partners, the \npedestrian cannot sue them as if they were; hence Mr. Tut has no partnership liability. \n \nSuppose that Mr. Tot and Mr. Tut happened to go to a lumberyard together to purchase materials that Mr. \nTot intended to use to add a room to the house. Short of cash, Mr. Tot looks around and espies Mr. Tat, \nwho greets his two friends heartily by saying within earshot of the salesman who is debating whether to \nextend credit, “Well, how are my two partners this morning?” Messrs. Tot and Tut say nothing but smile \nfaintly at the salesman, who mistakenly but reasonably believes that the two are acknowledging the \npartnership. The salesman knows Mr. Tat well and assumes that since Mr. Tat is rich, extending credit to \nthe “partnership” is a “sure thing.” Messrs. Tot and Tut fail to pay. The lumberyard is entitled to collect \nfrom Mr. Tat, even though he may have forgotten completely about the incident by the time suit is filed. \nUnder Uniform Partnership Act Section 16(1), Mr. Tat would be liable for the debt as being part of \na partnership by estoppel. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect: \n \nSection 308. Liability of Purported Partner. \n \n(a) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented \nby another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the \npurported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, \nrelying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. \n \nPartnership by estoppel has two elements: (1) a representation to a third party that there is in fact a \npartnership and (2) reliance by the third party on the representation. See Section 11.3.3 \"Partnership by \nEstoppel\", Chavers v. Epsco, Inc., for an example of partnership by estoppel. \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA partnership is any two or more persons—including corporate persons—carrying on a business as co-owners \nfor profit. A primary test of whether a partnership exists is whether there is a sharing of profits, though other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n471 \nfactors such as sharing decision making, sharing liabilities, and how the business is operated are also \nexamined. \nMost partnerships are expressly created. Several factors become important in the partnership agreement, \nwhether written or oral. These include the name of the business, the capital contributions of each partner, \nprofit sharing, and decision making. But a partnership can also arise by implication or by estoppel, where one \nhas held herself as a partner and another has relied on that representation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is it necessary—or at least useful—to have tests to determine whether a partnership exists? \n2. What elements of the business organization are examined to make this determination? \n3. Jacob rents farmland from Davis and pays Davis a part of the profits from the crop in rent. Is Davis a \npartner? What if Davis offers suggestions on what to plant and when? Now is he a partner? \n4. What elements should be included in a written partnership agreement? \n5. What is an implied partnership? \n6. What is a partnership by estoppel, and why are its “partners” estopped to deny its existence? \n \n  \n \n[1] A joint venture—sometimes known as a joint adventure, coadventure, joint enterprise, joint undertaking, \nsyndicate, group, or pool—is an association of persons to carry on a particular task until completed. In essence, a \njoint venture is a “temporary partnership.” In the United States, the use of joint ventures began with the railroads \nin the late 1800s. Throughout the middle part of the twentieth century joint ventures were common in the \nmanufacturing sector.

In this way, they can achieve economies of scale and avoid duplication of effort. A joint venture also allows a company to diversify its operations without risking its own capital or that of its shareholders. In the United States, joint ventures are usually formed by means of a written contract. In this contract, the parties agree to the joint venture’s purpose, the duration of the joint venture, the division of profits, and the allocation of risk. They may also agree on the name of the joint venture, the authority of the joint venture’s management, and the way in which the joint venture’s assets will be allocated among the parties at the end of the venture. The contract may also provide for arbitration of disputes or specify a court of jurisdiction."

                    "question": "What is an implied partnership?",
                    "answer": "An implied partnership is a partnership that is created when the partners have not expressly agreed to be partners. The law implies that the partners are partners because of their conduct. The most common type of implied partnership is a partnership by estoppel. A partnership by estoppel is created when one person holds himself out as a partner, and another person relies on that representation to his detriment. For example, if a person holds himself out as a partner in a business, and another person relies on that representation and invests money in the business, the law will imply a partnership between the two. This is because the law wants to protect people who rely on the representation of another. It is unfair to allow a person to hold himself out as a partner and then deny that he is a partner when another person has relied on that representation. The law will not allow a person to take advantage of another person in this way. A partnership by estoppel is also known as a constructive partnership."

If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important. Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade. The paragraph also declared that upon \ndissolution of the partnership, ownership of items would revert to the party providing them. The third \nparagraph declared that the income of the partnership would be divided 30% for Chaiken, 70% for \nStrazella; 20% for Chaiken and 80% for Spitzer. The fourth paragraph declared that all partnership policy \nwould be decided by Chaiken, whose decision was final. The fifth paragraph forbade assignment of the \nagreement without permission of Chaiken. The sixth paragraph required Chaiken to hold and distribute \nall receipts. The final paragraph stated hours of work for Strazella and Spitzer and holidays. \n \nThe mere existence of an agreement labeled “partnership” agreement and the characterization of \nsignatories as “partners” docs not conclusively prove the existence of a partnership. Rather, the intention \nof the parties, as explained by the wording of the agreement, is paramount. \n \nA partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for \nprofit. As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept. Co-owners should also contribute valuable consideration \nfor the creation of the business. Under paragraph two, however, Chaiken provides the barber chair (and \nimplicitly the barber shop itself), mirror, licenses and linen, while the other partners merely provide their \ntools and labor—nothing more than any barber-employee would furnish. Standing alone, however, mere \ncontribution of work and skill can be valuable consideration for a partnership agreement. \n \nPartnership interests may be assignable, although it is not a violation of partnership law to prohibit \nassignment in a partnership agreement. Therefore, paragraph five on assignment of partnership interests \ndoes not violate the partnership concept. On the other hand, distribution of partnership assets to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n475 \npartners upon dissolution is only allowed after all partnership liabilities are satisfied. But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent,",

The fax cover sheet contained the address, telephone \nnumber, and fax number of the business. Listed under this information was “Gary, Reggie, or Mark \nChavers.” Epsco argues that Gary, Reggie, and Mark are all listed on the fax cover sheet, and that this \nindicates that they were holding themselves out to the public as partners of the business. The trial court’s \nfinding that the fax cover sheet indicated that Reggie and Mark were holding themselves out as partners \nof CWC is not clearly erroneous. \n \nThe Epsco Personnel Credit Application \nEpsco introduced Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 9, a personnel credit application, which was received from CWC. \nAdams testified that the exhibit represented a completed credit application that she received from CWC. \nThe type of business checked on the credit application is “partnership.” Adams testified that the \napplication showed the company to be a partnership, and that this information was relied upon in \nextending credit. Clegg testified that he viewed the credit application which indicated that CWC was a \npartnership, and that his decision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was \na partnership. Gary denied filling out the credit application form. \n \nIt was within the trial court’s discretion to find Adams’s and Clegg’s testimony more credible than Gary’s \ntestimony and to determine that Epsco relied on the statement of partnership on the credit application \nbefore extending credit to CWC.

Chavers,” indicates that Reggie was holding \nhimself out to be a partner of CWC. Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 3 was signed by Gary, and Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 11 \nwas signed by Reggie. The checks are evidence that Reggie was holding himself out to the public as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n485 \npartner of CWC, and Epsco could have detrimentally relied on the checks before extending credit to CWC. \nThe trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the checks supported a finding of partnership by \nestoppel. \n \nThe Business Card \nEpsco introduced Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 4, a business card that states “Chavers Welding, Construction & \nCrane Service.” Listed on the card as “owners” are Gary Chavers and Reggie Chavers. Gary testified that \nthe business cards were printed incorrectly, and that Reggie’s name should not have been included as an \nowner. He also testified that some of the cards might have been handed out, and that it was possible that \nhe might have given one of the cards to a business listed as one of CWC’s credit references on Plaintiff’s \nExhibit # 1. \n \nThe business card listing Reggie as an owner indicates that Reggie was holding himself out as a partner. \nAs we stated in [Citation] when a person holds himself out as a member of partnership, any one dealing \nwith the firm on the faith of such representation is entitled to assume the relation continues until notice of \nsome kind is given of its discontinuance. There is no indication that Reggie ever informed any person who \nreceived a business card that the business relationship listed on the card was incorrect or had been \ndiscontinued.

The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of \nother partners’ successes (and pay for their failures too).

The liability is a loan owing to the \npartner by the firm. \nRight to Return of Capital Contribution \nWhen a partner joins a partnership, she is expected to make a capital contribution to the firm; this may be \ndeducted from her share of the distributed profit and banked by the firm in its capital account. The law \nprovides that “the partnership must reimburse a partner for an advance of funds beyond the amount of \nthe partner’s agreed capital contribution, thereby treating the advance as a loan.” [10] A partner may get a \nreturn of capital under UPA after creditors are paid off if the business is wound down and terminated. [11] \n \nRight to Compensation \nSection 401(d) of RUPA provides that “a partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for \nthe partnership, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of \nthe partnership”; UPA Section 18(f) is to the same effect. A partner gets his money from the firm by \nsharing the profits, not by a salary or wages. \n \nRight to Management \nAll partners are entitled to share equally in the management and conduct of the business, unless the \npartnership agreement provides otherwise. [12] The partnership agreement could be structured to delegate \nmore decision-making power to one class of partners (senior partners) than to others (junior partners), or \nit may give more voting weight to certain individuals. For example, perhaps those with the most \nexperience will, for the first four years after a new partner is admitted, have more voting weight than the \nnew partner. \n \nRight to Choose Partners \nA business partnership is often analogized to a marriage partnership. In both there is a relationship of \ntrust and confidence between (or among) the parties; in both the poor judgment, negligence, or \ndishonesty of one can create liabilities on the other(s). In a good marriage or good partnership, the \npartners are friends, whatever else the legal relationship imposes. Thus no one is compelled to accept a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n498 \npartner against his or her will. Section 401(i) of RUPA provides, “A person may become a partner only \nwith the consent of all of the partners.” UPA Section 18(g) is to the same effect; the doctrine is called \ndelectus personae. The freedom to select new partners, however, is not absolute. In 1984, the Supreme \nCourt held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—which prohibits discrimination in employment \nbased on race, religion, national origin, or sex—applies to partnerships. [13] \n \nRight to Property of the Partnership \nPartners are the owners of the partnership, which might not include any physical property; that is, one \npartner could contribute the building, furnishings, and equipment and rent those to the partnership (or \nthose could count as her partnership capital contribution and become the partnership’s). But partnership \nproperty consists of all property originally advanced or contributed to the partnership or subsequently \nacquired by purchase or contribution.

As spelled out in Section 25(2), the specific property interest of a tenant in \npartnership vests in the surviving partners, not in the heirs. But the heirs are entitled to the deceased \npartner’s interest in the partnership itself, so that while Baker and Carr may use the partnership property \nfor the benefit of the partnership without consulting Able’s heirs, they must account to her heirs for her \nproper share of the partnership’s profits. \n \n \n \nRights in Specific Property: RUPA Approach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n499 \nSection 501 of RUPA provides, “A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in \npartnership property which can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily.” Partnership property \nis owned by the entity; UPA’s concept of tenants in partnership is abolished in favor of adoption of the \nentity theory. The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights. A partner’s \n‘transferable interest’ is a more limited concept and means only his share of the profits and losses and \nright to receive distributions, that is, the partner’s economic interests.” [17] \n \nThis transferable interest is assignable under RUPA 503 (unless the partners agree to restrict transfers, \nSection 103(a)). It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty?

[3] Limited liability partnerships are taken up \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nGenerally, RUPA Section 105 allows partnerships to file these statements with the state secretary of state’s \noffice; those affecting real estate need to be filed with (or also with) the local county land recorder’s office. \nThe notices bind those who know about them right away, and they are constructive notice to the world \nafter ninety days as to authority to transfer real property in the partnership’s name, as to dissociation, and \nas to dissolution. However, as to other grants or limitations of authority, “only a third party who knows or \nhas received a notification of a partner’s lack of authority in an ordinary course transaction is bound.” [4] \n \nSince RUPA is mostly intended to provide the rules for the small, unsophisticated partnership, it is \nquestionable whether these arcane “statements” are very often employed. \n \nPersonal Liability of Partners, in General \nIt is clear that the partnership is liable for contracts by authorized partners, as discussed in the preceding \nparagraphs. The bad thing about the partnership as a form of business organization is that it imposes \nliability on the partners personally and without limit. Section 306 of RUPA provides that “all partners are \nliable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or \nprovided by law.” [5] Section 13 of UPA is in accord. \n \nLiability of Existing Partners \nContract liability is joint and several: that is, all partners are liable (“joint”) and each is “several.” (We \nusually do not use several in modern English to mean “each”; it’s an archaic usage.) But—and here’s the \nintrusion of entity theory—generally RUPA requires the judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s \nassets before going after the separate assets of a partner. Thus under RUPA the partners \nare guarantors of the partnership’s liabilities. [6] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n508 \nUnder UPA, contract liability is joint only, not also several. This means the partners must be sued in a \njoint action brought against them all. A partner who is not named cannot later be sued by a creditor in a \nseparate proceeding, though the ones who were named could see a proportionate contribution from the \nones who were not. \n \nLiability of Incoming Partners \nUnder RUPA Section 306(b), a new partner has no personal liability to existing creditors of the \npartnership, and only her capital investment in the firm is at risk for the satisfaction of existing \npartnership debts. Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners. Even after winning a judgment, the plaintiff may \nsue other partners unnamed in the original action.

[7] The firm may need to borrow money to pay the former partner or her \nestate; or, in the case of a deceased partner, the money to pay the former partner is obtained through a life \ninsurance buyout policy. \n \nPartnerships routinely insure the lives of the partners, who have no ownership interests in the insurance \npolicies. The policies should bear a face amount equal to each partner’s interest in the partnership and \nshould be adjusted as the fortunes of the partnership change. Proceeds of the insurance policy are used on \ndeath to pay the purchase price of the interest inherited by the deceased’s estate. If the insurance policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n515 \npays out more than the interest at stake, the partnership retains the difference.

Assume that when Baker left, the business owed Mogul Parts Company \n$5,000 and Laid Back Upholsterers $4,000.

According to the comment, RUPA \ndramatically changes the law governing partnership breakups and dissolution. An entirely new concept, \n“dissociation,” is used in lieu of UPA term “dissolution” to denote the change in the relationship caused by \na partner’s ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business. “Dissolution” is retained but with a \ndifferent meaning. The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm \nitself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. \n \nUnder UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any \nmember from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an \nentity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs \nwhen any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA \nrequires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. \n \nDissociation \nDissociation, as noted in the previous paragraph, is the change in relations caused by a partner’s \nwithdrawal from the firm’s business. \n \nCauses of Dissociation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n517 \nDissociation is caused in ten possible ways: (1) a partner says she wants out; (2) an event triggers \ndissociation as per the partnership agreement; (3) a partner is expelled as per the agreement; (4) a \npartner is expelled by unanimous vote of the others because it is unlawful to carry on with that partner, \nbecause that partner has transferred to a transferee all interest in the partnership (except for security \npurposes), or because a corporate partner’s or partnership partner’s existence is effectively terminated; \n(5) by a court order upon request by the partnership or another partner because the one expelled has been \ndetermined to have misbehaved (engaged in serious wrongful conduct, persists in abusing the agreement, \nacts in ways making continuing the business impracticable); (6) the partner has declared bankruptcy; (7) \nthe partner has died or had a guardian appointed, or has been adjudicated as incompetent; (8) the partner \nis a trust whose assets are exhausted; (9) the partner is an estate and the estate’s interest in the \npartnership has been entirely transferred; (10) the partner dies or, if the partner is another partnership or \na corporation trust or estate, that entity’s existence is terminated. [11] \n \nEffect of Dissociation \nAfter a partner dissociates, the partner’s right to participate in management terminates. (However, if the \ndissociation goes on to dissolution and winding up, partners who have not wrongfully caused the \ndissociation may participate in winding-up activities.) [12] The dissociated partner’s duty of loyalty and \ncare terminates; the former partner may compete with the firm, except for matters arising before the \ndissociation. [13] \n \nWhen partners come and go, as they do, problems may arise. What power does the dissociated partner \nhave to bind the partnership? What power does the partnership have to impose liability on the dissociated \none? RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or \nher apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would \nhave bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the \ndissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have",

[25] \n \nSettlement of Accounts among Partners \nDetermining the priority of liabilities can be problematic. For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and \nfinally (4) to partners for their share of profits (see Figure 12.3 \"Priority Partnership Liabilities under \nRUPA\"). However, RUPA eliminates the distinction between capital and profits when the firm pays \npartners what is owed to them; RUPA Section 807(b) speaks simply of the right of a partner to a \nliquidating distribution. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12.3 Priority Partnership Liabilities under RUPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n522 \n \n \nPartners are entitled to share equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including \nthose owed to partners, are paid off, although the partnership agreement can state a different share—for \nexample, in proportion to capital contribution. If after winding up there is a net loss, whether capital or \notherwise, each partner must contribute toward it in accordance with his share in the profits, had there \nbeen any, unless the agreement states otherwise. If any of the partners is insolvent or refuses to contribute \nand cannot be sued, the others must contribute their own share to pay off the liabilities and in addition \nmust contribute, in proportion to their share of the profits, the additional amount necessary to pay the \nliabilities of their defaulting partners. \n \nIn the event of insolvency, a court may take possession of both partnership property and individual assets \nof the partners; this again is a big disadvantage to the partnership form. \n \nThe estate of a deceased partner is credited or liable as that partner would have been if she were living at \nthe time of the distribution. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder UPA, the withdrawal of any partner from the partnership causes dissolution; the withdrawal may be \ncaused in accordance with the agreement, in violation of the agreement, by operation of law, or by court \norder. Dissolution terminates the partners’ authority to act for the partnership, except for winding up, but \nremaining partners may decide to carry on as a new partnership or may decide to terminate the firm.

If the partners move to terminate the firm, winding up begins. \nUnder RUPA, a partner who ceases to be involved in the business is dissociated, but dissociation does not \nnecessarily cause dissolution. Dissociation happens when a partner quits, voluntarily or involuntarily; when a \npartner dies or becomes incompetent; or on request by the firm or a partner upon court order for a partner’s \nwrongful conduct, among other reasons.

If the firm proceeds to \ntermination (though partners can stop the process before its end), the next step is dissolution, which occurs \nby acts of partners, by operation of law, or by court order upon application by a partner if continuing the \nbusiness has become untenable. After dissolution, the only business undertaken is to wind up affairs. \nHowever, the firm may continue after dissociation; it must buy out the dissociated one’s interest, minus \ndamages if the dissociation was wrongful. \nIf the firm is to be terminated, winding up entails finishing the business at hand, paying off creditors, and \nsplitting the remaining surplus or liabilities according the parties’ agreement or, absent any, according to the \nrelevant act (UPA or RUPA). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Conway \n391 N.W. 2d 419 (Mich. App. 1986) \n \nPETERSON, J. \n \nDefendant cheated his partner and appeals from the trial court’s judgment granting that partner a \nremedy. \n \nPlaintiff was an established commercial photographer in Kalamazoo who also had a partnership interest \nin another photography business, Colonial Studios, in Coldwater. In 1974, defendant became plaintiff’s \npartner in Colonial Studios, the name of which was changed to Skylight Studios. Under the partnership \nagreement, defendant was to be the operating manager of the partnership, in return for which he would \nhave a guaranteed draw. Except for the guaranteed draw, the partnership was equal in ownership and the \nsharing of profits. \nPrior to defendant’s becoming a partner, the business had acquired a small contractual clientele of schools \nfor which the business provided student portrait photographs. The partners agreed to concentrate on this \ntype of business, and both partners solicited schools with success. Gross sales, which were $40,000 in \n1974, increased every year and amounted to $209,085 in 1980 [about $537,000 in 2011 dollars]. \n \nIn the spring of 1981, defendant offered to buy out plaintiff and some negotiations followed. On June 25, \n1981, however, plaintiff was notified by the defendant that the partnership was dissolved as of July 1, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n526 \n1981. Plaintiff discovered that defendant: had closed up the partnership’s place of business and opened up \nhis own business; had purchased equipment and supplies in preparation for commencing his own \nbusiness and charged them to the partnership; and had taken with him the partnership employees and \nmost of its equipment. \n \nDefendant had also stolen the partnership’s business. He had personally taken over the business of some \ncustomers by telling them that the partnership was being dissolved; in other cases he simply took over \npartnership contracts without telling the customers that he was then operating on his own. Plaintiff also \nlearned that defendant’s deceit had included the withdrawal, without plaintiff’s knowledge, of partnership \nfunds for defendant’s personal use in 1978 in an amount exceeding $11,000 [about $36,000 in 2011 \ndollars]. \n \nThe trial judge characterized the case as a “classic study of greed” and found that defendant had in effect \nappropriated the business enterprise, holding that defendant had “knowingly and willfully violated his \nfiduciary relationship as a partner by converting partnership assets to his use and, in doing so, literally \ndestroying the partnership.” He also found that the partnership could have been sold as a going business \non June 30, 1981, and that after a full accounting, it had a value on that date of $94,596 less accounts",

The division thereof after adjustments for plaintiff’s \npositive equity or capital resulted in an award to plaintiff for his interest in the business of $53,779.46 \n[about $126,000 in 2011 dollars].… \nPlaintiff also sought exemplary [punitive] damages. Count II of the complaint alleged that defendant’s \nconduct constituted a breach of defendant’s fiduciary duty to his partner under §§ 19-22 of the Uniform \nPartnership Act, and Count III alleged conversion of partnership property. Each count contained \nallegations that defendant’s conduct was willful, wanton and in reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights and \nthat such conduct had caused injury to plaintiff’s feelings, including humiliation, indignity and a sense of \nmoral outrage. The prayer for relief sought exemplary damages therefore. \n \nPlaintiff’s testimony on the point was brief. He said: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n527 \nThe effect of really the whole situation, and I think it was most apparent when I walked into the \nempty building, was extreme disappointment and really total outrage at the fact that something \nthat I had given the utmost of my talent and creativity, energy, and whatever time was necessary \nto build, was totally destroyed and there was just nothing of any value that was left.…My \nbusiness had been stolen and there wasn’t a thing that I could do about it. And to me, that was \nvery humiliating that one day I had something that I had worked 10 years on, and the next day I \nhad absolutely nothing of any value. \n \nAs noted above, the trial judge found that defendant had literally destroyed the partnership by knowingly \nand willfully converting partnership assets in violation of his fiduciary duty as a partner. He also found \nthat plaintiff had suffered a sense of outrage, indignity and humiliation and awarded him $10,000 \n[$23,000 in 2011 dollars] as exemplary damages. \n \nDefendant appeals from that award, asserting that plaintiff’s cause of action arises from a breach of the \npartnership contract and that exemplary damages may not be awarded for breach of that contract.… \n \nIf it were to be assumed that a partner’s breach of his fiduciary duty or appropriation of partnership \nequipment and business contract to his own use and profit are torts, it is clear that the duty breached \narises from the partnership contract. One acquires the property interest of a co-tenant in partnership only \nby the contractual creation of a partnership; one becomes a fiduciary in partnership only by the \ncontractual undertaking to become a partner. There is no tortious conduct here existing independent of \nthe breach of the partnership contract. \n \nNeither do we see anything in the Uniform Partnership Act to suggest that an aggrieved partner is entitled \nto any remedy other than to be made whole economically. The act defines identically the partnership \nfiduciary duty and the remedy for its breach, i.e., to account: \n \nSec. 21. (1) Every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for \nit any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n528 \nconnected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him \nof its property. \n \nSo, the cases involving a partner’s breach of the fiduciary duty to their partners have been concerned \nsolely with placing the wronged partners in the economic position that they would have enjoyed but for \nthe breach. \n \n[Judgment for plaintiff affirmed, as modified with regard to damages.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. For what did the court award the plaintiff $53,000? \n2. The court characterizes the defendant as having “cheated his partner”—that is, Conway committed \nfraud.

In fact, \npunitive damages are sometimes awarded for breach of the partnership fiduciary duty. In Cadwalader, \nWickersham & Taft v. Beasley, 728 So.2d 253 (Florida Ct.

Lopez \n115 S.W.3d 221 (Texas App. 2003) \n \nHolman, J. \n \nWayne A. Long [plaintiff at the trial court] sued Appellee Sergio Lopez to recover from him, jointly and \nseverally, his portion of a partnership debt that Long had paid. After a bench trial, the trial court ruled \nthat Long take nothing from Appellee. We reverse and render, and remand for calculation of attorney’s \nfees in this suit and pre- and post-judgment interest. \n \nLong testified that in September 1996, Long, Lopez, and Don Bannister entered into an oral partnership \nagreement in which they agreed to be partners in Wood Relo (“the partnership”), a trucking business \nlocated in Gainesville, Texas. Wood Relo located loads for and dispatched approximately twenty trucks it \nleased from owner-operators.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n533 \nThe trial court found that Long, Lopez, and Bannister formed a partnership, Wood Relo, without a written \npartnership agreement. Lopez does not contest these findings. \n \nLong testified that to properly conduct the partnership’s business, he entered into an office equipment \nlease with IKON Capital Corporation (“IKON”) on behalf of the partnership. The lease was a thirty-month \ncontract under which the partnership leased a telephone system, fax machine, and photocopier at a rate of \n$577.91 per month. The lease agreement was between IKON and Wood Relo; the “authorized signer” was \nlisted as Wayne Long, who also signed as personal guarantor. \n \nLong stated that all three partners were authorized to buy equipment for use by the partnership. He \ntestified that the partners had agreed that it was necessary for the partnership to lease the equipment and \nthat on the day the equipment was delivered to Wood Relo’s office, Long was the only partner at the \noffice; therefore, Long was the only one available to sign the lease and personal guaranty that IKON \nrequired. [The partnership disintegrated when Bannister left and he later filed for bankruptcy.]…Long \ntestified that when Bannister left Wood Relo, the partnership still had “quite a few” debts to pay, \nincluding the IKON lease.… \n \nEventually, IKON did repossess all the leased equipment. Long testified that he received a demand letter \nfrom IKON, requesting payment by Wood Relo of overdue lease payments and accelerating payment of \nthe remaining balance of the lease. IKON sought recovery of past due payments in the amount of \n$2,889.55 and accelerated future lease payments in the amount of $11,558.20, for a total of $14,447.75, \nplus interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, with the total exceeding $16,000. Long testified that he advised \nLopez that he had received the demand letter from IKON. \n \nUltimately, IKON filed a lawsuit against Long individually and d/b/a Wood Relo, but did not name Lopez \nor Bannister as parties to the suit. Through his counsel, Long negotiated a settlement with IKON for a \ntotal of $9,000. An agreed judgment was entered in conjunction with the settlement agreement providing \nthat if Long did not pay the settlement, Wood Relo and Long would owe IKON $12,000. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n534 \nAfter settling the IKON lawsuit, Long’s counsel sent a letter to Lopez and Bannister regarding the \nsettlement agreement, advising them that they were jointly and severally liable for the $9,000 that \nextinguished the partnership’s debt to IKON, plus attorney’s fees.… \n \nThe trial court determined that Long was not entitled to reimbursement from Lopez because Long was not \nacting for the partnership when he settled IKON’s claim against the partnership. The court based its \nconclusion on the fact that Long had no “apparent authority with respect to lawsuits” and had not notified \nLopez of the IKON lawsuit. \n \nAnalysis \nTo the extent that a partnership agreement does not otherwise specify, the provisions of the Texas Revised \nPartnership Act govern the relations of the partners and between the partners and the partnership. \n[Citations] Under the Act, each partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the business \nof a partnership.

There are two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited partners capitalize \nthe business and the general partners run it. \n \nCreation \nThe act requires that the firm’s promoters file a certificate of limited partnership with the secretary \nof state; if they do not, or if the certificate is substantially defective, a general partnership is created. The \ncertificate must be signed by all general partners. It must include the name of the limited partnership \n(which must include the words limited partnership so the world knows there are owners of the firm who \nare not liable beyond their contribution) and the names and business addresses of the general partners. If \nthere are any changes in the general partners, the certificate must be amended. The general partner may \nbe, and often is, a corporation.

Here is an example of \na limited partnership operating \nagreement:http://www.wyopa.com/Articles%20of%20limited%20partnership.htm. \n \nAny natural person, partnership, limited partnership (domestic or foreign), trust, estate, association, or \ncorporation may become a partner of a limited partnership. \n \nCapitalization \nThe money to capitalize the business typically comes mostly from the limited partners, who may \nthemselves be partnerships or corporations. That is, the limited partners use the business as an \ninvestment device: they hope the managers of the firm (the general partners) will take their contributions \nand give them a positive return on it. The contributions may be money, services, or property, or promises \nto make such contributions in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nControl is not generally shared by both classes of partners. \n \nGeneral Partners \nThe control of the limited partnership is in the hands of the general partners, which may—as noted—be \npartnerships or corporations. \n \nLimited Partners \nUnder ULPA-1985 and its predecessors, a limited partner who exercised any significant control would \nincur liability like a general partner as to third parties who believed she was one (the “control rule”). \nHowever, among the things a limited partner could do that would not risk the loss of insulation from \npersonal liability were these “safe harbors”: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n551 \n• \nActing as an agent, employee, or contractor for the firm; or being an officer, director, or \nshareholder of a corporate general partner \n• \nConsulting with the general partner of the firm \n• \nRequesting or attending a meeting of partners \n• \nBeing a surety for the firm \n• \nVoting on amendments to the agreement, on dissolution or winding up the partnership, on loans \nto the partnership, on a change in its nature of business, on removing or admitting a general or \nlimited partner \n \nHowever, see Section 13.3.3 \"Limited Liability Limited Partnerships\" for how this “control rule” has been \nabolished under ULPA-2001. \nGeneral partners owe fiduciary duties to other general partners, the firm, and the limited partners; limited \npartners who do not exercise control do not owe fiduciary duties. See Figure 13.1 \"The Limited \nPartnership under ULPA-1985\". \n \nFigure 13.1 The Limited Partnership under ULPA-1985 \n \n \nThe partnership agreement may specify which general or limited partners have the right to vote on any \nmatter, but if the agreement grants limited partners voting rights beyond the “safe harbor,” a court may \nabolish that partner’s limited liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n552 \nAssignment of Partnership Rights \nLimited partnership interests may be assigned in whole or in part; if in whole, the assignor ceases to be a \npartner unless otherwise agreed. An assignment is usually made as security for a loan. The assignee \nbecomes a new limited partner only if all the others consent or if provided for in the certificate; the \nassignment does not cause dissolution. The happy ease with which a limited partner can divest himself of \nthe partnership interest makes the investment in the firm here more like that in a corporation than in a \ngeneral partnership. \n \n \n \n \nInspection of Books \nLimited partners have the right to inspect the firm’s books and records, they may own competing",

Contributions may be in the form of cash, property or services rendered, or a promise \nto render them in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nThe LLC operating agreement may provide for either a member-managed LLC or a manager-managed \n(centralized) LLC. If the former, all members have actual and apparent authority to bind the LLC to \ncontracts on its behalf, as in a partnership, and all members’ votes have equal weight unless otherwise \nagreed. Member-managers have duty of care and a fiduciary duty, though the parameters of those duties \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n559 \nvary from state to state. If the firm is manager managed, only managers have authority to bind the firm; \nthe managers have the duty of care and fiduciary duty, but the nonmanager members usually do not. \nSome states’ statutes provide that voting is based on the financial interests of the members. Most statutes \nprovide that any extraordinary firm decisions be voted on by all members (e.g., amend the agreement, \nadmit new members, sell all the assets prior to dissolution, merge with another entity). Members can \nmake their own rules without the structural requirements (e.g., voting rights, notice, quorum, approval of \nmajor decisions) imposed under state corporate law. \n \nIf the firm has a centralized manager system, it gets a check in its “corporate-like” box, so it will need to \nmake sure there are enough noncorporate-like attributes to make up for this one. If it looks too much like \na corporation, it will be taxed like one. \n \nOne of the real benefits of the LLC as compared with the corporation is that no annual meetings are \nrequired, and no minutes need to be kept. Often, owners of small corporations ignore these formalities to \ntheir peril, but with the LLC there are no worries about such record keeping. \n \nCompensation \nDistributions are allocated among members of an LLC according to the operating agreement; managing \npartners may be paid for their services. Absent an agreement, distributions are allocated among members \nin proportion to the values of contributions made by them or required to be made by them. Upon a \nmember’s dissociation that does not cause dissolution, a dissociating member has the right to distribution \nas provided in the agreement, or—if no agreement—the right to receive the fair value of the member’s \ninterest within a reasonable time after dissociation. No distributions are allowed if making them would \ncause the LLC to become insolvent. \n \nLiability \nThe great accomplishment of the LLC is, again, to achieve limited liability for all its members: no general \npartner hangs out with liability exposure. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n560 \nLiability to Outsiders \nMembers are not liable to third parties for contracts made by the firm or for torts committed in the scope \nof business (but of course a person is always liable for her own torts), regardless of the owner’s level of \nparticipation—unlike a limited partnership, where the general partner is liable. Third parties’ only \nrecourse is as against the firm’s property. See Puleo v. Topel, (see Section 13.4.2 \"Liability Issues in \nLLCs\"), for an analysis of owner liability in an LLC. \n \nInternal Liabilities \nUnless the operating agreement provides otherwise, members and managers of the LLC are generally not \nliable to the firm or its members except for acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, intentional \nmisconduct, or knowing violations of the law. Members and managers, though, must account to the firm \nfor any personal profit or benefit derived from activities not consented to by a majority of disinterested \nmembers or managers from the conduct of the firm’s business or member’s or managers use of firm \nproperty—which is the same as in partnership law. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the LLC is properly formed so that it is not too much like a corporation, it will—upon its \nmembers’ election—be treated like a partnership for tax purposes. \n \nTermination \nTermination, loosely speaking, refers either to how the entity’s life as a business ends (continuity of life) \nor to how a member’s interest in the firm ends—that is, how freely the interest is transferable. \n \nContinuity of Life \nThe first step in the termination of the LLC is dissolution, though dissolution is not necessarily followed \nby termination. \n \nDissolution and Winding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n561 \nThe IRS has determined that continuity of life does not exist “if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, \nretirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization,” [1] and \nthat if one of these events occurs, the entity may continue only with the members’ unanimous consent.",

And by this means the firm does not have continuity of life. Some states provide \nopportunities for even more flexibility regarding the “unanimous” part. In the mid-1990s, the IRS issued \nrevenue rulings (as opposed to regulations) that it would be enough if a “majority in interest” of \nremaining partners agreed to continue the business, and the “flexible” statute states adopted this \npossibility (the ones that did not are called “bulletproof” statutes). “Majority in interests” means a \nmajority of profits and capital. \n \nIf the firm does dissolve, some states require public filings to that effect. If dissolution leads to winding \nup, things progress as in a general partnership: the business at hand is finished, accounts are rendered, \nbills paid, assets liquidated, and remaining assets are distributed to creditors (including member and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n562 \nmanager creditors, but not for their shares in profits); to members and past members for unpaid \ndistributions; to members for capital contributions; and to members as agreed or in proportion to \ncontributions made. Upon dissolution, actual authority of members or managers terminates except as \nneeded to wind up; members may have apparent authority, though, unless the third party had notice of \nthe dissolution. \n \nFree Transferability of Interest \nAgain, the problem here is that if a member’s interest in the LLC is as freely transferable as a \nshareholder’s interest in a corporation (an owner can transfer all attributes of his interest without the \nothers’ consent), the LLC will probably be said to have a check mark in the “corporate-like” box: too many \nof those and the firm will not be allowed pass-through taxation. Thus the trick for the LLC promoters is to \nlimit free transferability enough to pass the test of not being a corporation, but not limit so much as to \nmake it really difficult to divest oneself of the interest (then it’s not a very liquid or desirable investment). \n \nSome states’ LLC statutes have as the default rule that the remaining members must unanimously consent \nto allow an assignee or a transferee of a membership interest to participate in managing the LLC. Since \nthis prevents a member from transferring all attributes of the interest (the right to participate in \nmanagement isn’t transferred or assigned), the LLC formed under the default provision will not have “free \ntransferability of interest.” But if the LLC agreement allows majority consent for the transfer of all \nattributes, that also would satisfy the requirement that there not be free transferability of interests. Then \nwe get into the question of how to define “majority”: by number of members or by value of their \nmembership? And what if only the managing partners need to consent? Or if there are two classes of \nmembership and the transfer of interests in one class requires the consent of the other? The point is that \npeople keep pushing the boundaries to see how close their LLC can come to corporation-like status \nwithout being called a corporation.",

[2] (Here we see an example of the legislature allowing \nbusiness owners to externalize the risks of business operation.) More broadly, the success of the limited \nliability company attracted the attention of professionals like accountants, lawyers, and doctors who \nsought insulation from personal liability for the mistakes or malpractice of their partners. Their wish was \ngranted with the adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the limited liability \npartnership in the early 1990s. Most partnership law under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act applies \nto LLPs. \n \nCreation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n566 \nMembers of a partnership (only a majority is required) who want to form an LLP must file with the \nsecretary of state; the name of the firm must include “limited liability partnership” or “LLP” to notify the \npublic that its members will not stand personally for the firm’s liabilities. \n \nLiability \nAs noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to afford insulation from liability for its members. A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed limited liability for negligent acts and retained \nunlimited liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts by partners, \nemployees, or agents. The second wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability, leaving only \nbreaches of ordinary contract obligation. These two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. \nThe third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection—no unlimited liability at all. Needless to \nsay, the full-shield type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still, however, many statutes \nrequire specified amounts of professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain fully liable for their \nown negligence or for wrongful acts of those in the LLP whom they supervise. \n \nIn other respects, the LLP is like a partnership. \n \n \nLimited Liability Limited Partnerships \nThe progress toward achieving limited liability continues. A \nlimited liability limited partnership (LLLP, or triple LP) is the latest invention. It is a limited \npartnership that has invoked the LLLP provisions of its state partnership law by filing with a specified \npublic official the appropriate documentation to become an LLLP. This form completely eliminates the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n567 \nautomatic personal liability of the general partner for partnership obligations and, under most statutes, \nalso eliminates the “control rule” liability exposure for all limited partners. It is noteworthy that California \nlaw does not allow for an LLLP to be formed in California; however, it does recognize LLLPs formed in \nother states. A “foreign” LLLP doing business in California must register with the secretary of state. As of \nFebruary 2011, twenty-one states allow the formation of LLLPs. \n \nThe 2001 revision of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) provides this definition of an LLLP: \n“‘Limited liability limited partnership’…means a limited partnership whose certificate of limited \npartnership states that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.” [4] Section 404(c) \ngets to the point: “An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a \nlimited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation \nof the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5]",

                    "question": "What is the difference between a partnership and a limited liability partnership?",
                    "answer": "A limited liability partnership is a type of partnership in which the personal liability of the partners is limited to their own investment in the partnership. In a traditional partnership, all partners are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. This means that if the partnership is sued or faces financial difficulties, the partners can be held personally responsible for the debts of the partnership. In a limited liability partnership, however, the partners are only liable for their own investments in the partnership. This means that if the partnership is sued or faces financial difficulties, the partners are not personally liable for the debts of the partnership beyond their own investments. This can provide a significant level of protection for the partners and can make it easier for them to attract investors and obtain financing. Limited liability partnerships are typically used by professionals such as lawyers, accountants, and doctors, who may face significant liability risks in their work. However, limited liability partnerships can also be used by other types of businesses, such as real estate development firms, to protect their partners from personal liability."

                    "question": "What is the purpose of a limited liability company?",
                    "answer": "A limited liability company (LLC) is a type of business entity that combines the benefits of a corporation and a partnership. An LLC is a separate legal entity from its owners, which means that the owners, known as members, are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the LLC. This can provide a significant level of protection for the members and can make it easier for them to attract investors and obtain financing. In addition, an LLC can be managed by its members or by a manager, which can provide flexibility in how the business is run. The members of an LLC are also not subject to double taxation, which can save the LLC money on taxes. Overall, an LLC can be a good choice for businesses that want the benefits of a corporation without the complexity and expense of a corporation."

Those claims stemmed from plaintiffs’ contention that Topel, who plaintiffs alleged was the \nsole manager and owner of Thinktank, knew or should have known of Thinktank’s involuntary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n573 \ndissolution, but nonetheless continued to conduct business as Thinktank from May 30, 2002, through the \nend of August 2002.

Thinktank then failed to pay plaintiffs for work they had \nperformed.… \n \nOn September 2, 2003, the circuit granted plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings against \nThinktank.

Relying on [Citation], plaintiffs contended that Topel, as a principal of \nThinktank, an LLC, had a legal status similar to a shareholder or director of a corporation, who courts \nhave found liable for a dissolved corporation’s debts. Thus, plaintiffs argued that Topel was personally \nliable for Thinktank’s debts.… \n…The circuit court denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment against Topel.…In doing so, the \ncircuit court acknowledged that Topel continued to do business as Thinktank after its dissolution and that \nthe contractual obligations at issue were incurred after the dissolution. \n \nHowever…the court entered a final order dismissing all of plaintiffs’ claims against Topel with \nprejudice.…The court stated in pertinent part: \n \nBased upon the Court’s…finding that the Illinois Legislature did not intend to hold a member of a \nLimited Liability Company liable for debts incurred after the Limited Liability Company had \nbeen involuntarily dissolved, the Court finds that all of Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Topel \nwithin the Complaint fail as a matter of law, as they are premised upon Defendant Topel’s alleged \npersonal liability for obligations incurred in the name of Thinktank LLC after it had been \ninvoluntarily dissolved by the Illinois Secretary of State.",

Comprehend the historical significance of corporate formation. \n2. Learn about key court decisions and their effect on interstate commerce and corporate formation. \n3. Become acquainted with how states formed their corporate laws. \n \n \nA Fixture of Every Major Legal System \nLike partnership, the corporation is an ancient concept, recognized in the Code of Hammurabi, and to \nsome degree a fixture in every other major legal system since then. The first corporations were not \nbusiness enterprises; instead, they were associations for religious and governmental ends in which \nperpetual existence was a practical requirement. Thus until relatively late in legal history, kings, popes, \nand jurists assumed that corporations could be created only by political or ecclesiastical authority and that \ncorporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711).

These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total",

Distinguish basic aspects of partnership formation from those of corporate formation. \n2. Explain ownership and control in partnerships and in publicly held and closely held corporations. \n3. Know how partnerships and corporations are taxed. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n591 \nLet us assume that three people have already formed a partnership to run a bookstore business. Bob \nhas contributed $80,000. Carol has contributed a house in which the business can lawfully operate. \nTed has contributed his services; he has been managing the bookstore, and the business is showing a \nslight profit. A friend has been telling them that they ought to incorporate. What are the major \nfactors they should consider in reaching a decision? \n \nEase of Formation \nPartnerships are easy to form. If the business is simple enough and the partners are few, the agreement \nneed not even be written down. Creating a corporation is more complicated because formal documents \nmust be placed on file with public authorities. \n \nOwnership and Control \nAll general partners have equal rights in the management and conduct of the business. By contrast, \nownership and control of corporations are, in theory, separated. In the publicly held corporation, \nwhich has many shareholders, the separation is real. Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of \nshares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of \nstock. It is difficult under the best of circumstances for shareholders to exert any form of control over \ncorporate operations. However, in the closely held corporation, which has few shareholders, the \nofficers or senior managers are usually also the shareholders, so the separation of ownership and control \nmay be less pronounced or even nonexistent. \n \nTransferability of Interests \nTransferability of an interest in a partnership is a problem because a transferee cannot become a member \nunless all partners consent. The problem can be addressed and overcome in the partnership \nagreement. Transfer of interest in a corporation, through a sale of stock, is much easier; but for the \nstock of a small corporation, there might not be a market or there might be contractual restrictions on \ntransfer. \n \nFinancing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n592 \nPartners have considerable flexibility in financing. They can lure potential investors by offering interests \nin profits and, in the case of general partnerships, control. Corporations can finance by selling freely \ntransferable stock to the public or by incurring debt. Different approaches to the financing of corporations \nare discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". \n \nTaxation \nThe partnership is a conduit for income and is not taxed as a separate entity. Individual partners are \ntaxed, and although limited by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, they can deduct partnership losses. Corporate \nearnings, on the other hand, are subject to double taxation. The corporation is first taxed on its own \nearnings as an entity. Then, when profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, the \nshareholders are taxed again. (A small corporation, with no more than one hundred shareholders, can \nelect S corporation status. Because S corporations are taxed as partnerships, they avoid double taxation.) \nHowever, incorporating brings several tax benefits. For example, the corporation can take deductions for \nlife, medical, and disability insurance coverage for its employees, whereas partners or sole proprietors \ncannot. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nPartnerships are easier to form than corporations, especially since no documents are required. General \npartners share both ownership and control, but in publicly held corporations, these functions are separated. \nAdditional benefits for a partnership include flexibility in financing, single taxation, and the ability to deduct \nlosses.

Know what rights a corporate “person” and a natural person have in common. \n2. Recognize when a corporate “veil” is pierced and shareholder liability is imposed. \n3. Identify other instances when a shareholder will be held personally liable. \n \nIn comparing partnerships and corporations, there is one additional factor that ordinarily tips the balance \nin favor of incorporating: the corporation is a legal entity in its own right, one that can provide a “veil” \nthat protects its shareholders from personal liability. \n \nFigure 14.1 The Corporate Veil \n \n \nThis crucial factor accounts for the development of much of corporate law. Unlike the individual actor in \nthe legal system, the corporation is difficult to deal with in conventional legal terms. The business of the \nsole proprietor and the sole proprietor herself are one and the same. When a sole proprietor makes a \ndecision, she risks her own capital. When the managers of a corporation take a corporate action, they are \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n594 \nrisking the capital of others—the shareholders. Thus accountability is a major theme in the system of law \nconstructed to cope with legal entities other than natural persons. \n \n \n \nThe Basic Rights of the Corporate “Person” \nTo say that a corporation is a “person” does not automatically describe what its rights are, for the \ncourts have not accorded the corporation every right guaranteed a natural person. Yet the Supreme Court \nrecently affirmed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) that the government may not \nsuppress the First Amendment right of political speech because the speaker is a corporation rather than a \nnatural person. According to the Court, “No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the \npolitical speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” [1] \n \nThe courts have also concluded that corporations are entitled to the essential constitutional protections of \ndue process and equal protection. They are also entitled to Fourth Amendment protection against \nunreasonable search and seizure; in other words, the police must have a search warrant to enter corporate \npremises and look through files. Warrants, however, are not required for highly regulated industries, such \nas those involving liquor or guns. The Double Jeopardy Clause applies to criminal prosecutions of \ncorporations: an acquittal cannot be appealed nor can the case be retried. For purposes of the federal \ncourts’ diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of both the state in which it is \nincorporated and the state in which it has its principal place of business (often, the corporate \n“headquarters”). \n \nUntil relatively recently, few cases had tested the power of the state to limit the right of corporations to \nspend their own funds to speak the “corporate mind.” Most cases involving corporate free speech address \nadvertising, and few states have enacted laws that directly impinge on the freedom of companies to \nadvertise. But those states that have done so have usually sought to limit the ability of corporations to \nsway voters in public referenda. In 1978, the Supreme Court finally confronted the issue head on in First \nNational Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (Section 14.7.1 \"Limiting a Corporation’s First Amendment Rights\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n595 \nThe ruling in Bellotti was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. In Citizens United, the Court struck down the part of the McCain-Feingold Act [2] that \nprohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting \n“electioneering communications.” \nAbsence of Rights \nCorporations lack certain rights that natural persons possess. For example, corporations do not have the \nprivilege against self-incrimination guaranteed for natural persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation. As we explore \nin Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign Corporations, and \nCorporate Dissolution\", corporations are not citizens under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the \nConstitution, so that the states can discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations. And the \ncorporation is not entitled to federal review of state criminal convictions, as are many individuals. \n \nPiercing the Corporate Veil \nGiven the importance of the corporate entity as a veil that limits shareholder liability, it is important to",

Define the two types of business corporations. \n \n \n \nNonprofit Corporations \nOne of the four major classifications of corporations is the nonprofit corporation (also called not-for-\nprofit corporation). It is defined in the American Bar Association’s Model Non-Profit Corporation Act as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n599 \n“a corporation no part of the income of which is distributable to its members, directors or officers.” \nNonprofit corporations may be formed under this law for charitable, educational, civil, religious, social, \nand cultural purposes, among others. \n \nPublic Corporations \nThe true public corporation is a governmental entity. It is often called a municipal corporation, to \ndistinguish it from the publicly held corporation, which is sometimes also referred to as a “public” \ncorporation, although it is in fact private (i.e., it is not governmental). Major cities and counties, and many \ntowns, villages, and special governmental units, such as sewer, transportation, and public utility \nauthorities, are incorporated. These corporations are not organized for profit, do not have shareholders, \nand operate under different statutes than do business corporations. \n \nProfessional Corporations \nUntil the 1960s, lawyers, doctors, accountants, and other professionals could not practice their \nprofessions in corporate form. This inability, based on a fear of professionals’ being subject to the \ndirection of the corporate owners, was financially disadvantageous. Under the federal income tax laws \nthen in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During \nthe 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax \nbenefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a professional corporation just as it would \nany other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of \ntax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension.

There are two broad types of \nbusiness corporations: publicly held (or public) and closely held (or close or private) corporations. Again, \nboth types are private in the sense that they are not governmental. \n \nThe publicly held corporation is one in which stock is widely held or available for wide public distribution \nthrough such means as trading on a national or regional stock exchange. Its managers, if they are also \nowners of stock, usually constitute a small percentage of the total number of shareholders and hold a \nsmall amount of stock relative to the total shares outstanding. Few, if any, shareholders of public \ncorporations know their fellow shareholders. \n \nBy contrast, the shareholders of the closely held corporation are fewer in number. Shares in a closely held \ncorporation could be held by one person, and usually by no more than thirty. Shareholders of the closely \nheld corporation often share family ties or have some other association that permits each to know the \nothers. \n \nThough most closely held corporations are small, no economic or legal reason prevents them from being \nlarge. Some are huge, having annual sales of several billion dollars each. Roughly 90 percent of US \ncorporations are closely held. \n \nThe giant publicly held companies with more than $1 billion in assets and sales, with initials such as IBM \nand GE, constitute an exclusive group. Publicly held corporations outside this elite class fall into two \nbroad (nonlegal) categories: those that are quoted on stock exchanges and those whose stock is too widely \ndispersed to be called closely held but is not traded on exchanges. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n601 \nThere are four major classifications of corporations: (1) nonprofit, (2) municipal, (3) professional, and (4) \nbusiness.

Why did professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, and accountants, wait so long to incorporate? \n2. Distinguish a publicly held corporation from a closely held one. \n3.

If the owners of a business decide to incorporate after weighing the pros and cons of \nincorporation, they need to take the steps explained in this section. \n \nThe Corporate Charter \nFunction of the Charter \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n602 \nThe ultimate goal of the incorporation process is issuance of a corporate charter. The term used for the \ndocument varies from state to state. Most states call the basic document filed in the appropriate public \noffice the “articles of incorporation” or “certificate of incorporation,” but there are other variations. There \nis no legal significance to these differences in terminology. \n \nChartering is basically a state prerogative. Congress has chartered several enterprises, including national \nbanks (under the National Banking Act), federal savings and loan associations, national farm loan \nassociations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted.

The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware. In addition, Delaware’s Court of Chancery, \na court of equity, is renowned as a premier business court with a well-established body of corporate law, \nthereby affording a business a certain degree of predictability in judicial decision making. \n \nThe Promoter \nFunctions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n604 \nOnce the state of incorporation has been selected, it is time for promoters, the midwives of the \nenterprise, to go to work.

Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed. If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable. \n \nNow assume that the corporation is formed on October 15, and on October 18 it formally accepts all the \ncontracts that Bob signed prior to October 15. Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance. Under RMBCA, Section 6.20, however, a \nsubscription for shares is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement itself provides \notherwise or unless all the subscribers consent to revocation. In many states that have not adopted the \nmodel act, the contract rule applies and the offer is always revocable. Other states use various common-\nlaw devices to prevent revocation. For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles of incorporation typically include the \nfollowing: the corporate name; the address of the corporation’s initial registered office; the period of the \ncorporation’s duration (usually perpetual); the company’s purposes; the total number of shares, the \nclasses into which they are divided, and the par value of each; the limitations and rights of each class of \nshareholders; the authority of the directors to establish preferred or special classes of stock; provisions for \npreemptive rights; provisions for the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation, including any \nprovision restricting the transfer of shares; the number of directors constituting the initial board of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n606 \ndirectors and the names and addresses of initial members; and the name and address of each \nincorporator.

Bestfoods \n113 F.3d 572 (1998) \n \nSOUTER, JUSTICE \n \nThe United States brought this action under §107(a)(2) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) against, among others, respondent CPC International, \nInc., the parent corporation of the defunct Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II), for the costs of cleaning up industrial \nwaste generated by Ott II’s chemical plant. Section 107(a)(2) authorizes suits against, among others, “any \nperson who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.” The trial \nfocused on whether CPC, as a parent corporation, had “owned or operated” Ott II’s plant within the \nmeaning of §107(a)(2). The District Court said that operator liability may attach to a parent corporation \nboth indirectly, when the corporate veil can be pierced under state law, and directly, when the parent has \nexerted power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in, and exercising control over, the \nsubsidiary’s business during a period of hazardous waste disposal. Applying that test, the court held CPC \nliable because CPC had selected Ott II’s board of directors and populated its executive ranks with CPC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n615 \nofficials, and another CPC official had played a significant role in shaping Ott II’s environmental \ncompliance policy. \nThe Sixth Circuit reversed. Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1. When (but only when) the corporate veil may be pierced, a parent corporation may be charged with \nderivative CERCLA liability for its subsidiary’s actions in operating a polluting facility. It is a general \nprinciple of corporate law that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of \nanother corporation’s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. CERCLA does not purport to reject \nthis bedrock principle, and the Government has indeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as \nan owner or an operator under §107(a)(2) simply because its subsidiary owns or operates a polluting \nfacility. But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary \nrelationship as well as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for \nthe corporation’s conduct when, inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish \ncertain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud, on the shareholder’s behalf. CERCLA does not purport to \nrewrite this well-settled rule, either, and against this venerable common-law backdrop, the congressional \nsilence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U.S. 256, 266-267. \nCERCLA’s failure to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership \ndemands application of the rule that, to abrogate a common-law principle, a statute must speak directly to \nthe question addressed by the common law. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n616 \n \n2. A corporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of its \nsubsidiary’s facility may be held directly liable in its own right under §107(a)(2) as an operator of the \nfacility. \n \n(a) Derivative liability aside, CERCLA does not bar a parent corporation from direct liability for its own \nactions. Under the plain language of §107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly \nliable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even if that person is the parent corporation \nof the facility’s owner. Because the statute does not define the term “operate,” however, it is difficult to \ndefine actions sufficient to constitute direct parental “operation.” In the organizational sense obviously \nintended by CERCLA, to “operate” a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or \nconduct the affairs of the facility.

Review the advantages and disadvantages to the corporation of issuing bonds. \n \n \nBasics of Corporate Bonds \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n634 \nCorporations often raise money through debt. This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration. There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. In \nbankruptcy, the bondholders have a liquidation preference over investors with ownership—that is, the \nshareholders. Additionally, being highly leveraged can be risky: a corporation could load itself up with too \nmuch debt and not be able to make its interest payments or face-value payments. Another major \nconsideration is the “cost” of debt. When interest rates are high, corporations must offer higher interest \nrates to attract investors. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations often raise capital and finance operations through debt. Bank loans are one source of debt, but \nlarge corporations often turn to bonds for financing. Bonds are an IOU, whereby the corporation sells a bond \nto an investor; agrees to make periodic interest payments, such as 5 percent of the face value of the bond \nannually; and at the maturity date, pays the face value of the bond to the investor. There are several \nadvantages to the corporation in using bonds as a financial instrument: the corporation does not give up \nownership in the firm, it attracts more investors, it increases its flexibility, and it can deduct the interest \npayments from corporate taxes. Bonds do have some disadvantages: they are debt and can hurt a highly \nleveraged company, the corporation must pay the interest and principal when they are due, and the \nbondholders have a preference over shareholders upon liquidation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Venture capital investors typically provide capital in exchange for an ownership stake in the company and often provide additional support and guidance to the company's management team. Private equity and venture capital are similar in that they both involve the investment of capital in privately held companies. However, private equity investments are typically made in companies that are more established and have a proven track record, while venture capital investments are typically made in companies that are in the early stages of growth and have a higher risk of failure.

A corporation may have too much debt and would prefer to \nraise funds through a sale of stock rather than increasing its debt. The total costs of selling stock are often \nlower than financing through debt: the IPO may be expensive, but debt costs can vastly exceed the IPO \ncost because of the interest payments on the debt. Also, IPOs are a popular method of increasing a firm’s \nexposure, bringing the corporation many more investors and increasing its public image. Issuing stock is \nalso beneficial for the corporation because the corporation can use shares as compensation; for example, \nemployment compensation may be in the form of stock, such as in an employee stock ownership plan. \nInvestors also seek common stock, whether in an IPO or in the secondary market. While common stock is \na riskier investment than a bond, stock ownership can have tremendous upside—after all, the sky is the \nlimit on the price of a stock. On the other hand, there is the downside: the price of the stock can plummet, \ncausing the shareholder significant monetary loss. \n \nCertainly, an IPO has some disadvantages. Ownership is diluted: BCT had very few owners before its IPO \nbut may have millions of owners after the IPO. As mentioned, an IPO can be expensive. An IPO can also \nbe undervalued: the corporation and its investment banks may undervalue the IPO stock price, causing \nthe corporation to lose out on the difference between its determined price and the market price. Being a \npublic corporation also places the corporation under the purview of the SEC and requires ongoing \ndisclosures. Timing can be problematic: the registration review process can take several weeks. The stock \nmarkets can change drastically over that waiting period. Furthermore, the offering could have insufficient \npurchasers to raise sufficient funds; that is, the public might not have enough interest in purchasing the \ncompany’s stock to bring in sufficient funds to the corporation. Finally, a firm that goes public releases \ninformation that is available to the public, which could be useful to competitors (trade secrets, \ninnovations, new technology, etc.). \n \nAs mentioned, one of the main disadvantages of going public is the SEC review and disclosure \nrequirements. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs most secondary market transactions. The \n1934 act places certain requirements on corporations that have sold securities. Both the 1933 and 1934 \nacts require corporations to disseminate information to the public and/or its investors. These \nrequirements were strengthened after the collapse of Enron in 2001. The SEC realized that its disclosure \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n645 \nrequirements were not strong enough, as demonstrated by the accounting tricks and downfall of Enron \nand its accountant, Arthur Andersen. [1] \n \nAs a result of Enron’s accounting scandal, as well as problems with other corporations, Congress \ntightened the noose by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. [2] This act increased the disclosure of \nfinancial information, increased transparency, and required the dissemination of information about what \na corporation was doing. For example, Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that a corporation’s chief \nexecutive officer and chief financial officer certify annual and quarterly reports and state that the report \ndoes not contain any material falsehoods and that the financial data accurately reflect the corporation’s \ncondition. \n \nNature of the Consideration \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. While cash is commonly used to purchase \nstock, a stock purchaser may pay with something other than cash, such as property, whether tangible or \nintangible, or services or labor performed for the corporation. In most states, promissory notes and \ncontracts for future services are not lawful forms of consideration. The case United Steel Industries, Inc. \nv. Manhart, (see Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), illustrates the problems that can \narise when services or promises of future delivery are intended as payment for stock. \n \n \nEvaluating the Consideration: Watered Stock \nIn United Steel Industries (Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), assume that Griffitts’s \nlegal services had been thought by the corporation to be worth $6,000 but in fact were worth $1,000, and \nthat he had received stock with par value of $6,000 (i.e., 6,000 shares of $1 par value stock) in exchange \nfor his services. Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value? This is the problem of watered stock: the inflated consideration is in fact less \nthan par value. The term itself comes from the ancient fraud of farmers and ranchers who increased the \nweight of their cattle (also known as stock) by forcing them to ingest excess water. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n646",

As noted near the end of the United Steel \nIndustries case, in the absence of fraud, “the judgment of the board of directors ‘as to the value of \nconsideration received for shares’ is conclusive.” In other words, if the directors or shareholders conclude \nin good faith that the consideration does fairly reflect par value, then the stock is not watered and the \nstock buyer cannot be assessed for the difference. This is in line with the business judgment rule, \ndiscussed in Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\". If the directors concluded in good faith \nthat the consideration provided by Griffitts’s services accurately reflected the value of the shares, they \nwould not be liable. The minority approach is the true value rule: the consideration must in fact equal par \nvalue by an objective standard at the time the shares are issued, regardless of the board’s good-faith \njudgment. \n \nA shareholder may commence a derivative lawsuit (a suit by a shareholder, on behalf of the corporation, \noften filed against the corporation; see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"). In a watered \nstock lawsuit, the derivative suit is filed against a shareholder who has failed to pay full consideration \nunder either rule to recover the difference between the value received by the corporation and the par \nvalue. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations may raise funds through the sale of stock. This can be accomplished through an initial public \noffering (IPO)—the first time a corporation sells stock—or through stock sales after an IPO. The SEC is the \nregulatory body that oversees the sale of stock. A sale of stock has several benefits for the corporation, such \nas avoiding the use of debt, which can be much more expensive than selling stock. Stock sales also increase \nthe firm’s exposure and attract investors who prefer more risk than bonds. On the other hand, stock sales \nhave some disadvantages, namely, the dilution of ownership of the corporation. Also, the corporation may \nundervalue its shares, thus missing out on additional capital because of the undervaluation. Being a publicly \ntraded company places the corporation under the extensive requirements of the SEC and the 1933 and 1934 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n647 \nsecurities acts, such as shareholder meetings and annual financial reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act adds yet \nmore requirements that a corporation may wish to avoid. \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. Most investors will exchange money for stock. \nCertain forms of consideration are not permitted. Finally, a corporation may be liable if it sells watered stock, \nwhere consideration received by the corporation is less than the stock par value. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends \nThe law imposes certain limitations on cash or property dividends a corporation may disburse. Dividends \nmay not be paid if (1) the business is insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they become due), (2) \npaying dividends would make it insolvent, or (3) payment would violate a restriction in the articles of \nincorporation. Most states also restrict the funds available for distribution to those available in earned \nsurplus. Under this rule, a corporation that ran a deficit in the current year could still declare a dividend \nas long as the total earned surplus offset the deficit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n650 \nA few states—significantly, Delaware is one of them—permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current \nearnings and those of the immediately preceding year, both years taken as a single period, even if the \nbalance sheet shows a negative earned surplus. Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified",

[2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent. It may revoke a share \ndividend as long as the shares have not been issued. \n \nDiscretion of Directors to Pay Dividends \nWhen Directors Are Too Stingy \nIn every state, dividends are normally payable only at the discretion of the directors. Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders. A corporation may pay dividends \nthrough a variety of methods, although money and additional shares are the most common.

They may apply profits in payment of \nfloating or funded debts, or in development of the company’s business; and so long as they do not \nabuse their discretionary powers, or violate the company’s charter, the courts cannot interfere. \n \nBut it is clear that the agents of a corporation, and even the majority, cannot arbitrarily withhold \nprofits earned by the company, or apply them to any use which is not authorized by the \ncompany’s charter.… \n \nMr. Henry Ford is the dominant force in the business of the Ford Motor Company. No plan of operations \ncould be adopted unless he consented, and no board of directors can be elected whom he does not favor. \nOne of the directors of the company has no stock. One share was assigned to him to qualify him for the \nposition, but it is not claimed that he owns it. A business, one of the largest in the world, and one of the \nmost profitable, has been built up. It employs many men, at good pay. \n \n“My ambition,” said Mr. Ford, “is to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this \nindustrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their \nhomes. To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business.” \n \n“With regard to dividends, the company paid sixty per cent on its capitalization of two million \ndollars, or $1,200,000, leaving $58,000,000 to reinvest for the growth of the company. This is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n660 \nMr. Ford’s policy at present, and it is understood that the other stockholders cheerfully accede to \nthis plan.” \n \nHe had made up his mind in the summer of 1916 that no dividends other than the regular dividends \nshould be paid, “for the present.” \n \n“Q. For how long? Had you fixed in your mind any time in the future, when you were going to \npay— \n“A. No. \n“Q. That was indefinite in the future? \n“A. That was indefinite, yes, sir.” \n \nThe record, and especially the testimony of Mr. Ford, convinces that he has to some extent the attitude \ntowards shareholders of one who has dispensed and distributed to them large gains and that they should \nbe content to take what he chooses to give. His testimony creates the impression, also, that he thinks the \nFord Motor Company has made too much money, has had too large profits, and that although large profits \nmight be still earned, a sharing of them with the public, by reducing the price of the output of the \ncompany, ought to be undertaken. We have no doubt that certain sentiments, philanthropic and altruistic, \ncreditable to Mr. Ford, had large influence in determining the policy to be pursued by the Ford Motor \nCompany—the policy which has been herein referred to. \n \n* * * \n \nThe difference between an incidental humanitarian expenditure of corporate funds for the benefit of the \nemployees, like the building of a hospital for their use and the employment of agencies for the betterment \nof their condition, and a general purpose and plan to benefit mankind at the expense of others, is obvious. \nThere should be no confusion (of which there is evidence) of the duties which Mr. Ford conceives that he \nand the stockholders owe to the general public and the duties which in law he and his codirectors owe to \nprotesting, minority stockholders. A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n661 \nprofit of the stockholders.

In view of the fact that the selling price of products may be increased at any \ntime, the ultimate results of the larger business cannot be certainly estimated.

Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3. The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670 \nSuppose an incorporated luncheon club refuses to admit women as club members or guests. What \nhappens if this action is ultra vires? Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. (see Section 16.5.1 \"Ultra Vires \nActs\"), focuses on this issue. An ultra vires act is not necessarily criminal or tortious. However, every \ncrime and tort is in some sense ultra vires because a corporation never has legal authority to commit \ncrimes or torts. They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent. An additional dilemma was that society could not \nliterally imprison a corporation. Modern law is not so constricting. Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions. But these \ncases are extremely rare. \n \nThat a corporation is found guilty of a violation of the law does not excuse company officials who \nauthorized or carried out the illegal act. They, too, can be prosecuted and sent to jail. Legal punishments \nare being routinely added to the newer regulatory statutes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and the Toxic Substances Control Act—although prosecution depends mainly on whether and where a \nparticular administration wishes to spend its enforcement dollars. Additionally, state prosecuting \nattorneys have become more active in filing criminal charges against management when employees are \ninjured or die on the job. For instance, a trial court judge in Chicago sentenced a company president, \nplant manager, and foreman to twenty-five years in prison after they were convicted of murder following \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n671 \nthe death of a worker as a result of unsafe working conditions at a plant; [3] the punishments were later \noverturned, but the three pled guilty several years later and served shorter sentences of varying duration. \n \nMore recently, prosecutors have been expanding their prosecutions of corporations and developing \nmethodologies to evaluate whether a corporation has committed a criminal act; for example, US Deputy \nAttorney General Paul McNulty revised “Principles of Federal Prosecutions of Business Organizations” in \n2006 to further guide prosecutors in indicting corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\"). [4] This stands in contrast to the general rule that an individual must \nknow, or should know, of a violation of the law in order to be liable. Strict liability does not require",

The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust. The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting \nrecords) must also have a “proper purpose,” such as to determine the propriety of the company’s dividend \npolicy or to ascertain the company’s true financial worth. Improper purposes include uncovering trade \nsecrets for sale to a competitor or compiling mailing lists for personal business purposes. A shareholder’s \nmotivation is an important factor in determining whether the purpose is proper, as the courts attempt to \nbalance the rights of both the shareholders and the corporation. For example, a Minnesota court applied \nDelaware law in finding that a shareholder’s request to view the corporation’s shareholder ledger to \nidentify shareholders and communicate with them about the corporation’s involvement in the Vietnam \nWar was improper. A desire to communicate with the other corporate shareholders was found to be \ninsufficient to compel inspection. [2] Contrast that finding with a Delaware court’s finding that a \nshareholder had a proper purpose in requesting a corporation’s shareholder list in order to communicate \nwith them about the economic risks of the firm’s involvement in Angola.

Carol vehemently objects because her percentage of ownership will decline. She goes \nto court seeking an injunction against the sale or an order permitting her to purchase 200 of the shares \n(she currently has 20 percent of the total). How should the court rule? \n \nThe answer depends on the statutory provision dealing with preemptive rights—that is, the right of a \nshareholder to be protected from dilution of her percentage of ownership. In some states, shareholders \nhave no preemptive rights unless expressly declared in the articles of incorporation, while other states \ngive shareholders preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation deny it. Preemptive rights were \nonce strongly favored, but they are increasingly disappearing, especially in large publicly held companies \nwhere ownership is already highly diluted. \n \nDerivative Actions \nSuppose Carol discovers that Ted has been receiving kickbacks from publishers and has been splitting the \nproceeds with Bob. When at a directors’ meeting, Carol demands that the corporation file suit to recover \nthe sums they pocketed, but Bob and Ted outvote her. Carol has another remedy. She can file a \nderivative action against them. A derivative lawsuit is one brought on behalf of the corporation by a \nshareholder when the directors refuse to act. Although the corporation is named as a defendant in the \nsuit, the corporation itself is the so-called real party in interest—the party entitled to recover if the \nplaintiff wins. \n \nWhile derivative actions are subject to abuse by plaintiffs’ attorneys seeking settlements that pay their \nfees, safeguards have been built into the law. At least ninety days before starting a derivative action, for \ninstance, shareholders must demand in writing that the corporation take action. Shareholders may not \ncommence derivative actions unless they were shareholders at the time of the wrongful act. Derivative \nactions may be dismissed if disinterested directors decide that the proceeding is not in the best interests \nof the corporation.

In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the \ncorporation. The rule encompasses the chance of acquiring another corporation, purchasing property, and \nlicensing or marketing patents or products. This duty of disclosure was placed into legal lexicon by Judge \nCardozo in 1928 when he stated that business partners owe more than a general sense of honor among \none another; rather, they owe “the punctilio of honor most sensitive.” [3] Thus when a corporate \nopportunity arises, business partners must disclose the opportunity, and a failure to disclose is \ndishonest—a breach of the duty of loyalty. \n \nWhether a particular opportunity is a corporate opportunity can be a delicate question. For example, BCT \nowns a golf course and a country club. A parcel of land adjacent to their course comes on the market for \nsale, but BCT takes no action. Two BCT officers purchase the land personally, later informing the BCT \nboard about the purchase and receiving board ratification of their purchase. Then BCT decides to \nliquidate and enters into an agreement with the two officers to sell both parcels of land. A BCT \nshareholder brings a derivative suit against the officers, alleging that purchasing the adjacent land stole a \ncorporate opportunity. The shareholder would be successful in his suit. In considering Farber v. Servan \nLand Co., Inc., [4] a case just like the one described, the Farber court laid out four factors in considering \nwhether a corporate opportunity has been usurped: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n687 \n1. Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand. Put another way, a director must make a reasonable \neffort to inform himself before making a decision, as discussed in the next paragraph. The director is not \nheld to a higher standard required of a specialist (finance, marketing) unless he is one. A director of a \nsmall, closely held corporation will not necessarily be held to the same standard as a director who is given \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n688 \na staff by a large, complex, diversified company. The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations",

The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to \nwhich we now turn. For further discussions of the business judgment rule, see Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, \nInc., [8] In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, [9] and Smith v. Van Gorkom. [10] \n \nIf a shareholder is not pleased by a director’s decision, that shareholder may file a derivative suit. The \nderivative suit may be filed by a shareholder on behalf of the corporation against directors or officers of \nthe corporation, alleging breach of their fiduciary obligations. However, a shareholder, as a prerequisite to \nfiling a derivative action, must first demand that the board of directors take action, as the actual party in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n690 \ninterest is the corporation, not the shareholder (meaning that if the shareholder is victorious in the \nlawsuit, it is actually the corporation that “wins”). If the board refuses, is its decision protected by the \nbusiness judgment rule? The general rule is that the board may refuse to file a derivative suit and will be \nprotected by the business judgment rule. And even when a derivative suit is filed, directors can be \nprotected by the business judgment rule for decisions even the judge considers to have been poorly made. \nSee In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, (see Section 16.5.2 \"Business Judgment Rule\"). \n \nIn a battle for control of a corporation, directors (especially “inside” directors, who are employees of the \ncorporation, such as officers) often have an inherent self-interest in preserving their positions, which can \nlead them to block mergers that the shareholders desire and that may be in the firm’s best interest. As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum, [11] for instance, the court held that directors who adopt a defensive \nmechanism “must show that they had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy \nand effectiveness existed.…[T]hey satisfy that burden ‘by showing good faith and reasonable \ninvestigation.’” The business judgment rule clearly does not protect every decision of the board. \nThe Unocal court developed a test for the board: the directors may only work to prevent a takeover when \nthey can demonstrate a threat to the policies of the corporation and that any defensive measures taken to \nprevent the takeover were reasonable and proportional given the depth of the threat. The Unocal test was \nmodified further by requiring a finding, before a court steps in, that the actions of a board were coercive, a \nstep back toward the business judgment rule. [12] \n \nIn a widely publicized case, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of Time, Inc. met \nthe Unocal test—that the board reasonably concluded that a tender offer by Paramount constituted a \nthreat and acted reasonably in rejecting Paramount’s offer and in merging with Warner \nCommunications. [13] \n \nThe specific elements of the fiduciary duties are not spelled out in stone. For example, the Delaware \ncourts have laid out three factors to examine when determining whether a duty of care has been \nbreached: [14] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n691 \n \n1. The directors knew, or should have known, that legal breaches were occurring. \n2. The directors took no steps to prevent or resolve the situation. \n3. This failure caused the losses about which the shareholder is complaining in a derivative suit. \n \nThus the court expanded the duty of oversight (which is included under the umbrella of the duty of care; \nthese duties are often referred to as the Caremark duties). Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation.

The rule applies to all decisions made by directors in their official capacity, including decisions to enter into contracts, issue stock, or engage in other corporate activities. The rule is intended to protect directors from being second-guessed by shareholders or other interested parties who may have a different view of what is in the best interests of the corporation.

So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies. Second, they make it more difficult for \nshareholders to monitor the performance of a company’s board; measuring decisions against the single \ngoal of profit maximization is far easier than against the subjective goal of “balancing” a host of competing \ninterests. Constituency statutes run contrary to the concept of shareholders as owners, and of the \nfiduciary duties owed to them, effectively softening shareholder power. Nevertheless, since many states \nnow have constituency statutes, it is only reasonable to expect that the traditional doctrine holding \nshareholder interests paramount will begin to give way, even as the shareholders challenge new decisions \nby directors that favor communities, employees, and others with an important stake in the welfare of the \ncorporations with which they deal. For a more complete discussion of constituency statutes, see \n“Corporate Governance and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act: Corporate Constituency Statutes and Employee \nGovernance.” [17] \n \nMany modern corporations have begun to promote socially responsible behavior. While dumping toxic \nwaste out the back door of the manufacturing facility rather than expending funds to properly dispose of \nthe waste may result in an increase in value, the consequences of dumping the waste can be quite severe, \nwhether from fines from regulatory authorities or from public backlash. Corporate social responsibility \nresults from internal corporate policies that attempt to self-regulate and fulfill legal, ethical, and social \nobligations. Thus under corporate social responsibility, corporations may make donations to charitable \norganizations or build environmentally friendly or energy-efficient buildings. Socially irresponsible \nbehavior can be quite disastrous for a corporation. Nike, for example, was hit by consumer backlash due \nto its use of child labor in other countries, such as India and Malaysia. British Petroleum (BP) faced public \nanger as well as fines and lawsuits for a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This spill had serious \nconsequences for BP’s shareholders—BP stopped paying dividends, its stock price plummeted, and it had \nto set aside significant amounts of money to compensate injured individuals and businesses. \nMany businesses try to fulfill what is commonly called the triple bottom line, which is a focus on profits, \npeople, and the planet. For example, Ben and Jerry’s, the ice cream manufacturer, had followed a triple \nbottom line practice for many years. Nonetheless, when Ben and Jerry’s found itself the desired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n694 \nacquisition of several other businesses, it feared that a takeover of the firm would remove this focus, since \nfor some firms, there is only one bottom line—profits. Unilever offered $43.60 per share for Ben and \nJerry’s. Several Ben and Jerry’s insiders made a counteroffer at $38 per share, arguing that a lower price \nwas justified given the firm’s focus. Ultimately, in a case like this, the Revlon duties come into play: when \na corporation is for sale, corporate social responsibility goes out the window and only one bottom line \nexists—maximum shareholder value. In the case of Ben and Jerry’s, the company was acquired in 2000 \nfor $326 million by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch corporation that is the world’s largest consumer products \ncompany. \n \nSarbanes-Oxley and Other Modern Trends \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted following several accounting scandals, strengthens the duties \nowed by the board and other corporate officers.

Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law.

We perceive no substantive difference \nbetween the Court of Chancery’s 2003 definition of bad faith—a “conscious and intentional disregard [of] \nresponsibilities, adopting a we don’t care about the risks’ attitude…”—and its 2005 post-trial definition—\nan “intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities.” Both formulations \nexpress the same concept, although in slightly different language. \n \nThe most telling evidence that there is no substantive difference between the two formulations is that the \nappellants are forced to contrive a difference. Appellants assert that under the 2003 formulation, \n“directors violate their duty of good faith if they are making material decisions without adequate \ninformation and without adequate deliberation.” For that ipse dixit they cite no legal authority. That \ncomes as no surprise because their verbal effort to collapse the duty to act in good faith into the duty to act \nwith due care, is not unlike putting a rabbit into the proverbial hat and then blaming the trial judge for \nmaking the insertion. \n \n…The precise question is whether the Chancellor’s articulated standard for bad faith corporate fiduciary \nconduct—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities—is legally \ncorrect. In approaching that question, we note that the Chancellor characterized that definition as \n“anappropriate (although not the only) standard for determining whether fiduciaries have acted in good \nfaith.” That observation is accurate and helpful, because as a matter of simple logic, at least three different \ncategories of fiduciary behavior are candidates for the “bad faith” pejorative label. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n705 \nThe first category involves so-called “subjective bad faith,” that is, fiduciary conduct motivated by an \nactual intent to do harm. That such conduct constitutes classic, quintessential bad faith is a proposition so \nwell accepted in the liturgy of fiduciary law that it borders on axiomatic.…The second category of conduct, \nwhich is at the opposite end of the spectrum, involves lack of due care—that is, fiduciary action taken \nsolely by reason of gross negligence and without any malevolent intent. In this case, appellants assert \nclaims of gross negligence to establish breaches not only of director due care but also of the directors’ duty \nto act in good faith. Although the Chancellor found, and we agree, that the appellants failed to establish \ngross negligence, to afford guidance we address the issue of whether gross negligence (including a failure \nto inform one’s self of available material facts), without more, can also constitute bad faith.

The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del. C. § 145. To \noversimplify, subsections (a) and (b) of that statute permit a corporation to indemnify (inter alia) any \nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses…where \n(among other things): (i) that person is, was, or is threatened to be made a party to that action, suit or \nproceeding, and (ii) that person “acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be \nin or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.…” Thus, under Delaware statutory law a \ndirector or officer of a corporation can be indemnified for liability (and litigation expenses) incurred by \nreason of a violation of the duty of care, but not for a violation of the duty to act in good faith. \n \nSection 145, like Section 102(b)(7), evidences the intent of the Delaware General Assembly to afford \nsignificant protections to directors (and, in the case of Section 145, other fiduciaries) of Delaware \ncorporations. To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith. In our view it must be, for at least two reasons. \n \nFirst, the universe of fiduciary misconduct is not limited to either disloyalty in the classic sense (i.e., \npreferring the adverse self-interest of the fiduciary or of a related person to the interest of the \ncorporation) or gross negligence. Cases have arisen where corporate directors have no conflicting self-\ninterest in a decision, yet engage in misconduct that is more culpable than simple inattention or failure to \nbe informed of all facts material to the decision. To protect the interests of the corporation and its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n707 \nshareholders, fiduciary conduct of this kind, which does not involve disloyalty (as traditionally defined) \nbut is qualitatively more culpable than gross negligence, should be proscribed. A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

This body of federal law has assumed special importance in recent \nyears as the states have engaged in a race to the bottom in attempting to compete with Delaware’s \npermissive corporation law (see Chapter 14 \"Corporation: General Characteristics and Formation\"). \n \nWhat Is a Security? \nSecurities law questions are technical and complex and usually require professional counsel. For the \nnonlawyer, the critical question on which all else turns is whether the particular investment or document \nis a security. If it is, anyone attempting any transaction beyond the routine purchase or sale through a \nbroker should consult legal counsel to avoid the various civil and criminal minefields that the law has \nstrewn about. \n \nThe definition of security, which is set forth in the Securities Act of 1933, is comprehensive, but it does \nnot on its face answer all questions that financiers in a dynamic market can raise. Under Section 2(1) of \nthe act, “security” includes “any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, \ncertificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n715 \npreorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust \ncertificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral \nrights, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a ‘security,’ or any certificate of \ninterest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or \nright to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.” \n \nUnder this definition, an investment may not be a security even though it is so labeled, and it may actually \nbe a security even though it is called something else. For example, does a service contract that obligates \nsomeone who has sold individual rows in an orange orchard to cultivate, harvest, and market an orange \ncrop involve a security subject to regulation under federal law? Yes, said the Supreme Court in Securities \n& Exchange Commission v. W. J. Howey Co. [1] The Court said the test is whether “the person invests his \nmoney in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a \nthird party.” Under this test, courts have liberally interpreted “investment contract” and “certificate of \ninterest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement” to be securities interests in such property as real \nestate condominiums and cooperatives, commodity option contracts, and farm animals. \n \nThe Supreme Court ruled that notes that are not “investment contracts” under the Howey test can still be \nconsidered securities if certain factors are present, as discussed in Reves v. Ernst & Young, (see Section \n17.3.1 \"What Is a Security?\"). These factors include (1) the motivations prompting a reasonable seller and \nbuyer to enter into the transaction, (2) the plan of distribution and whether the instruments are \ncommonly traded for speculation or investment, (3) the reasonable expectations of the investing public, \nand (4) the presence of other factors that significantly reduce risk so as to render the application of the \nSecurities Act unnecessary. \n \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission \nFunctions \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is over half a century old, having been created by \nCongress in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It is an independent regulatory agency, subject to the \nrules of the Administrative Procedure Act (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The commission is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n716 \ncomposed of five members, who have staggered five-year terms. Every June 5, the term of one of the \ncommissioners expires.

Other disclosures included one member of the controlling \ngroup having spent four months in prison for conspiracy to commit securities fraud; that he and another \nprincipal were the subject of a New Mexico cease and desist order involving allegedly unregistered tax-\nsheltered securities; that the general partner, brother-in-law of one of the principals, had no experience in \nthe company’s proposed oil and gas operations (Petrogene planned to extract oil from plants by using \nradio frequencies); that one of the oils to be produced was potentially carcinogenic; and that the \nprincipals “stand to benefit substantially” whether or not the company fails and whether or not \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n718 \npurchasers of shares recovered any of their investment. The prospectus went on to list specific risks. \nDespite this daunting compilation of troublesome details, the SEC permitted the offering because all \ndisclosures were made (Wall Street Journal, December 29, 1981). It is the business of the marketplace, \nnot the SEC, to determine whether the risk is worth taking. \n \nThe SEC enforces securities laws through two primary federal acts: The Securities Act of 1933 and The \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. \n \nSecurities Act of 1933 \nGoals \nThe Securities Act of 1933 is the fundamental “truth in securities” law. Its two basic objectives, which \nare written in its preamble, are “to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in \ninterstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof.” \n \nRegistration \nThe primary means for realizing these goals is the requirement of registration. Before securities subject to \nthe act can be offered to the public, the issuer must file a registration statement and prospectus with \nthe SEC, laying out in detail relevant and material information about the offering as set forth in various \nschedules to the act. If the SEC approves the registration statement, the issuer must then provide any \nprospective purchaser with the prospectus. Since the SEC does not pass on the fairness of price or other \nterms of the offering, it is unlawful to state or imply in the prospectus that the commission has the power \nto disapprove securities for lack of merit, thereby suggesting that the offering is meritorious. \n \nThe SEC has prepared special forms for registering different types of issuing companies. All call for a \ndescription of the registrant’s business and properties and of the significant provisions of the security to \nbe offered, facts about how the issuing company is managed, and detailed financial statements certified by \nindependent public accountants. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n719 \nOnce filed, the registration and prospectus become public and are open for public inspection. Ordinarily, \nthe effective date of the registration statement is twenty days after filing. Until then, the offering may not \nbe made to the public. Section 2(10) of the act defines prospectus as any “notice, circular, advertisement, \nletter, or communication, written or by radio or television, which offers any security for sale or confirms \nthe sale of any security.” (An exception: brief notes advising the public of the availability of the formal \nprospectus.) The import of this definition is that any communication to the public about the offering of a \nsecurity is unlawful unless it contains the requisite information. \n \nThe SEC staff examines the registration statement and prospectus, and if they appear to be materially \nincomplete or inaccurate, the commission may suspend or refuse the effectiveness of the registration \nstatement until the deficiencies are corrected. Even after the securities have gone on sale, the agency has \nthe power to issue a stop order that halts trading in the stock. \n \nSection 5(c) of the act bars any person from making any sale of any security unless it is first registered. \nNevertheless, there are certain classes of exemptions from the registration requirement. Perhaps the most \nimportant of these is Section 4(3), which exempts “transactions by any person other than an issuer, \nunderwriter or dealer.” Section 4(3) also exempts most transactions of dealers. So the net is that trading \nin outstanding securities (the secondary market) is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of \n1933: you need not file a registration statement with the SEC every time you buy or sell securities through \na broker or dealer, for example.

This section makes these \ncriminal penalties specifically applicable to anyone who “willfully, in a registration statement filed under \nthis title, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be \nstated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.” \n \nSections 11 and 12 provide that anyone injured by false declarations in registration statements, \nprospectuses, or oral communications concerning the sale of the security—as well as anyone injured by \nthe unlawful failure of an issuer to register—may file a civil suit to recover the net consideration paid for \nthe security or for damages if the security has been sold. \n \nAlthough these civil penalty provisions apply only to false statements in connection with the registration \nstatement, prospectus, or oral communication, the Supreme Court held, in Case v. Borak, [2] that there is \nan “implied private right of action” for damages resulting from a violation of SEC rules under the act. \nThe Court’s ruling in Borak opened the courthouse doors to many who had been defrauded but were \npreviously without a practical remedy. \n \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 \nCompanies Covered \nThe Securities Act of 1933 is limited, as we have just seen, to new securities issues—that is \nthe primary market. The trading that takes place in the secondary market is far more significant, \nhowever. In a normal year, trading in outstanding stock totals some twenty times the value of new stock \nissues. \n \nTo regulate the secondary market, Congress enacted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This law, \nwhich created the SEC, extended the disclosure rationale to securities listed and registered for public \ntrading on the national securities exchanges. Amendments to the act have brought within its ambit every \ncorporation whose equity securities are traded over the counter if the company has at least $10 million in \nassets and five hundred or more shareholders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n721 \n \n \nReporting Proxy Solicitation \nAny company seeking listing and registration of its stock for public trading on a national exchange—or \nover the counter, if the company meets the size test—must first submit a registration application to both \nthe exchange and the SEC. The registration statement is akin to that filed by companies under the \nSecurities Act of 1933, although the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 calls for somewhat fewer disclosures. \nThereafter, companies must file annual and certain other periodic reports to update information in the \noriginal filing. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 also covers proxy solicitation. Whenever management, or a \ndissident minority, seeks votes of holders of registered securities for any corporate purpose, disclosures \nmust be made to the stockholders to permit them to vote yes or no intelligently. \n \nPenalties \nThe logic of the Borak case (discussed in Section 17.1.3 \"Securities Act of 1933\") also applies to this act, so \nthat private investors may bring suit in federal court for violations of the statute that led to financial \ninjury.

Today, every state has enacted a blue sky law, so called because its purpose is to \nprevent “speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of ‘blue sky.’” [3] The federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n722 \nSecurities Act of 1933, discussed in Section 17.1.3 \"Securities Act of 1933\", specifically preserves the \njurisdiction of states over securities. \nBlue sky laws are divided into three basic types of regulation. The simplest is that which prohibits fraud in \nthe sale of securities. Thus at a minimum, issuers cannot mislead investors about the purpose of the \ninvestment. All blue sky laws have antifraud provisions; some have no other provisions. The second type \ncalls for registration of broker-dealers, and the third type for registration of securities. Some state laws \nparallel the federal laws in intent and form of proceeding, so that they overlap; other blue sky laws \nempower state officials (unlike the SEC) to judge the merits of the offerings, often referred to as \nmerit review laws. As part of a movement toward deregulation, several states have recently modified or \neliminated merit provisions. \n \nMany of the blue sky laws are inconsistent with each other, making national uniformity difficult. In 1956, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Securities Act. \nIt has not been designed to reconcile the conflicting philosophies of state regulation but to take them into \naccount and to make the various forms of regulation as consistent as possible. States adopt various \nportions of the law, depending on their regulatory philosophies. The Uniform Securities Act has antifraud, \nbroker-dealer registration, and securities registration provisions. More recent acts have further increased \nuniformity. These include the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which preempted \ndiffering state philosophies with regard to registration of securities and regulation of brokers and \nadvisors, and the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which preempted state law \nsecurities fraud claims from being raised in class action lawsuits by investors. \n \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich is the largest amendment to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. \nThis amendment was enacted in response to the economic recession of the late 2000s for the following \npurposes: (1) to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and \ntransparency in the financial system, (2) to end “too big to fail” institutions, (3) to protect the American \ntaxpayer by ending bailouts, and (4) to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n723 \ninstitutions most affected by the regulatory changes include those involved in monitoring the financial \nsystem, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the SEC. Importantly, the \namendment ended the exemption for investment advisors who previously were not required to register \nwith the SEC because they had fewer than fifteen clients during the previous twelve months and did not \nhold out to the public as investment advisors. This means that in practice, numerous investment advisors, \nas well as hedge funds and private equity firms, are now subject to registration requirements.

World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., [1] the first accounting provisions \ncase brought to trial. \n \nInsider Trading \nCorporate insiders—directors, officers, or important shareholders—can have a substantial trading \nadvantage if they are privy to important confidential information. Learning bad news (such as financial \nloss or cancellation of key contracts) in advance of all other stockholders will permit the privileged few to \nsell shares before the price falls. Conversely, discovering good news (a major oil find or unexpected \nprofits) in advance gives the insider a decided incentive to purchase shares before the price rises. \nBecause of the unfairness to those who are ignorant of inside information, federal law \nprohibits insider trading. Two provisions of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act are \nparamount: Section 16(b) and 10(b). \n \nRecapture of Short-Swing Profits: Section 16(b) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n726 \nThe Securities Exchange Act assumes that any director, officer, or shareholder owning 10 percent or more \nof the stock in a corporation is using inside information if he or any family member makes a profit from \ntrading activities, either buying and selling or selling and buying, during a six-month period. Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits. The law applies to any company with more than $10 million in assets and at \nleast five hundred or more shareholders of any class of stock. \n \nSuppose that on January 1, Bob (a company officer) purchases one hundred shares of stock in BCT \nBookstore, Inc., for $60 a share. On September 1, he sells them for $100 a share. What is the result? Bob \nis in the clear, because his $4,000 profit was not realized during a six-month period. Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why? In August, Bob held one hundred shares of stock, and he did again on \nOctober 1—within a six-month period. His net gain on these transactions was $7,000 ($10,000 realized \non the sale less the $3,000 cost of the purchase). \n \nAs a consequence of Section 16(b) and certain other provisions, trading in securities by directors, officers, \nand large stockholders presents numerous complexities. For instance, the law requires people in this \nposition to make periodic reports to the SEC about their trades. As a practical matter, directors, officers, \nand large shareholders should not trade in their own company stock in the short run without legal advice. \n \nInsider Trading: Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits any person from using the mails or \nfacilities of interstate commerce “to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any \nsecurity…any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and \nregulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the \nprotection of investors.” In 1942, the SEC learned of a company president who misrepresented the \ncompany’s financial condition in order to buy shares at a low price from current stockholders. So the \ncommission adopted a rule under the authority of Section 10(b). Rule 10b-5, as it was dubbed, has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n727 \nremained unchanged for more than forty years and has spawned thousands of lawsuits and SEC \nproceedings.

On \nApril 12, an executive vice president of TGS issued a press release downplaying the discovery, asserting \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n728 \nthat the rumors greatly exaggerated the find and stating that more drilling would be necessary before \ncoming to any conclusions. Four days later, on April 16, TGS publicly announced that it had uncovered a \nstrike of 25 million tons of ore. In the months following this announcement, TGS stock doubled in value. \n \nThe SEC charged several TGS officers and directors with having purchased or told their friends, so-\ncalled tippees, to purchase TGS stock from November 12, 1963, through April 16, 1964, on the basis of \nmaterial inside information. The SEC also alleged that the April 12, 1964, press release was deceptive. The \nUS Court of Appeals, in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., [2] decided that the defendants who purchased the \nstock before the public announcement had violated Rule 10b-5. According to the court, “anyone in \npossession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is \ndisabled from disclosing to protect a corporate confidence, or he chooses not to do so, must abstain from \ntrading in or recommending the securities concerned while such inside information remains undisclosed.” \nOn remand, the district court ordered certain defendants to pay $148,000 into an escrow account to be \nused to compensate parties injured by the insider trading. \n \nThe court of appeals also concluded that the press release violated Rule 10b-5 if “misleading to the \nreasonable investor.” On remand, the district court held that TGS failed to exercise “due diligence” in \nissuing the release. Sixty-nine private damage actions were subsequently filed against TGS by \nshareholders who claimed they sold their stock in reliance on the release. The company settled most of \nthese suits in late 1971 for $2.7 million. \n \nFollowing the TGS episode, the Supreme Court refined Rule 10b-5 on several fronts. First, in Ernst & \nErnst v. Hochfelder, [3] the Court decided that proof of scienter—defined as “mental state embracing \nintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”—is required in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In \nother words, negligence alone will not result in Rule 10b-5 liability. The Court also held that scienter, \nwhich is an intentional act, must be established in SEC injunctive actions. [4] \n \nThe Supreme Court has placed limitations on the liability of tippees under Rule 10b-5. In 1980, the Court \nreversed the conviction of an employee of a company that printed tender offer and merger prospectuses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n729 \nUsing information obtained at work, the employee had purchased stock in target companies and later sold \nit for a profit when takeover attempts were publicly announced. In Chiarella v. United States, the Court \nheld that the employee was not an insider or a fiduciary and that “a duty to disclose under Section 10(b) \ndoes not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.” [5] Following Chiarella, the \nCourt ruled in Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission (see Section 17.3.2 \"Tippee Liability\"), that \ntippees are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing \nconfidential information and the tipper received a personal benefit from the disclosure. \n \nThe Supreme Court has also refined Rule 10b-5 as it relates to the duty of a company to \ndisclose material information, as discussed in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson (see Section 17.3.3 \"Duty to",

Petitioners claimed that Arthur Young violated these \nprinciples in an effort to inflate the assets and net worth of the Co-Op. Petitioners maintained that, had \nArthur Young properly treated the plant in its audits, they would not have purchased demand notes \nbecause the Co-Op’s insolvency would have been apparent.

The Court also explicitly has defined a standard of materiality under the securities \nlaws, see TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), concluding in the proxy-solicitation \ncontext that “[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n738 \nwould consider it important in deciding how to vote.”…We now expressly adopt the TSC Industries \nstandard of materiality for the 5 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. \n \nThe application of this materiality standard to preliminary merger discussions is not self-evident. Where \nthe impact of the corporate development on the target’s fortune is certain and clear, the TSC Industries \nmateriality definition admits straight-forward application. Where, on the other hand, the event is \ncontingent or speculative in nature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the “reasonable investor” would \nhave considered the omitted information significant at the time. Merger negotiations, because of the ever-\npresent possibility that the contemplated transaction will not be effectuated, fall into the latter category. \n \n* * * \n \nEven before this Court’s decision in TSC Industries, the Second Circuit had explained the role of the \nmateriality requirement of Rule 10b-5, with respect to contingent or speculative information or events, in \na manner that gave that term meaning that is independent of the other provisions of the Rule. Under such \ncircumstances, materiality “will depend at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated \nprobability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of \nthe company activity.” SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d, at 849. \n \n* * * \n \nWhether merger discussions in any particular case are material therefore depends on the facts. Generally, \nin order to assess the probability that the event will occur, a factfinder will need to look to indicia of \ninterest in the transactions at the highest corporate levels. Without attempting to catalog all such possible \nfactors, we note by way of example that board resolutions, instructions to investment bankers, and actual \nnegotiations between principals or their intermediaries may serve as indicia of interest. To assess the \nmagnitude of the transaction to the issuer of the securities allegedly manipulated, a factfinder will need to \nconsider such facts as the size of the two corporate entities and of the potential premiums over market \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n739 \nvalue. No particular event or factor short of closing the transaction need to be either necessary or \nsufficient by itself to render merger discussions material. \n \nAs we clarify today, materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the \nwithheld or misrepresented information. The fact-specific inquiry we endorse here is consistent with the \napproach a number of courts have taken in assessing the materiality of merger negotiations. Because the \nstandard of materiality we have adopted differs from that used by both courts below, we remand the case \nfor reconsideration of the question whether a grant of summary judgment is appropriate on this record. \n \nWe turn to the question of reliance and the fraud on-the-market theory. Succinctly put: \n \nThe fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed \nsecurities market, the price of a company’s stock is determined by the available information \nregarding the company and its business.…Misleading statements will therefore defraud \npurchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.…The causal \nconnection between the defendants’ fraud and the plaintiff’s purchase of stock in such a case is no \nless significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. Peil v. Speiser, 806 F.2d \n1154, 1160-1161 (CA3 1986). \n \n* * * \nWe agree that reliance is an element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action. Reliance provides the requisite causal \nconnection between a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s \ninjury. There is, however, more than one way to demonstrate the causal connection. \n \n* * * \n \nPresumptions typically serve to assist courts in managing circumstances in which direct proof, for one \nreason or another, is rendered difficult.

We briefly \nconsider successor liability—whether a successor corporation, such as a corporation that purchases \nall of the assets of another corporation, is liable for debts, lawsuits, and other liabilities of the \npurchased corporation. We then turn to appraisal rights, which are a shareholder’s right to dissent \nfrom a corporate expansion. Next, we look at several aspects, such as jurisdiction and taxation, of \nforeign corporations—corporations that are incorporated in a state that is different from the one in \nwhich they do business. We conclude the chapter with dissolution of the corporation. \n \n18.1 Corporate Expansion \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Understand the four methods of corporate expansion: purchase of assets other than in the regular course \nof business, merger, consolidation, and purchase of stock in another corporation. \n \n \nIn popular usage, “merger” often is used to mean any type of expansion by which one corporation \nacquires part or all of another corporation. But in legal terms, merger is only one of four methods of \nachieving expansion other than by internal growth. \n \nPurchase of Assets \nOne method of corporate expansion is the purchase of assets of another corporation. At the most basic \nlevel, ABC Corporation wishes to expand, and the assets of XYZ Corporation are attractive to ABC. So ABC \npurchases the assets of XYZ, resulting in the expansion of ABC. After the purchase, XYZ may remain in \ncorporate form or may cease to exist, depending on how many of its assets were purchased by ABC. \n \nThere are several advantages to an asset purchase, most notably, that the acquiring corporation can pick \nwhat assets and liabilities (with certain limitations, discussed further on in this section) it wishes to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n747 \nacquire. Furthermore, certain transactions may avoid a shareholder vote. If the selling corporation does \nnot sell substantially all of its assets, then its shareholders may not get a vote to approve the sale. \n \nFor example, after several years of successful merchandising, a corporation formed by Bob, Carol, and Ted \n(BCT Bookstore, Inc.) has opened three branch stores around town and discovered its transportation \ncosts mounting. Inventory arrives in trucks operated by the Flying Truckman Co., Inc. The BCT \ncorporation concludes that the economics of delivery do not warrant purchasing a single truck dedicated \nto hauling books for its four stores alone. Then Bob learns that the owners of Flying Truckman might be \nwilling to part with their company because it has not been earning money lately. If BCT could reorganize \nFlying Truckman’s other routes, it could reduce its own shipping costs while making a profit on other lines \nof business. \n \nUnder the circumstances, the simplest and safest way to acquire Flying Truckman is by purchasing its \nassets. That way BCT would own the trucks and whatever routes it chooses, without taking upon itself the \nstigma of the association. It could drop the name Flying Truckman. \n \nIn most states, the board of directors of both the seller and the buyer must approve a transfer of assets. \nShareholders of the selling corporation must also consent by majority vote, but shareholders of the \nacquiring company need not be consulted, so Ted’s opposition can be effectively mooted; see Figure 18.1 \n\"Purchase of Assets\". (When inventory is sold in bulk, the acquiring company must also comply with the \nlaw governing bulk transfers.) By purchasing the assets—trucks, truck routes, and the trademark Flying \nTruckman (to prevent anyone else from using it)—the acquiring corporation can carry on the functions of \nthe acquired company without carrying on its business as such.

(When inventory is sold in bulk, the acquiring company must also comply with the \nlaw governing bulk transfers.) By purchasing the assets—trucks, truck routes, and the trademark Flying \nTruckman (to prevent anyone else from using it)—the acquiring corporation can carry on the functions of \nthe acquired company without carrying on its business as such. [1] \n \nFigure 18.1 Purchase of Assets \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n748 \n \n \nSuccessor Liability \nOne of the principal advantages of this method of expansion is that the acquiring company generally is not \nliable for the debts and/or lawsuits of the corporation whose assets it purchased, generally known \nas successor liability. Suppose BCT paid Flying Truckman $250,000 for its trucks, routes, and name. \nWith that cash, Flying Truckman paid off several of its creditors. Its shareholders then voted to dissolve \nthe corporation, leaving one creditor unsatisfied. The creditor can no longer sue Flying Truckman since it \ndoes not exist. So he sues BCT. Unless certain circumstances exist, as discussed in Ray v. Alad \nCorporation (see Section 18.4.1 \"Successor Liability\"), BCT is not liable for Flying Truckman’s debts. \n \nSeveral states, although not a majority, have adopted the Ray product-line exception approach to \nsuccessor liability. The general rule is that the purchasing corporation does not take the liabilities of the \nacquired corporation. Several exceptions exist, as described in Ray, the principal exception being the \nproduct-line approach. This minority exception has been further limited in several jurisdictions by \napplying it solely to cases involving products liability. Other jurisdictions also permit a continuity-of-\nenterprise exception, whereby the court examines how closely the acquiring corporation’s business is to \nthe acquired corporation’s business (e.g., see Turner v. Bituminous Casualty Co.).[2] \n \nMerger \nWhen the assets of a company are purchased, the selling company itself may or may not go out of \nexistence. By contrast, in a merger, the acquired company goes out of existence by being absorbed into the \nacquiring company. In the example in Section 18.1.2 \"Merger\", Flying Truck would merge into BCT, \nresulting in Flying Truckman losing its existence. The acquiring company receives all of the acquired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n749 \ncompany’s assets, including physical property and intangible property such as contracts and goodwill. The \nacquiring company also assumes all debts of the acquired company. \n \nA merger begins when two or more corporations negotiate an agreement outlining the specifics of a \nmerger, such as which corporation survives and the identities of management personnel. There are two \nmain types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. In a cash merger, the shareholders of the \ndisappearing corporation surrender their shares for cash. These shareholders retain no interest in the \nsurviving corporation, having been bought out. This is often called a freeze-out merger, since the \nshareholders of the disappearing corporation are frozen out of an interest in the surviving corporation. \n \nIn a noncash merger, the shareholders of the disappearing corporation retain an interest in the surviving \ncorporation. The shareholders of the disappearing corporation trade their shares for shares in the \nsurviving corporation; thus they retain an interest in the surviving corporation when they become \nshareholders of that surviving corporation. \n \nUnless the articles of incorporation state otherwise, majority approval of the merger by both boards of \ndirectors and both sets of shareholders is necessary (see Figure 18.2 \"Merger\"). The shareholder majority \nmust be of the total shares eligible to vote, not merely of the total actually represented at the special \nmeeting called for the purpose of determining whether to merge. \n \nFigure 18.2 Merger \n \n \nConsolidation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n750 \nConsolidation is virtually the same as a merger. The companies merge, but the resulting entity is a new \ncorporation. Returning to our previous example, BCT and Flying Truckman could consolidate and form a \nnew corporation. As with mergers, the boards and shareholders must approve the consolidation by \nmajority votes (see Figure 18.3 \"Consolidation\"). The resulting corporation becomes effective when the \nsecretary of state issues a certificate of merger or incorporation. \n \nFigure 18.3Consolidation \n \n \nFor more information on mergers and consolidation under Delaware law, see Del.

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt. A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target. The purchasers also use other types of debt, such as the issuance of bonds or a loan, \nto implement the LBO. \n \nFor more information about tender offers and mergers, see Unocal v. Mesa [3]and Revlon v. MacAndrews \n& Forbes. [4] The Wall Street Journal provides comprehensive coverage of tender offers, mergers, and \nLBOs, athttp://www.wsj.com. \n \nState versus Federal Regulation of Takeovers \nUnder the federal Williams Act, upon commencement of a tender offer for more than 5 percent of the \ntarget’s stock, the offeror must file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nstating the source of funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent \nof its holdings in the target company. Even when a tender offer has not been made, the Williams Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n752 \nrequires any person who acquires more than 5 percent ownership of a corporation to file a statement with \nthe SEC within ten days. The Williams Act, which made certain amendments to the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934, can be viewed at http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/. The US Constitution is also implicated \nin the regulation of foreign corporations. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect. Many of the laws expressly gave management of the target companies a right to a hearing, which \ncould be dragged out for weeks or months, giving the target time to build up a defense. The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state",

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts.

[2] \n \nTypical Requirements for Foreign Corporations \nCertain preconditions for doing business are common to most states. Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however. The state attorney general has authority to collect \ncivil penalties that vary from state to state. Other sanctions in various states include fines and penalties on \ntaxes owed; fines and imprisonment of corporate agents, directors, and officers; nullification of corporate \ncontracts; and personal liability on contracts by officers and directors. In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court \nupheld the validity of long-arm statutes applied to corporations in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington. [3] But the long-arm statute will only be constitutionally valid where there are minimum \ncontacts—that is, for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, the foreign \ncorporation must have at least “minimum contacts” the state. That jurisdictional test is still applied many \nyears after the International Shoe decision was handed down. [4] Since International Shoe, the \nnationalization of commerce has given way to the internationalization of commerce. This change has \nresulted in difficult jurisdictional questions that involve conflicting policy considerations.

The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state. These transactions must meet the minimum-contacts \nrequirement for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes. A state may tax a foreign corporation as long as it does \nnot burden interstate commerce. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n759 \n \n1.

Rptr. 574 (Cal. 1977) \n \nClaiming damages for injury from a defective ladder, plaintiff asserts strict tort liability against defendant \nAlad Corporation (Alad II) which neither manufactured nor sold the ladder but prior to plaintiff’s injury \nsucceeded to the business of the ladder’s manufacturer, the now dissolved “Alad Corporation” (Alad I), \nthrough a purchase of Alad I’s assets for an adequate cash consideration. Upon acquiring Alad I’s plant, \nequipment, inventory, trade name, and good will, Alad II continued to manufacture the same line of \nladders under the “Alad” name, using the same equipment, designs, and personnel, and soliciting Alad I’s \ncustomers through the same sales representatives with no outward indication of any change in the \nownership of the business. The trial court entered summary judgment for Alad II and plaintiff appeals.… \n \nOur discussion of the law starts with the rule ordinarily applied to the determination of whether a \ncorporation purchasing the principal assets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities. As \ntypically formulated, the rule states that the purchaser does not assume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) \nthere is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n764 \nmerger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) \nthe transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller’s \ndebts. \n \nIf this rule were determinative of Alad II’s liability to plaintiff it would require us to affirm the summary \njudgment. None of the rule’s four stated grounds for imposing liability on the purchasing corporation is \npresent here. There was no express or implied agreement to assume liability for injury from defective \nproducts previously manufactured by Alad I. Nor is there any indication or contention that the transaction \nwas prompted by any fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for Alad I’s debts. \n \nWith respect to the second stated ground for liability, the purchase of Alad I’s assets did not amount to a \nconsolidation or merger. This exception has been invoked where one corporation takes all of another’s \nassets without providing any consideration that could be made available to meet claims of the other’s \ncreditors or where the consideration consists wholly of shares of the purchaser’s stock which are promptly \ndistributed to the seller’s shareholders in conjunction with the seller’s liquidation. In the present case the \nsole consideration given for Alad I’s assets was cash in excess of $ 207,000. Of this amount Alad I was \npaid $ 70,000 when the assets were transferred and at the same time a promissory note was given to Alad \nI for almost $ 114,000. Shortly before the dissolution of Alad I the note was assigned to the Hamblys, Alad \nI’s principal stockholders, and thereafter the note was paid in full. The remainder of the consideration \nwent for closing expenses or was paid to the Hamblys for consulting services and their agreement not to \ncompete. There is no contention that this consideration was inadequate or that the cash and promissory \nnote given to Alad I were not included in the assets available to meet claims of Alad I’s creditors at the \ntime of dissolution. Hence the acquisition of Alad I’s assets was not in the nature of a merger or",

By the beginning of \nthe sixteenth century, the British common-law courts began to hear cases involving bills of exchange, but \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n779 \nit took a half century before the courts became comfortable with them and accepted them as crucial to the \ngrowing economy. \n \nCourts were also hesitant until the end of the seventeenth century about sanctioning a transferor’s \nassignment of a promissory note if it meant that the transferee would have better title than the transferor. \nOne reason for the courts’ reluctance to sanction assignments stemmed from the law that permitted \ndebtors to be jailed, a law that was not repealed until 1870. The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law. All states except New York and North Carolina have adopted \nArticles 3 and 4. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n780 \nThe Future of Commercial Paper: Federal and International Preemption \nState law governing commercial paper is vulnerable to federal preemption. This preemption could take \ntwo major forms. First, the Federal Reserve Board governs the activities of Federal Reserve Banks. As a \nresult, Federal Reserve regulations provide important guidelines for the check collection process. Second, \nArticle 3 of the UCC can be preempted by federal statutes. An important example is the Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act, which became effective in 1988 (discussed in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"). \n \nFederal preemption may also become intertwined with international law. In 1988, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International \nPromissory Notes. Progress on the treaty emanating from the convention has been slow, however: the \nUnited States, Canada, and Russia have approved the convention (in 1989 and 1990) but have not ratified \nthe treaty; Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Liberia, and Mexico are the only countries to have ratified it. \n \nCommercial Paper in Economics and Finance \nEconomics \nTo the economist, one type of commercial paper—the bank check—is the primary component of M1, the \nbasic money supply. It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

In short, it doesn’t matter for checks. \n \nMissing and Ambiguous Terms \nThe rules just stated make up the conditions for negotiability. Dealing with two additional details—\nmissing terms or ambiguous terms—completes the picture. Notwithstanding the presence of readily \navailable form instruments, sometimes people leave words out or draw up confusing documents. \n \nIncompleteness \nAn incomplete instrument—one that is missing an essential element, like the due date or amount—can be \nsigned before being completed if the contents at the time of signing show that the maker or drawer \nintends it to become a negotiable instrument. Unless the date of an instrument is required to determine \nwhen it is payable, an undated instrument can still be negotiable. [3] Otherwise, to be enforceable, the \ninstrument must first be completed—if not by the maker or drawer, then by the holder in accordance with \nwhatever authority he has to do so.

If \nthe instrument contains a “conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or \norder is not negotiable,” its negotiability is destroyed, except for checks, and “an instrument may be a \ncheck even though it is described on its face by another term, such as ‘money order.’” [5] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIf an instrument is not negotiable, it generally will not be acceptable as payment in commercial transactions. \nThe UCC requires that the value of a negotiable instrument be ascertainable on its face, without reference to \nother documents. Thus the negotiable instrument must be in writing, signed by the maker or drawer, an \nunconditional promise or order to pay, for a fixed amount in money, payable on demand or at a definite time, \nand payable to order or bearer, unless it is a check. If the instrument is incomplete or ambiguous, the UCC \nprovides rules to determine what the instrument means. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

But in some cases the transfer of possession is involuntary and in \nsome cases the person transferring possession is not a holder.…[S]ubsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is \npayable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the \nholder of the instrument when possession is obtained. In this case there is an involuntary transfer \nof possession that results in negotiation to Thief or Finder. [1] \n \nIn other words, to qualify as a holder, a person must possess an instrument that runs to her. An \ninstrument “runs” to a person if (1) it has been issued to her or (2) it has been transferred to her by \nnegotiation (negotiation is the “post-issuance event” cited in the comment). Commercially speaking, the \nstatus of the immediate person to whom the instrument was issued (the payee) is not very interesting; the \nthing of interest is whether the instrument is passed on by the payee after possession, through \nnegotiation. Yes, the payee of an instrument is a holder, and can be a holder in due course, but the crux of \nnegotiable instruments involves taking an instrument free of defenses that might be claimed by anybody \nagainst paying on the instrument; the payee would know of defenses, usually, so—as the comment puts \nit—“use of the holder-in-due-course doctrine by the payee of an instrument is not the normal \nsituation.…[r]ather, the holder in due course is an immediate or remote transferee of the payee.” [2] \n \nLiability of Transferors \nWe discuss liability in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". However, a brief introduction to liability will \nhelp in understanding the types of indorsements discussed in this chapter. There are two types of liability \naffecting transferors: contract liability and warranty liability. \n \nContract Liability \nPersons who sign the instrument—that is, makers, acceptors, drawers, indorsers—have signed a contract \nand are subject to contract liabilities. Drafts (checks) and notes are, after all, contracts. Makers and \nacceptors are primary parties and are unconditionally liable to pay the instrument. Drawers and \nindorsers are secondary parties and are conditionally liable. The conditions creating liability—that is, \npresentment, dishonor, and notice—are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n813 \n \nWarranty Liability \nThe transferor’s contract liability is limited. It applies only to those who sign and only if certain additional \nconditions are met and, as will be discussed, can even be disclaimed. Consequently, a holder who has not \nbeen paid often must resort to a suit based on one of five warranties. These warranties are implied by law; \nUCC, Section 3-416, details them: \n \n(A) A person who transfers an instrument for consideration warrants all of the following to the \ntransferee and, if the transfer is by indorsement, to any subsequent transferee: \n(1) The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the instrument. \n(2) All signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized. \n(3) The instrument has not been altered. \n(4) The instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which can be \nasserted against the warrantor. \n(5) The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to \nthe maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer. \n \nBreach of one of these warranties must be proven at trial if there is no general contract liability. \n \nLiability of Transferees \nThe transferee takes by assignment; as an assignee, the new owner of the instrument has only those rights \nheld by the assignor. Claims that could be asserted by third parties against the assignor can be asserted \nagainst the assignee. A negotiable instrument can be transferred in this sense without being negotiated. A \npayee, for example, might fail to meet all the requirements of negotiation; in that event, the instrument \nmight wind up being merely transferred (assigned). When all requirements of negotiability and \nnegotiation have been met, the buyer is a holder and may (if a holder in due course—see Chapter 21 \n\"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\") collect on the instrument without having to prove anything more. \nBut if the instrument was not properly negotiated, the purchaser is at most a transferee and cannot collect \nif defenses are available, even if the paper itself is negotiable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n814 \n \nHow Negotiation Is Accomplished \nNegotiation can occur with either bearer paper or order paper.",

Know the effects of various types of indorsements: no indorsement, partial, blank, special, restrictive, \nconditional, qualified. \n \n \nDefinition and Formal Requirements of Indorsement \nDefinition \nMost commonly, paper is transferred by indorsement. The indorsement is evidence that the indorser \nintended the instrument to move along in the channels of commerce. An indorsement is defined by \nUCC Section 3-204(a) as \n \na signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied \nby other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the instrument, (ii) \nrestricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on the instrument, but \nregardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement \nunless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other \ncircumstances unambiguously indicated that the signature was made for a purpose other than \nindorsement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n817 \n \n \nPlacement of Indorsement \nIndorse (or endorse) literally means “on the back of,” as fish, say, have dorsal fins—fins on their backs. \nUsually indorsements are on the back of the instrument, but an indorsement could be on a piece of paper \naffixed to the instrument. Such an attachment is called an allonge—it comes along with the instrument \n(UCC, Section 3-204(a)). \n \nThere are rules about where indorsements are placed. The Expedited Funds Availability Act was enacted \nin 1987 by Congress to standardize holding periods on deposits made to commercial banks and to regulate \ninstitutions’ use of deposit holds—that is, how soon customers can access the money after they have \ndeposited a check in the bank. The Federal Reserve Board subsequently adopted “Regulation CC, Check \nEndorsement Standards” to improve funds availability and expedite the return of checks. See Figure 20.3 \n\"Indorsement Standard\". \n \nFigure 20.3 Indorsement Standard \n \nFrom UC Irvine Administrative Policies & Procedures, Business and Financial Affairs, Financial \nServices, Sec. 704-13: Check Endorsement Procedures, \nathttp://www.policies.uci.edu/adm/procs/700/704-13.html. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n818 \nAs shown in Figure 20.3 \"Indorsement Standard\", specific implementing guidelines define criteria for the \nplacement, content, and ink color of endorsement areas on the back of checks for the depositary bank \n(bank of first deposit), subsequent indorsers (paying banks), and corporate or payee indorsers. \nIndorsements must be made within 1½ inches of the trailing (left) edge of the back of the check; \nremaining space is for bank indorsements. There is no penalty for violating the standard—it is a guideline. \nThe abbreviation “MICR” stands for magnetic ink character recognition. The “clear band” is a section of \nthe back of the check that is not supposed to be intruded upon with any magnetic (machine-readable) \nprinting that would interfere with machine reading on the front side (the bank routing numbers). \n \nSometimes an indorser adds words intended to strengthen the indorsement; for example, “I hereby assign \nall my right, title, and interest in this note to Carl Carpenter.” Words of assignment such as these and also \nwords of condition, waiver, guaranty, limitation, or disclaimer of liability do not negate the effect of an \nindorsement. \n \nMisspelled or Incorrect Indorsements \nWhen the instrument is made payable to a person under a misspelled name (or in a name other than his \nown), he may indorse in the wrong name or the right one or both. It is safer to sign in both names, and the \npurchaser of the instrument may demand a signature in both names (UCC, Section 3-204(d)). \n \nVarious Indorsements and Their Effects \nA holder can indorse in a variety of ways; indorsements are not identical and have different effects. \n \nNo Indorsement \nIf the instrument requires a signature, transfer without indorsement is an assignment only. Bearer paper \ndoes not require indorsement, so it can be negotiated simply by delivering it to the transferee, who \nbecomes a holder. The transferor has no contract liability on the instrument, however, because he has not \nsigned it. He does remain liable on the warranties, but only to the person who receives the paper, not to \nsubsequent transferees. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n819 \nBecause it is common practice for a depository bank (the bank into which a person makes a deposit) to \nreceive unindorsed checks under so-called lockbox agreements from customers who receive a high volume \nof checks, a customer who is a holder can deposit a check or other instrument for credit to his account \nwithout indorsement. Section 4-205(1) of the UCC provides that a “depositary bank becomes a holder…at",

Section 3-206(a) of the UCC provides that an attempt to limit payment to a particular person or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n821 \nprohibit further transfer “is not effective.” Nor is “[a]n indorsement stating a condition to the right of the \nindorsee to receive payment”; the restriction may be disregarded. However, two legitimate restrictive \nindorsements are valid: collection indorsements and trust indorsements. Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. \nv. Richland State Bank (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with conditional and restrictive indorsements. \n \nCollection Indorsement \nIt is very common for people and businesses to mail checks to their bank for deposit to their accounts. \nSometimes mail goes astray or gets stolen. Surely it must be permissible for the customer to safeguard the \ncheck by restricting its use to depositing it in her account. A collection indorsement, such as “For \ndeposit” or “For collection,” is effective. Section 3-206(c) of the UCC provides that anybody other than a \nbank who purchases the instrument with such an indorsement converts the instrument—effectively steals \nit. A depositary bank that takes it must deposit it as directed, or the bank has converted it. A payor bank \nthat is also the depositary bank that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter \nconverts it: the check cannot be cashed; it must be deposited (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\"). \n \nTo illustrate, suppose that Kate Jones indorses her paycheck “For deposit only, Kate Jones,” which is by \nfar the most common type of restrictive indorsement (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", right). A \nthief steals the check, indorses his name below the restrictive indorsement, and deposits the check in Last \nBank, where he has an account, or cashes it. The check moves through the collection process to Second \nBank and then to First Bank, which pays the check. Kate has the right to recover only from Last Bank, \nwhich did not properly honor the indorsement by depositing the payment in her account. \n \nTrust Indorsement \nA second legitimate restrictive indorsement is indorsement in trust, called a \ntrust indorsement (sometimes agency indorsement). Suppose Paul Payee owes Carlene Creditor a \ndebt. Payee indorses a check drawn to him by a third party, “Pay to Tina Attorney in trust for Carlene \nCreditor.” Attorney indorses in blank and delivers it to (a) a holder for value, (b) a depository bank for \ncollection, or (c) a payor bank for payment. In each case, these takers can safely pay Attorney so long as \nthey have no notice under Section 3-307 of the UCC of any breach of fiduciary duty that Attorney may be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n822 \ncommitting. For example, under Section 3-307(b), these takers have notice of a breach of trust if the check \nwas taken in any transaction known by the taker to be for Attorney’s personal benefit. Subsequent \ntransferees of the check from the holder or depositary bank are not affected by the restriction unless they \nhave knowledge that Attorney dealt with the check in breach of trust (adapted from UCC, Section 3-206, \nOfficial Comment 4). (Of course Attorney should not indorse in blank; she should indorse “Tina Attorney, \nin trust for Carlene Creditor” and deposit the check in her trust account.) \n \nThe dichotomy here between restrictive and unrestrictive indorsements is the indorser’s way of showing \nto what use the instrument may be put. \n \nConditional Indorsement \nAn indorser might want to condition the negotiation of an instrument upon some event, such as “Pay \nCarla Green if she finishes painting my house by July 15.” Such a conditional indorsement is generally \nineffective: the UCC, Section 3-206(b), says a person paying for value can disregard the condition without \nliability. \n \nQualified Indorsement \nAn indorser can limit his liability by making a qualified indorsement. The usual qualified indorsement \nconsists of the words “without recourse,” which mean that the indorser has no contract liability to \nsubsequent holders if a maker or drawee defaults. A qualified indorsement does not impair negotiability. \nThe qualification must be in writing by signature on the instrument itself. By disclaiming contract \nliability, the qualified indorser also limits his warranty liabilities, though he does not eliminate them. \nSection 3-415(a) of the UCC narrows the indorser’s warranty that no defense of any party is good against \nthe indorser. In its place, the qualified indorser warrants merely that he has no knowledge of any defense. \n \n“Without recourse” indorsements can have a practical impact on the balance sheet. A company holding a \npromissory note can obtain cash by discounting it—indorsing it over to a bank for maturity value less the \nbank’s discount. As an indorser, however, the company remains liable to pay the amount to subsequent \nholders should the maker default at maturity. The balance sheet must reflect this possibility as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n823",

The Federal Reserve \nBoard has recommendations for how instruments should be indorsed to speed machine reading of them. \nIndorsements are either blank or special; they are either restrictive or nonrestrictive; and they are either \nqualified or unqualified. These pairings show the indorser’s intention as to how further negotiation may be \naccomplished, to what uses the instrument may be put, and what liability the indorser is willing to assume. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. If an instrument is not indorsed according to Federal Reserve Board standards, is it still valid? \n2. Suppose that Indorsee signs an instrument in blank and drops it. Suppose that the instrument is found by \nFinder and that Finder delivers it to Third Person with the intention to sell it. Is this successful negotiation? \n3. Why would a person make a restrictive indorsement? A qualified indorsement? \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n824 \n20.3 Problems and Issues in Negotiation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Recognize under what circumstances a negotiation is subject to rescission. \n2. Know the effect of reacquisition of an instrument. \n3. Understand how instruments made payable to two or more persons are negotiated. \n4. Understand how the UCC treats forged indorsements, imposters, and other signatures in the name of the \npayee. \n \n \nCommon Issues Arising in Negotiation of Commercial Paper \nA number of problems commonly arise that affect the negotiation of commercial paper. Here we take up \nthree. \n \nNegotiation Subject to Rescission \nA negotiation—again, transfer of possession to a person who becomes a holder—can be effective even \nwhen it is made by a person without the capacity to sign. Section 3-202(a) of the UCC declares that \nnegotiation is effective even when the indorsement is made by an infant or by a corporation exceeding its \npowers; is obtained by fraud, duress, or mistake; is part of an illegal transaction; or is made in breach of a \nduty. \n \nHowever, unless the instrument was negotiated to a holder in due course, the indorsement can be \nrescinded or subjected to another appropriate legal remedy. The Official Comment to this UCC section is \nhelpful: \n \nSubsection (a) applies even though the lack of capacity or the illegality is of a character which \ngoes to the essence of the transaction and makes it entirely void. It is inherent in the character of \nnegotiable instruments that any person in possession of an instrument which by its terms is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n825 \npayable to that person or to bearer is a holder and may be dealt with by anyone as a holder. The \nprinciple finds its most extreme application in the well-settled rule that a holder in due course \nmay take the instrument even from a thief and be protected against the claim of the rightful \nowner. The policy of subsection (a) is that any person to whom an instrument is negotiated is a \nholder until the instrument has been recovered from that person’s possession. [1] \n \nSo suppose a mentally incapacitated person under a guardianship evades her guardian, goes to town, and \nwrites a check for a new car. Normally, contracts made by such persons are void. But the check is \nnegotiable here. If the guardian finds out about the escapade before the check leaves the dealer’s hands, \nthe deal could be rescinded: the check could be retrieved and the car returned. \n \nEffect of Reacquisition \nA prior party who reacquires an instrument may reissue it or negotiate it further. But doing so discharges \nintervening parties as to the reacquirer and to later purchasers who are not holders in due course. Section \n3-207 of the UCC permits the reacquirer to cancel indorsements unnecessary to his title or ownership; in \nso doing, he eliminates the liability of such indorsers even as to holders in due course.",

In form, the payees can be listed in the alternative \nor jointly. When a commercial paper says “Pay to the order of Lorna Love or Rackets, Inc.,” it is stated in \nthe alternative. Either person may negotiate (or discharge or enforce) the paper without the consent of the \nother. On the other hand, if the paper says “Pay to the order of Lorna Love and Rackets, Inc.” or does not \nclearly state that the payees are to be paid in the alternative, then the instrument is payable to both of \nthem and may be negotiated (or discharged or enforced) only by both of them acting together. The case \npresented in Section 20.4 \"Cases\", Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. v. Richland State Bank, deals, \nindirectly, with instruments payable to two or more persons. \n \nForged Indorsements, Imposters, and Fictitious Payees \nThe General Rule on Forged Indorsements \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n826 \nWhen a check already made out to a payee is stolen, an unscrupulous person may attempt to negotiate it \nby forging the payee’s name as the indorser. Under UCC Section 1-201(43), a forgery is an “unauthorized \nsignature.” Section 3-403(a) provides that any unauthorized signature on an instrument is “ineffective \nexcept as the signature of the unauthorized signer.” The consequence is that, generally, the loss falls on \nthe first party to take the instrument with a forged or unauthorized signature because that person is in the \nbest position to prevent the loss. \n \nLorna Love writes a check to Steve Supplier on her account at First State Bank, but the check goes astray \nand is found by Carl Crooks. Crooks indorses the check “Steve Supplier” and presents it for cash to a busy \nteller who fails to request identification. Two days later, Steve Supplier inquires about his check. Love \ncalls First State Bank to stop payment. Too late—the check has been cashed. Who bears the loss—Love, \nSupplier, or the bank? The bank does, and it must recredit Love’s account. The forged indorsement on the \ncheck was ineffective; the bank was not a holder, and the check should not have been allowed into the \nchannels of commerce. This is why banks may retain checks for a while before allowing access to the \nmoney. It is, in part, what the Expedited Funds Availability Act (mentioned in Section 20.2 \n\"Indorsements\", “Indorsements”) addresses—giving banks time to assess the validity of checks. \n \nExceptions: Imposter, Fictitious Payee, and Dishonest Employee Rules \nThe loss for a forged indorsement usually falls on the first party to take the instrument with a forged \nsignature. However, there are three important exceptions to this general rule: the imposter rule, the \nfictitious payee rule, and the dishonest employee rule. \n \nThe Imposter Rule \nIf one person poses as the named payee or as an agent of the named payee, inducing the maker or drawer \nto issue an instrument in the name of the payee to the imposter (or his confederate), the imposter’s \nindorsement of the payee’s name is effective. The paper can be negotiated according to the \nimposter rule. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n827 \nIf the named payee is a real person or firm, the negotiation of the instrument by the imposter is good and \nhas no effect on whatever obligation the drawer or maker has to the named payee. Lorna Love owes Steve \nSupplier $2,000. Knowing of the debt, Richard Wright writes to Love, pretending to be Steve Supplier, \nrequesting her to send a check to Wright’s address in Supplier’s name. When the check arrives, Wright \nindorses it by signing “Pay to the order of Richard Wright, (signed) Steve Supplier,” and then indorses it \nin his own name and cashes it. Love remains liable to Steve Supplier for the money that she owes him, and \nLove is out the $2,000 unless she can find Wright. \n \nThe difference between this case and the one involving the forger Carl Crooks is that in the second case \nthe imposter (Wright) “induced the maker or drawer [Lorna Love] to issue the instrument…by \nimpersonating the payee of the instrument [Steve Supplier]” (UCC, Section 3-404(a)), whereas in the first \ncase the thief did not induce Love to issue the check to him—he simply found it.

The defendant’s \npersonnel thereafter quickly confirmed the plaintiff as the original purchaser of the lost voucher. The \ndefendant placed a computerized “stop” on the voucher. However, whoever had happened upon the \nvoucher in the SAMS machine and taken it had acted even more quickly: the voucher had been brought to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n832 \na nearby track window and “cashed out” within a minute or so of the plaintiff having mistakenly left it in \nthe SAMS machine. \n \nThe plaintiff now sues the defendant, contending that the defendant should be liable for having failed to \n“provide any minimal protection to its customers” in checking the identity and ownership of vouchers \nprior to permitting their “cash out.” The defendant, in response, contends that the voucher consists of \n“bearer paper,” negotiable by anyone having possession, and that it is under no obligation to purchasers \nof vouchers to provide any such identity or ownership checks. \n \nAs opposed to instruments such as ordinary checks, which are typically made payable to the order of a \nspecific person and are therefore known as “order paper,” bearer paper is payable to the “bearer,” i.e., \nwhoever walks in carrying (or “bearing”) the instrument. Pursuant to [New York’s UCC] “[a]n instrument \nis payable to bearer when by its terms it is payable to…(c) ‘cash’ or the order of ‘cash’, or any other \nindication which does not purport to designate a specific payee.” \n \nEach New York Racing Association voucher is labeled “Cash Voucher.” Each voucher contains the legend \n“Bet Against the Value or Exchange for Cash.” Each voucher is also encoded with certain computer \nsymbols which are readable by SAMS machines. The vouchers do by their terms constitute “bearer paper.” \n \nThere is no doubt that under the [1990 Revision] Model Uniform Commercial Code the defendant would \nbe a “holder in due course” of the voucher, deemed to have taken it free from all defenses that could be \nraised by the plaintiff. As observed in 2 White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code pp. 225–226, 152–\n153 (4th ed.1995): \n \nConsider theft of bearer instruments…[T]he thief can make his or her transferee a holder simply \nby transfer to one who gives value in good faith. If the thief’s transferee cashes the check and so \ngives value in good faith and without notice of any defense, that transferee will be a holder in due \ncourse under 3-302, free of all claims to the instrument on the part…of any person and free of all \npersonal defenses of any prior party. Therefore, the holder in due course will not be liable in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n833 \nconversion to the true owner.…Of course, the owner of the check will have a good cause of action \nagainst the thief, but no other cause of action.… \n \nIf an instrument is payable to bearer…the possessor of the instrument will be a holder and, if he \nmeets the other tests, a holder in due course. This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York.

[2] In 1990, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Law Institute \napproved a revised Article 3. This revised Article 3 has never been enacted in New York. Comment 1 to § \n3-201 of the [1990] Uniform Commercial Code, commenting on the difference between it and its \npredecessor (which is still in effect in New York), states: \n \nA person can become holder of an instrument…as the result of an event that occurs after issuance. \n“Negotiation” is the term used in Article 3 to describe this post-issuance event.…In defining \n“negotiation” former Section 3-202(1) used the word “transfer,” an undefined term, and \n“delivery,” defined in Section 1-201(14) to mean voluntary change of possession. Instead, \nsubsections (a) and (b) [now] use the term “transfer of possession,” and subsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is \npayable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the \nholder of the instrument when possession is obtained. In this case there is an involuntary transfer \nof possession that results in negotiation to Thief or Finder. \n \nThus, it would initially appear that under the prior Model Uniform Commercial Code, still in effect in New \nYork, a thief or finder of bearer paper, as the recipient of an involuntary transfer, could not become a \n“holder,” and thus could not pass holder-in-due-course status, or good title, to someone in the position of \nthe defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n834 \nThis conclusion, however, is not without doubt. For instance, in 2 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code § \n3-202:35 (2nd ed.1971), it was observed that: \n \nThe Code states that bearer paper is negotiated by “delivery.” This is likely to mislead for one is \nnot inclined to think of the acquisition of paper by a finder or a thief as a “voluntary transfer of \npossession.” \nBy stating that the Code’s terminology was “misleading,” the treatise appears to imply that despite the \nliteral import of the words, the contrary was true—negotiation could be accomplished by involuntary \ntransfer, i.e., loss or theft. \n \nIn [Citation], the Appellate Division determined that the Tropicana Casino in New Jersey became a holder \nin due course of signed cashier’s checks with blank payee designations which a thief had stolen from the \ndefendant and negotiated to the casino for value after filling in the payee designation with his brother-in-\nlaw’s name. The Appellate Division, assuming without discussion that the thief was a “holder” of the \nstolen instruments and therefore able to transfer good title, held the defendant obligated to make \npayment on the stolen checks. Accord [Citation] (check cashing service which unknowingly took for value \nfrom an intervening thief the plaintiff’s check, which the plaintiff had endorsed in blank and thus \nconverted to a bearer instrument, was a holder in due course of the check, having received good title from \nthe thief). \n \nPresumably, these results have occurred because the courts in New York have implicitly interpreted the \nundefined term “transfer” as utilized in [the pre-1990] U.C.C. § 3-202(1) as including the involuntary \ntransfer of possession, so that as a practical matter the old Code (as still in effect in New York) has the \nsame meaning as the new Model Uniform Commercial Code, which represents a clarification rather than a \nchange in the law. \n \nThis result makes sense. A contrary result would require extensive verification procedures to be \nundertaken by all transferees of bearer paper. The problem with imposing an identity or ownership check \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n835 \nrequirement on the negotiation of bearer paper is that such a requirement would impede the free \nnegotiability which is the essence of bearer paper. As held in [Citation (1970)], \n \n[Where] the instrument entrusted to a dishonest messenger or agent was freely negotiable bearer \npaper…the drawee bank [cannot] be held liable for making payment to one presenting a \nnegotiable instrument in bearer form who may properly be presumed to be a holder [citations \nomitted]. \n…Moreover, the plaintiff in the instant case knew that the voucher could be “Exchange[d] for cash.” The \nplaintiff conceded at trial that (1) when he himself utilized the voucher prior to its loss, no identity or",

It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the \ncheck jointly to Gill and Wisner as co-payees. Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that \nalone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating \nthe instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on \nthe instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying \nwords is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n846 \nsignature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a \npurpose other than indorsement. \n \nThis paragraph was placed on the back of the check by the government as the maker or drawer of the \ncheck. Consequently, the bank argues that Gill as sole payee could waive, ignore or strike out the \nlanguage. \n \nAlthough the Louisiana jurisprudence contains no similar case dealing with the Uniform Commercial \nCode, we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance…In [Citation, a New Jersey case] (1975), the drawer \nof a check placed instructions on the backs of several checks…that the instruments not be deposited until \na specific future date. However, the payee presented some of the checks prior to the date specified on the \nback. The court found that the drawer did not have the capacity to indorse the instruments; as a result the \ntyped instructions on the backs of the checks could not be indorsements. Instead, they were “merely \nrequests to plaintiff who may or may not comply at its own pleasure. The instructions are neither binding \non plaintiff nor the subsequent holders.” In other words, the payee could ignore the instructions. \n \nIn the instant case, the payee did precisely that. Gill ignored the writing on the back of the check and \ninstructed the teller at the defendant bank to do the same through verbal and written instructions. \n \nWisner argues that by affixing his signature under the writing on the back of the check, Gill made it his \nown indorsement. Furthermore, it asserts that it was a restrictive indorsement, not a conditional one \nwhich could be disregarded pursuant to 3-206. Wisner relies upon the provisions of 3-206 for the \nproposition that the check had a restrictive indorsement and that the bank converted the check because it \nfailed to apply the amount it paid consistently with the indorsement. However, Comment 3 to 3-206 \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \nThis Article does not displace the law of waiver as it may apply to restrictive indorsements. The \ncircumstances under which a restrictive indorsement may be waived by the person who made it \nis not determined by this Article. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n847 \n \nNot all jurisdictions recognize a doctrine of waiver of restrictive indorsements. [Citing cases from various \njurisdictions in which a bank customer effectively requested the bank to disregard a restrictive \nindorsement; some cases affirmed the concept that the restriction could be waived (disregarded), others \ndid not.] \n \n… \n \nIn two cases arising under pre-UCC law, Louisiana recognized that indorsements could be ignored or \nstruck out. In [Citation] (1925), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that the holder of a check could erase \nor strike out a restrictive indorsement on a check that was not necessary to the holder’s title. In [Citation] \n(1967), the court stated that an erroneous indorsement could be ignored and even struck out as \nunnecessary to the plaintiff’s title. \n \nLike the trial court, we find that when Gill affixed his signature under the writing on the back of the check, \nhe made it his own indorsement. We further find that the indorsement was restrictive, not conditional.

Suppose Lorna Love had given Rackets, Inc., a promissory note for \nthe tennis rackets. Knowing that it intended to deliver defective tennis rackets and that Love is likely to \nprotest as soon as the shipment arrives, Rackets offers a deep discount on the note to its fleet mechanic: \ninstead of the $1,000 face value of the note, Rackets will give it to him in payment of an outstanding bill of \n$400. The mechanic, being naive in commercial dealings, has no suspicion from the large discount that \nRackets might be committing fraud. He has acted in good faith under the UCC test. That is not to say that \nno set of circumstances will ever exist to warrant a finding that there was a lack of good faith. \n \n \n \nObservance of Reasonable Commercial Standards of Fair Dealing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n858 \nWhether reasonable commercial standards were observed in the dealings is objectively tested, but buying \nan instrument at a discount—as was done in the tennis rackets example—is not commercially \nunreasonable, necessarily. \n \nWithout Notice \nIt obviously would be unjust to permit a holder to enforce an instrument that he knew—when he acquired \nit—was defective, was subject to claims or defenses, or had been dishonored. A purchaser with knowledge \ncannot become an HDC. But proving knowledge is difficult, so the UCC at Section 3-302(2) lists several \ntypes of notice that presumptively defeat any entitlement to status as HDC. Notice is not limited to receipt \nof an explicit statement; it includes an inference that a person should have made from the circumstances. \nThe explicit things that give a person notice include those that follow. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Is Overdue \nThe UCC provides generally that a person who has notice that an instrument is overdue cannot be an \nHDC. What constitutes notice? When an inspection of the instrument itself would show that it was due \nbefore the purchaser acquired it, notice is presumed. A transferee to whom a promissory note due April \n23 is negotiated on April 24 has notice that it was overdue and consequently is not an HDC. Not all paper \ncontains a due date for the entire amount, and demand paper has no due date at all. In Sections 3-\n302(a)(2) and 3-304, the UCC sets out specific rules dictating what is overdue paper. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Has Been Dishonored \nDishonor means that instrument is not paid when it is presented to the party who should pay it. \n \nWithout Notice of a Defense or Claim \nA purchaser of an instrument cannot be an HDC if he has notice that there are any defenses or claims \nagainst it. A defense is a reason why the would-be obligor will not pay; a claim is an assertion of \nownership in the instrument. If a person is fraudulently induced to issue or make an instrument, he has a \nclaim to its ownership and a defense against paying. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n859 \nWithout Notice of Unauthorized Signature or Alteration \nThis is pretty clear: a person will fail to achieve the HDC status if he has notice of alteration or an \nunauthorized signature. \n \nWithout Reason to Question the Instrument’s Authenticity Because of Apparent Forgery, \nAlteration, or Other Irregularity or Incompleteness as to Call into Question Its Authenticity \nThis also is pretty straightforward, though it is worth observing that a holder will flunk the HDC test if she \nhas notice of unauthorized signature or alteration, or if she should have notice on account of apparent \nirregularity. So a clever forgery would not by itself defeat the HDC status, unless the holder had notice of \nit. \n \nPayee as Holder in Due Course \nThe payee can be an HDC, but in the usual circumstances, a payee would have knowledge of claims or \ndefenses because the payee would be one of the original parties to the instrument. Nevertheless, a payee \nmay be an HDC if all the prerequisites are met. For instance, Blackstone fraudulently convinces \nWhitestone into signing a note as a comaker, with Greenstone as the payee. Without authority, Blackstone \nthen delivers the note for value to Greenstone. Having taken the note in good faith, for value, without \nnotice of any problems, and without cause to question its validity because of apparent irregularities, \nGreenstone is an HDC. In any event, typically the HDC is not the payee of the instrument, but rather, is an \nimmediate or remote transferee of the payee. \n \nThe Shelter Rule \nThere is one last point to mention before we get to the real nub of the holder-in-due-course concept (that \nthe sins of her predecessors are washed away for an HDC). The shelter rule provides that the transferee \nof an instrument acquires the same rights that the transferor had. Thus a person who does not himself \nqualify as an HDC can still acquire that status if some previous holder (someone “upstream”) was an \nHDC. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n860",

Understand how the holder-in-due-course doctrine has been modified for consumer transactions and why. \n \n \nDefenses \nWe mentioned in Section 21.1 \"Holder in Due Course\" that the importance of the holder-in-due-course \nstatus is that it promotes ready transferability of commercial paper by giving transferees confidence that \nthey can buy and in turn sell negotiable instruments without concern that somebody upstream—previous \nholders in the chain of distribution—will have some reason not to pay. The holder-in-due-course doctrine \nmakes the paper almost as readily transferable as cash. Almost, but not quite. We examine first the \ndefenses to which the holder in due course (HDC) is not subject and then—the “almost” part—the \ndefenses to which even HDCs are subject. \n \nHolder in Due Course Is Not Subject to Personal Defenses \nAn HDC is not subject to the obligor’s personal defenses. But a holder who is not an HDC is subject to \nthem: he takes a negotiable instrument subject to the possible personal claims and defenses of numerous \npeople. \nIn general, the personal defenses—to which the HDC is not subject—are similar to the whole range of \ndefenses for breach of simple contract: lack of consideration; failure of consideration; duress, undue \ninfluence, and misrepresentation that does not render the transaction void; breach of warranty; \nunauthorized completion of an incomplete instrument; prior payment. Incapacity that does not render the \ntransaction void (except infancy) is also a personal defense. As the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) puts \nit, this includes “mental incompetence, guardianship, ultra vires acts or lack of corporate capacity to do \nbusiness, or any other incapacity apart from infancy.

[2] But again, the HDC takes free only \nfrom personal defenses of parties with whom she has not dealt. So while the payee of a note can be an \nHDC, if he dealt with the maker, he is subject to the maker’s defenses. \n \nHolder in Due Course Is Subject to Real Defenses \nAn HDC in a nonconsumer transaction is not subject to personal defenses, but he is subject to the so-\ncalled real defenses (or “universal defenses”)—they are good against an HDC. \nThe real defenses good against any holder, including HDCs, are as follows (see Figure 21.2 \"Real \nDefenses\"): \n \n1. Unauthorized signature (forgery) (UCC, Section 3-401(a)) \n2. Bankruptcy (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n3. Infancy (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n4. Fraudulent alteration (UCC, Section 3-407(b) and (c)) \n5. Duress, mental incapacity, or illegality that renders the obligation void (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n6. Fraud in the execution (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n7. Discharge of which the holder has notice when he takes the instrument (UCC, Section 3-601) \nFigure 21.2 Real Defenses \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n864 \nAnalysis of the Real Defenses \nThough most of these concepts are pretty clear, a few comments by way of analysis are appropriate. \n \nForgery \nForgery is a real defense to an action by an HDC. As we have noted, though, negligence in the making or \nhandling of a negotiable instrument may cut off this defense against an HDC—as, for example, when a \ndrawer who uses a rubber signature stamp carelessly leaves it unattended. And notice, too, that Section 3-\n308 of the UCC provides that signatures are presumed valid unless their validity is specifically denied, at \nwhich time the burden shifts to the person claiming validity. These issues are discussed in Triffin v. \nSomerset Valley Bank, in Section 21.3 \"Cases\" of this chapter. \n \nBankruptcy \nDrawers, makers, and subsequent indorsers are not liable to an HDC if they have been discharged in \nbankruptcy. If they were, bankruptcy would not serve much purpose. \n \n \n \nInfancy \nWhether an infant’s signature on a negotiable instrument is a valid defense depends on the law of the \nstate. In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a",

So while the payee of a note can be an HDC, if he dealt with the maker, he is subject to the maker's defenses."

App. 1999) \n \nLytton, J. \n \nFacts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n869 \nOmni purchased some grain from Country Grain, and on February 2, 1996, it issued two checks, totaling \n$75,000, to Country Grain. Country Grain, in turn, endorsed the checks over to Carter as a retainer for \nfuture legal services. Carter deposited the checks on February 5; Country Grain failed the next day. On \nFebruary 8, Carter was notified that Omni had stopped payment on the checks. Carter subsequently filed \na complaint against Omni…alleging that it was entitled to the proceeds of the checks, plus pre-judgment \ninterest, as a holder in due course.…[Carter moved for summary judgment; the motion was denied.] \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nCarter argues that its motion for summary judgment should have been granted because, as a holder in due \ncourse, it has the right to recover on the checks from the drawer, Omni. \n \nThe Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) defines a holder in due course as: \n“the holder of an instrument if: \n \n(1) the instrument when issued does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is \nnot otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity, and (2) the \nholder took the instrument (i) for value,… \n \nSection 3-303(a) of the UCC also states that: \n \n(a) “An instrument is issued or transferred for value if: (1) the instrument is issued or transferred \nfor a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed * * *.” \n(emphasis added) \n \nCarter contends that in Illinois a contract for future legal services should be treated differently than other \nexecutory contracts. It contends that when the attorney-client relationship is created by payment of a fee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n870 \nor retainer, the contract is no longer executory. Thus, Carter would achieve holder in due course status. \nWe are not persuaded. \n \nA retainer is the act of a client employing an attorney; it also denotes the fee paid by the client when he \nretains the attorney to act for him. [Citation] We have found no Illinois cases construing section 3-303(a) \nas it relates to a promise to perform future legal services under a retainer. The general rule, however, is \nthat “an executory promise is not value.” [Citation] “[T]he promise does not rise to the level of ‘value’ in \nthe commercial paper market until it is actually performed.” [Citation] \n \nThe UCC comment to section 303 gives the following example: \n \n“Case # 2. X issues a check to Y in consideration of Y’s promise to perform services in the future. Although \nthe executory promise is consideration for issuance of the check it is value only to the extent the promise \nis performed. \n \nWe have found no exceptions to these principles for retainers. Indeed, courts in other jurisdictions \ninterpreting similar language under section 3-303 have held that attorneys may be holders in due course \nonly to the extent that they have actually performed legal services prior to acquiring a negotiable \ninstrument. See [Citations: Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts]. We agree. \n \nThis retainer was a contract for future legal services. Under section 3-303(a)(1), it was a “promise of \nperformance,” not yet performed. Thus, no value was received, and Carter is not a holder in due course. \n \nFurthermore, in this case, no evidence was presented in the trial court that Carter performed any legal \nservices for Country Grain prior to receiving the checks. Without an evidentiary basis for finding that \nCarter received the checks for services performed, the trial court correctly found that Carter failed to \nprove that it was a holder in due course. [Citations] \n \nConclusion \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n871 \nBecause we have decided that Carter did not take the checks for value under section 3-303(a) of the UCC, \nwe need not address its other arguments. \n \nThe judgment of the circuit court of Peoria County is affirmed. \n \nHoldridge, J., dissenting. \nI respectfully dissent. In a contractual relationship between attorney and client, the payment of a fee or \nretainer creates the relationship, and once that relationship is created the contract is no longer executory. \n[Citation] Carter’s agreement to enter into an attorney-client relationship with Country Grain was the \nvalue exchanged for the checks endorsed over to the firm. Thus, the general rule cited by the majority that \n“an executory promise is not value” does not apply to the case at bar. On that basis I would hold that the \ntrial court erred in determining that Carter was not entitled to the check proceeds and I therefore dissent. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

(ADP) to provide payroll services and a \nfacsimile signature was utilized on all Hauser Co. payroll checks. \n \nMr. Hauser executed affidavits of stolen and forged checks at the Bank, stopping payment on the checks at \nissue. Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn. All eighteen checks bore a red and green facsimile drawer’s signature stamp in the name of \nAlfred M. Hauser. All eighteen checks were marked by the Bank as “stolen check” and stamped with the \nwarning, “do not present again.”… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n878 \n \nPlaintiff then filed this action against the Bank, Hauser Co.,…Plaintiff contended that Hauser Co. was \nnegligent in failing to safeguard both its payroll checks and its authorized drawer’s facsimile stamp, and \nwas liable for payment of the checks. \n \nThe trial court granted plaintiff’s summary judgment motion, concluding that no genuine issue of fact \nexisted as to the authenticity of the eighteen checks at issue. Judge Hoens concluded that because the \ncheck cashing companies took the checks in good faith, plaintiff was a holder in due course as assignee. \nJudge Hoens also found that because the checks appeared to be genuine, Hauser Co. was required, but \nhad failed, to show that plaintiff’s assignor had any notice that the checks were not validly drawn.… \n \nHauser Co. argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because the court failed to properly \naddress Hauser Co.’s defense that the checks at issue were invalid negotiable instruments and therefore \nerred in finding plaintiff was a holder in due course. \n \nAs a threshold matter, it is evident that the eighteen checks meet the definition of a negotiable instrument \n[UCC 3-104]. Each check is payable to a bearer for a fixed amount, on demand, and does not state any \nother undertaking by the person promising payment, aside from the payment of money. In addition, each \ncheck appears to have been signed by Mr. Hauser, through the use of a facsimile stamp, permitted by the \nUCC to take the place of a manual signature. [Section 3-401(b) of the UCC] provides that a “signature may \nbe made manually or by means of a device or machine…with present intention to authenticate a writing.” \nIt is uncontroverted by Hauser Co. that the facsimile signature stamp on the checks is identical to Hauser \nCo.’s authorized stamp. \n \nHauser Co., however, contends that the checks are not negotiable instruments because Mr. Hauser did not \nsign the checks, did not authorize their signing, and its payroll service, ADP, did not produce the checks. \nLack of authorization, however, is a separate issue from whether the checks are negotiable instruments. \nConsequently, given that the checks are negotiable instruments, the next issue is whether the checks are \nunenforceable by a holder in due course, because the signature on the checks was forged or unauthorized. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n879 \n \n[Sections 3-203 and 3-302 of the UCC] discuss the rights of a holder in due course and the rights of a \ntransferee of a holder in due course. Section 3-302 establishes that a person is a holder in due course if: \n \n(1) the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence \nof forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its \nauthenticity; and \n(2) the holder took the instrument for value, in good faith, without notice that the instrument is \noverdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of \nanother instrument issued as part of the same series, without notice that the instrument contains \nan unauthorized signature or has been altered, without notice of any claim to the instrument \ndescribed in 3-306, and without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment \ndescribed in subsection a. of 3-305. \n \n \n \nSection 3-203 deals with transfer of instruments and provides: \n \na.

In support of his summary judgment motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit from each \ncompany; each company swore that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any \nclaims or defenses by any party, without knowledge that any of the signatures on the checks were \nunauthorized or fraudulent, and with the expectation that the checks would be paid upon their \npresentment to the bank upon which the checks were drawn. Hauser Co. does not dispute any of the facts \nsworn to by the check cashing companies. \n \nThe checks were then transferred to plaintiff in accordance with section 3-303, vesting plaintiff with \nholder in due course status. Each company swore that it assigned the checks to plaintiff in exchange for \nconsideration received from plaintiff. Plaintiff thus acquired the check cashing companies’ holder in due \ncourse status when the checks were assigned to plaintiff. Moreover, pursuant to section 3-403(a)’s \nrequirement that the transfer must have been made for the purpose of giving the transferee the right to \nenforce the instrument, the assignment agreements expressly provided plaintiff with that right, stating \nthat “all payments [assignor] may receive from any of the referenced Debtors…shall be the exclusive \nproperty of [assignee].” Again, Hauser Co. does not dispute any facts relating to the assignment of the \nchecks to plaintiff. \n \nHauser Co. contends, instead, that the checks are per se invalid because they were fraudulent and \nunauthorized. Presumably, this argument is predicated on section 3-302. This section states a person is \nnot a holder in due course if the instrument bears “apparent evidence of forgery or alteration” or is \notherwise “so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.” \n \nIn order to preclude liability from a holder in due course under section 3-302, it must be apparent on the \nface of the instrument that it is fraudulent. The trial court specifically found that Hauser Co. had provided \nno such evidence, stating that Hauser Co. had failed to show that there was anything about the \nappearance of the checks to place the check cashing company on notice that any check was not valid. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n881 \nSpecifically, with respect to Hauser Co.’s facsimile signature on the checks, the court stated that the \nsignature was identical to Hauser Co.’s authorized facsimile signature. Moreover, each of the check \ncashing companies certified that they had no knowledge that the signatures on the checks were fraudulent \nor that there were any claims or defenses to enforcement of the checks. Hence, the trial court’s conclusion \nthat there was no apparent evidence of invalidity was not an abuse of discretion and was based on a \nreasonable reading of the record. \n \nTo be sure, section 3-308(a) does shift the burden of establishing the validity of the signature to the \nplaintiff, but only if the defendant specifically denies the signature’s validity in the pleadings. The section \nstates: \n \nIn an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each \nsignature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity \nof a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person \nclaiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action \nis to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time \nof trial of the issue of validity of the signature.",

As a result, this third party is entitled to collect from the maker, unless the latter has a \nreal defense. \n \nIn this chapter, we begin by examining a question especially important to management: personal \nliability for signing company notes and checks. Then we look at the two general types of liability—\ncontract and warranty—introduced in Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". We conclude \nthe chapter by reviewing the ways in which parties are discharged from liability. \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n889 \n \n \n \n22.1 Liability Imposed by Signature: Agents, Authorized and \nUnauthorized \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Recognize what a signature is under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Understand how a person’s signature on an instrument affects liability if the person is an agent, or a \npurported agent, for another. \n \n \nThe liability of an agent who signs commercial paper is one of the most frequently litigated issues in this \narea of law. For example, Igor is an agent (treasurer) of Frank N. Stein, Inc. Igor signs a note showing that \nthe corporation has borrowed $50,000 from First Bank. The company later becomes bankrupt. The \nquestion: Is Igor personally liable on the note? The unhappy treasurer might be sued by the bank—the \nimmediate party with whom he dealt—or by a third party to whom the note was transferred (see Figure \n22.1 \"Signature by Representative\"). \n \nFigure 22.1 Signature by Representative \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n890 \n \nThere are two possibilities regarding an agent who signs commercial paper: the agent was authorized to \ndo so, or the agent was not authorized to do so. First, though, what is a signature? \n \nA “Signature” under the Uniform Commercial Code \nSection 3-401 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides fairly straightforwardly that “a signature \ncan be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name, including \nany trade or assumed name, or by any word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person with the \npresent intention to authenticate a writing.” \n \nLiability of an Agent Who Has Authority to Sign \nAgents often sign instruments on behalf of their principals, and—of course—because a corporation’s \nexistence is a legal fiction (you can’t go up and shake hands with General Motors), corporations can only \nact through their agents. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 3-402(a) of the UCC provides that a person acting (or purporting to act) as an agent who signs an \ninstrument binds the principal to the same extent that the principal would be bound if the signature were \non a simple contract. The drafters of the UCC here punt to the common law of agency: if, under agency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n891 \nlaw, the principal would be bound by the act of the agent, the signature is the authorized signature of the \nprincipal. And the general rule in agency law is that the agent is not liable if he signs his own name and \nmakes clear he is doing so as an agent. In our example, Igor should sign as follows: “Frank N. Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.”",

            "chunk": "3. Know the conditions that must be met before secondary liability attaches. \n \n \nTwo types of liability can attach to those who deal in commercial paper: contract liability and warranty \nliability. Contract liability is based on a party’s signature on the paper. For contract liability purposes, \nsigning parties are divided into two categories: primary parties and secondary parties. \n \nWe discuss here the liability of various parties. You may recall the discussion in Chapter 19 \"Nature and \nForm of Commercial Paper\" about accommodation parties. An accommodation party signs a negotiable \ninstrument in order to lend his name to another party to the instrument. The Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC) provides that such a person “may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor, or indorser” and \nthat in whatever capacity the person signs, he will be liable in that capacity. [1] \n \nLiability of Primary Parties \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n894 \nTwo parties are primarily liable: the maker of a note and the acceptor of a draft. They are required to pay \nby the terms of the instrument itself, and their liability is unconditional. \n \nMaker \nBy signing a promissory note, the maker promises to pay the instrument—that’s the maker’s contract and, \nof course, the whole point to a note. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the note or to \nan indorser that paid the note. [2] \nAcceptor \nRecall that acceptance is the drawee’s signed engagement to honor a draft as presented. The drawee’s \nsignature on the draft is necessary and sufficient to accept, and if that happens, the drawee as acceptor is \nprimarily liable. The acceptance must be written on the draft by some means—any means is good. The \nsignature is usually accompanied by some wording, such as “accepted,” “good,” “I accept.” When a \nbank certifies a check, that is the drawee bank’s acceptance, and the bank as acceptor becomes liable to \nthe holder; the drawer and all indorsers prior to the bank’s acceptance are discharged. So the holder—\nwhether a payee or an indorsee—can look only to the bank, not to the drawer, for payment. [3] If the \ndrawee varies the terms when accepting the draft, it is liable according to the terms as varied. [4] \n \nLiability of Secondary Parties \nUnlike primary liability, secondary liability is conditional, arising only if the primarily liable party fails to \npay. The parties for whom these conditions are significant are the drawers and the indorsers. By virtue of \nUCC Sections 3-414 and 3-415, drawers and indorsers engage to pay the amount of an unaccepted draft to \nany subsequent holder or indorser who takes it up, again, if (this is the conditional part) the (1) the \ninstrument is dishonored and, in some cases, (2) notice of dishonor is given to the drawer or indorser. \n \nDrawer’s Liability \nIf Carlos writes (more properly “draws”) a check to his landlord for $700, Carlos does not expect the \nlandlord to turn around and approach him for the money: Carlos’s bank—the drawee—is supposed to pay \nfrom Carlos’s account. But if the bank dishonors the check—most commonly because of insufficient funds \nto pay it—then Carlos is liable to pay according to the instrument’s terms when he wrote the check or, if it \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n895 \nwas incomplete when he wrote it, according to its terms when completed (subject to some \nlimitations). [5] Under the pre-1997 UCC, Carlos’s liability was conditioned not only upon dishonor but \nalso upon notice of dishonor; however, under the revised UCC, notice is not required for the drawer to be \nliable unless the draft has been accepted and the acceptor is not a bank. Most commonly, if a check \nbounces, the person who wrote it is liable to make it good. \n \nThe drawer of a noncheck draft may disclaim her contractual liability on the instrument by drawing \n“without recourse.” [6] \n \nIndorser’s Liability \nUnder UCC Section 3-415, an indorser promises to pay on the instrument according to its terms if it is \ndishonored or, if it was incomplete when indorsed, according to its terms when completed. The liability \nhere is conditioned upon the indorser’s receipt of notice of dishonor (with some exceptions, noted \ninSection 22.2 \"Contract Liability of Parties\" on contract liability of parties. Indorsers may disclaim \ncontractual liability by indorsing “without recourse.”[7] \n \nConditions Required for Liability \nWe have alluded to the point that secondary parties do not become liable unless the proper conditions are \nmet—there are conditions precedent to liability (i.e., things have to happen before liability “ripens”). \n \nConditions for Liability in General \nThe conditions are slightly different for two classes of instruments. For an unaccepted draft, the drawer’s \nliability is conditioned on (1) presentment and (2) dishonor. For an accepted draft on a nonbank, or for an \nindorser, the conditions are (1) presentment, (2) dishonor, and (3) notice of dishonor. \n \nPresentment \nPresentment occurs when a person entitled to enforce the instrument (creditor)",

[8] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n896 \nThe common-law tort that makes a person who wrongfully takes another’s property liable for that taking \nis conversion—it’s the civil equivalent of theft. The UCC provides that “the law applicable to conversion \nof personal property applies to instruments.” [9] Conversion is relevant here because if an instrument is \npresented for payment or acceptance and the person to whom it is presented refuses to pay, accept, or \nreturn it, the instrument is converted. An instrument is also converted if a person pays an instrument on a \nforged indorsement: a bank that pays a check on a forged indorsement has converted the instrument and \nis liable to the person whose indorsement was forged. There are various permutations on the theme of \nconversion; here is one example from the Official Comment: \n \nA check is payable to the order of A. A indorses it to B and puts it into an envelope addressed to B. \nThe envelope is never delivered to B. Rather, Thief steals the envelope, forges B’s indorsement to \nthe check and obtains payment. Because the check was never delivered to B, the indorsee, B has \nno cause of action for conversion, but A does have such an action. A is the owner of the check. B \nnever obtained rights in the check. If A intended to negotiate the check to B in payment of an \nobligation, that obligation was not affected by the conduct of Thief. B can enforce that obligation. \nThief stole A’s property not B’s. [10] \n \nDishonor \nDishonor generally means failure by the obligor to pay on the instrument when presentment for \npayment is made (but return of an instrument because it has not been properly indorsed does not \nconstitute dishonor). The UCC at Section 3-502 has (laborious) rules governing what constitutes dishonor \nand when dishonor occurs for a note, an unaccepted draft, and an unaccepted documentary draft. (A \ndocumentary draft is a draft to be presented for acceptance or payment if specified documents, \ncertificates, statements, or the like are to be received by the drawee or other payor before acceptance or \npayment of the draft.) \n \n \n \nNotice of Dishonor \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n897 \nAgain, when acceptance or payment is refused after presentment, the instrument is said to be dishonored. \nThe holder has a right of recourse against the drawers and indorsers, but he is usually supposed to give \nnotice of the dishonor. Section 3-503(a) of the UCC requires the holder to give notice to a party before the \nparty can be charged with liability, unless such notice is excused, but the UCC exempts notice in a number \nof circumstances (Section 3-504, discussed in Section 22.2 \"Contract Liability of Parties\" on contract \nliability). The UCC makes giving notice pretty easy: it permits any party who may be compelled to pay the \ninstrument to notify any party who may be liable on it (but each person who is to be charged with liability \nmust actually be notified); notice of dishonor may “be given by any commercially reasonable means \nincluding an oral, written, or electronic communication”; and no specific form of notice is required—it is \n“sufficient if it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument has been \ndishonored or has not been paid or accepted.” [11] Section 3-503(c) sets out time limits when notice of \ndishonor must be given for collecting banks and for other persons. An oral notice is unwise because it \nmight be difficult to prove. Usually, notice of dishonor is given when the instrument is returned with a \nstamp (“NSF”—the dreaded “nonsufficient funds”), a ticket, or a memo. \n \nSuppose—you’ll want to graph this out—Ann signs a note payable to Betty, who indorses it to Carl, who in \nturn indorses it to Darlene. Darlene indorses it to Earl, who presents it to Ann for payment. Ann refuses. \nAnn is the only primary party, so if Earl is to be paid he must give notice of dishonor to one or more of the \nsecondary parties, in this case, the indorsers. He knows that Darlene is rich, so he notifies only Darlene.",

If insolvency proceedings…have been \ninstituted against the party who is expected to pay and the transferor knows it, the concealment of that \nfact amounts to a fraud upon the transferee, and the warranty against knowledge of such proceedings is \nprovided accordingly.” [1] \n \n \n \nPresentment Warranties \nA payor paying or accepting an instrument in effect takes the paper from the party who presents it to the \npayor, and that party has his hand out. In doing so, the presenter makes certain implied promises to the \npayor, who is about to fork over cash (or an acceptance). The UCC distinguishes between warranties made \nby one who presents an unaccepted draft for payment and warranties made by one who presents other \ninstruments for payment. The warranties made by the presenter are as follows. [2] \n \nWarranties Made by One Who Presents an Unaccepted Draft \n1. The presenter is entitled to enforce the draft or to obtain payment or acceptance. This is “in effect a \nwarranty that there are no unauthorized or missing indorsements.” [3] Suppose Thief steals a check \ndrawn by Drawer to Payee and forges Payee’s signature, then presents it to the bank. If the bank pays \nit, the bank cannot charge Drawer’s account because it has not followed Drawer’s order in paying to \nthe wrong person (except in the case of an imposter or fictitious payee). It can, though, go back to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n904 \nThief (fat chance it can find her) on the claim that she breached the warranty of no unauthorized \nindorsement. \n2. There has been no alteration of the instrument. If Thief takes a check and changes the amount from \n$100 to $1,000 and the bank pays it, the bank can recover from Thief $900, the difference between \nthe amount paid by the bank and the amount Drawer (customer) authorized the bank to pay. [4]If the \ndrawee accepts the draft, the same rules apply. \n3. The presenter has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer is unauthorized. If the presenter \ndoesn’t know Drawer’s signature is forged and the drawee pays out on a forged signature, the drawee \nbears the loss. (The bank would be liable for paying out over the forged drawer’s signature: that’s why \nit has the customer’s signature on file.) \n \nThese rules apply—again—to warranties made by the presenter to a drawee paying out on an unaccepted \ndraft. The most common situation would be where a person has a check made out to her and she gets it \ncashed at the drawer’s bank. \n \n \nWarranties Made by One Who Presents Something Other Than an Unaccepted Draft \nIn all other cases, there is only one warranty made by the presenter: that he or she is a person entitled to \nenforce the instrument or obtain payment on it. \n \nThis applies to the presentment of accepted drafts, to the presentment of dishonored drafts made to the \ndrawer or an indorser, and to the presentment of notes. For example, Maker makes a note payable to \nPayee; Payee indorses the note to Indorsee, Indorsee indorses and negotiates the note to Subsequent \nParty. Subsequent Party presents the note to Maker for payment. The Subsequent Party warrants to \nMaker that she is entitled to obtain payment. If she is paid and is not entitled to payment, Maker can sue \nher for breach of that warranty. If the reason she isn’t entitled to payment is because Payee’s signature \nwas forged by Thief, then Maker can go after Thief: the UCC says that “the person obtaining payment \n[Subsequent Party] and a prior transferor [Thief] warrant to the person making payment in good faith \n[Maker] that the warrantor [Subsequent Party] is entitled to enforce the instrument.” [5] Or, again, Drawer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n905 \nmakes the check out to Payee; Payee attempts to cash or deposit the check, but it is dishonored. Payee \npresents the check to Drawer to make it good: Payee warrants he is entitled to payment on it. \n \nWarranties cannot be disclaimed in the case of checks (because, as UCC Section 3-417, Comment 7, puts \nit, “it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be \nexamined by the payor bank”—they’re machine read). But a disclaimer of warranties is permitted as to \nother instruments, just as disclaimers of warranty are usually OK under general contract law. The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake. The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it",

[Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card. Under the agreement’s terms, Martin agreed to bind himself to the \nagreement by signing the signature card. Martin does not dispute that the account agreement was a \nbinding contract, and he does not dispute the account agreement’s terms. \n \nMartin’s account agreement authorized PNC to charge Martin’s account for the value of any item returned \nto PNC unpaid or any item on which PNC did not receive payment. If PNC’s charge-back created an \noverdraft, Martin was required to pay PNC the amount of the overdraft immediately. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n929 \nThe scam of which Martin was a victim falls squarely within the charge-back provision of the account \nagreement. The check was returned to PNC unpaid. PNC charged Martin’s account, leaving it with an \noverdraft. Martin was obliged to pay PNC immediately. \n \nAs with the breach-of-transfer-warranties claim, Martin cannot defend against the breach-of-contract \nclaim by arguing that PNC made a mistake. The account agreement authorized PNC to charge back \nMartin’s account “even if the amount of the item has already been made available to you.” The account \nagreement, as a result, placed the risk of loss on Martin. Any mistake on PNC’s part was immaterial \nbecause PNC always had the right to charge back Martin’s account. [Citation] \n \nC. Martin’s Counterclaims \nMartin has asserted counterclaims for violations of various Uniform Commercial Code provisions; \nnegligence and failure to exercise ordinary care; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; detrimental reliance; conversion; and \nnegligent retention and supervision. Martin argues that “[t]o the extent that either party should be \nentitled to summary judgment in this case, it would be Martin with respect to his counterclaims against \nPNC.” Martin, however, has not moved for summary judgment on his counterclaims, and the court does \nnot address them on PNC’s motion. \n \nD. Damages \nPNC’s recovery under both theories of liability is contingent on PNC’s demonstrating that it acted in good \nfaith. PNC may recover for breach of the transfer warranties only if it took the check in good faith. § 3-\n416(b). Moreover, PNC must satisfy the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which Kentucky \nlaw incorporates in the account agreement. [Citation] Good faith, under both theories, means honesty in \nfact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. That means “contracts impose \non the parties thereto a duty to do everything necessary to carry them out.” [Citation] \n \nThe undisputed evidence establishes that PNC acted in good faith. PNC accepted deposit of Martin’s \ncheck, attempted to present the check for payment at First Century Bank, and charged back Martin’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n930 \naccount when the check was dishonored. Martin cannot claim that PNC lacked good faith and fair dealing \nwhen PNC took actions permitted under the contract. [Citation] Although PNC might have had the ability \nto investigate the authenticity of the check before crediting Martin’s account, PNC bore no such obligation \nbecause Martin warranted that the check was authentic. [UCC] § 3-416(a). Friedman’s and Jennewein’s \nstatements do not impute a lack of good faith to PNC, even if Martin could support the statements with \ncompetent evidence. The Uniform Commercial Code and the account agreement place the risk of loss on \nMartin, even if PNC made a mistake. \n \nMartin suggests that an insurance carrier might have already reimbursed PNC for the loss. Martin, \nhowever, presents no evidence of reimbursement, which PNC, presumably, would have disclosed in \ndiscovery. \n \nPNC, therefore, may recover from Martin the overdraft value of $124,313.01, which is the loss PNC \nsuffered as a result of Martin’s breach of the transfer warranties and breach of contract.

Although histories of banking dwell on the relationship between \nbanks and the national government, the banking law that governs the daily operation of checking \naccounts is state based—Article 4 of the UCC. The enormous increase in noncheck banking has given \nrise to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, a federal law. \n \n \n \n \n \n23.1 Banks and Their Customers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how checks move, both traditionally and electronically. \n2. Know how Article 4 governs the relationship between a bank and its customers. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n939 \n \n \nThe Traditional Bank Collection Process \nThe Traditional System in General \nOnce people mostly paid for things with cash: actual bills. That is obviously not very convenient or safe: a \nlost ten-dollar bill is almost certainly gone, and carrying around large quantities of cash is dangerous \n(probably only crooks do much of that). Today a person might go for weeks without reaching for a bill \n(except maybe to get change for coins to put in the parking meter). And while it is indisputable that \nelectronic payment is replacing paper payment, the latter is still very significant. Here is an excerpt from a \nFederal Reserve Report on the issue: \n \nIn 2008, U.S. consumers had more payment instruments to choose from than ever before: four \ntypes of paper instruments—cash, check, money order, and travelers checks; three types of \npayment cards—debit, credit, and prepaid; and two electronic instruments—online banking bill \npayment (OBBP) and electronic bank account deductions (EBAD) using their bank account \nnumbers. The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card. More consumers now have debit cards than credit cards (80.2 percent versus 78.3 \npercent), and consumers use debit cards more often than cash, credit cards, or checks \nindividually. However, paper instruments are still popular and account for 36.5 percent of \nconsumer payments. Most consumers have used newer electronic payments at some point, but \nthese only account for 9.7 percent of consumer payments. Security and ease of use are the \ncharacteristics of payment instruments that consumers rate as most important. [1] \n \nAmericans still wrote some thirty billion checks in 2006. [2] You can readily imagine how complex the \nbank collection process must be to cope with such a flood of paper. Every check written must eventually \ncome back to the bank on which it is drawn, after first having been sent to the landlord, say, to pay rent, \nthen to the landlord’s bank, and from there through a series of intermediate banks and collection centers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n940 \nTerminology \nTo trace the traditional check-collection process, it is necessary to understand the terminology used. The \nbank upon which a check is written is the payor bank (the drawee bank). The depository bank is the \none the payee deposits the check into. Two terms are used to describe the various banks that may handle \nthe check after it is written: collecting banks and intermediary banks. All banks that handle the check—\nexcept the payor bank—are collecting banks (including the depository \nbank); intermediary banks are all the collecting banks except the payor and depository banks. A bank \ncan take on more than one role: Roger in Seattle writes a check on his account at Seattle Bank and mails it \nto Julia in Los Angeles in payment for merchandise; Julia deposits it in her account at Bank of L.A. Bank \nof L.A. is a depository bank and a collecting bank. Any other bank through which the check travels (except \nthe two banks already mentioned) is an intermediary bank. \n \nCollection Process between Customers of the Same Bank \nIf the depository bank is also the payor bank (about 30% of all checks), the check is called an “on-us” item \nand UCC 4-215(e)(2) provides that—if the check is not dishonored—it is available by the payee “at the \nopening of the bank’s second banking day following receipt of the item.” Roger writes a check to Matthew, \nboth of whom have accounts at Seattle Bank; Matthew deposits the check on Monday. On Wednesday the \ncheck is good for Matthew (he may have been given “provisional credit” before then, as discussed below, \nthe bank could subtract the money from his account if Roger didn’t have enough to cover the check). \n \nCollection Process between Customers of Different Banks \nRoger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. Julia deposits it in her account at \nL.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank must somehow present the check to Seattle Bank either directly \nor through intermediary banks.

When the \npayor bank—Seattle Bank—gets the check it must pay it, unless the check is dishonored or returned (UCC \n4-302). \n \nPhysical Movement of Checks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n941 \nThe physical movement of checks—such as it still occurs—is handled by three possible systems. \n \nThe Federal Reserve System’s regional branches process checks for banks holding accounts with them. \nThe Feds charge for the service, and prior to 2004 it regularly included check collection, air \ntransportation of checks to the Reserve Bank (hired out to private contractors) and ground transportation \ndelivery of checks to paying banks. Reserve Banks handle about 27 percent of US checks, but the air \nservice is decreasing with “Check 21,” a federal law discussed below, that allows electronic transmission of \nchecks. \n \nCorrespondent banks are banks that have formed “partnerships” with other banks in order to \nexchange checks and payments directly, bypassing the Federal Reserve and its fees. Outside banks may go \nthrough a correspondent bank to exchange checks and payments with one of its partners. \n \nCorrespondent banks may also form a clearinghouse corporation, in which members exchange \nchecks and payments in bulk, instead of on a check-by-check basis, which can be inefficient considering \nthat each bank might receive thousands of checks in a day. The clearinghouse banks save up the checks \ndrawn on other members and exchange them on a daily basis. The net payments for these checks are often \nsettled through Fedwire, a Federal Reserve Board electronic funds transfer (EFT) system that handles \nlarge-scale check settlement among US banks. Correspondent banks and clearinghouse corporations \nmake up the private sector of check clearing, and together they handle about 43 percent of US checks. \n \nThe Electronic System: Check 21 Act \nRationale for the “Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act” \nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, Congress felt with renewed urgency that banks needed to present \nand clear checks in a way not dependent upon the physical transportation of the paper instruments by air \nand ground, in case such transportation facilities were disrupted. The federal Check Clearing for the 21st \nCentury Act (Public Law 108-100)—more commonly referred to as “Check 21 Act”—became effective in \n2004. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n942 \nBasic Idea of Check 21 Act \nCheck 21 Act provides the legal basis for the electronic transportation of check data. A bank scans the \ncheck. The data on the check is already encoded in electronically readable numbers and the data, now \nseparated (“truncated”) from the paper instrument (which may be destroyed), is transmitted for \nprocessing. “The Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument, called a substitute check, to replace the \noriginal check. A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that is suitable for \nautomated processing in the same manner as the original check. The Act permits banks to provide \nsubstitute checks in place of original checks to subsequent parties in the check processing stream.…Any \nfinancial institution in the check clearing process can truncate the original check and create a substitute \ncheck. [3] However, in the check collection process it is not required that the image be converted to a \nsubstitute check: the electronic image itself may suffice. \n \nFor example, suppose Roger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. and mails it \nto her. Julia deposits it in her account at L.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank truncates the check \n(again, scans it and destroys the original) and transmits the data to Seattle Bank for presentation and \npayment. If for any reason Roger, or any appropriate party, wants a paper version, a substitute check will \nbe created (see Figure 23.1 \"Substitute Check Front and Back\"). Most often, though, that is not necessary: \nRoger does not receive the actual cancelled checks he wrote in his monthly statement as he did formerly. \nHe receives instead a statement listing paid checks he’s written and a picture of the check (not a substitute \ncheck) is available to him online through his bank’s website. Or he may receive his monthly statement",

You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation. \n3. Recourse for loss or theft. If you notify the issuer of your EFT card within two business days after \nlearning that your card (or code number) is missing or stolen, your liability is limited to $50. If you \nfail to notify the issuer in this time, your liability can go as high as $500. More daunting is the \nprospect of loss if you fail within sixty days to notify the financial institution of an unauthorized \ntransfer noted on your statement: after sixty days of receipt, your liability is unlimited.

The act also requires the financial institution to provide you \nwith specific information concerning your rights and responsibilities (including how to report losses \nand thefts, resolve errors, and stop payment of preauthorized transfers). A financial institution may \nsend you a card that is “not valid for use” and that you alone have the power to validate if you choose \nto do so, after the institution has verified that you are the person for whom the card was intended. \n \n \n \nLiability of the Financial Institution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n955 \nThe financial institution’s failure to make an electronic fund transfer, in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of an account, in the correct amount or in a timely manner when properly instructed to do so \nby the consumer makes it liable for all damages proximately caused to the consumer, except where \n \n1) the consumer’s account has insufficient funds; \n2) the funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting such transfer; \n3) such transfer would exceed an established credit limit; \n4) an electronic terminal has insufficient cash to complete the transaction; or \n5) a circumstance beyond its control, where it exercised reasonable care to prevent such an \noccurrence, or exercised such diligence as the circumstances required. \n \nEnforcement of the Act \nA host of federal regulatory agencies oversees enforcement of the act. These include the Comptroller of the \nCurrency (national banks), Federal Reserve District Bank (state member banks), Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation regional director (nonmember insured banks), Federal Home Loan Bank Board \nsupervisory agent (members of the FHLB system and savings institutions insured by the Federal Savings \n& Loan Insurance Corporation), National Credit Union Administration (federal credit unions), Securities \n& Exchange Commission (brokers and dealers), and the Federal Trade Commission (retail and \ndepartment stores) consumer finance companies, all nonbank debit card issuers, and certain other \nfinancial institutions. Additionally, consumers are empowered to sue (individually or as a class) for actual \ndamages caused by any EFT system, plus penalties ranging from $100 to $1,000.

In order to pay a supplier, Supplies Ltd., in China, Widgets instructs First \nBank to pay $6 million to the account of Supplies Ltd. in China Bank. In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and \nSupplies Ltd. is still the beneficiary. This transaction is depicted in Figure 23.3 \"Funds Transfer\". In some \ntransactions there may also be one or more “intermediary banks” between First and Second Bank. \n \nFigure 23.3 Funds Transfer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n959 \n \n \nFrequently Occurring Legal Issues in Funds Transfers \nThree legal issues that frequently arise in funds transfer litigation are addressed in Article 4A and might \nbe mentioned here. \n \nResponsibility for Unauthorized Payments \nFirst, who is responsible for unauthorized payment orders? The usual practice is for banks and their \ncustomers to agree to security procedures for the verification of payment orders. If a bank establishes a \ncommercially reasonable procedure, complies with that procedure, and acts in good faith and according to \nits agreement with the customer, the customer is bound by an unauthorized payment order. There is, \nhowever, an important exception to this rule. A customer will not be liable when the order is from a \nperson unrelated to its business operations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n960 \nError by Sender \nSecond, who is responsible when the sender makes a mistake—for instance, in instructing payment \ngreater than what was intended? The general rule is that the sender is bound by its own error. But in cases \nwhere the error would have been discovered had the bank complied with its security procedure, the \nreceiving bank is liable for the excess over the amount intended by the sender, although the bank is \nallowed to recover this amount from the beneficiary. \n \nBank Mistake in Transferring Funds \nThird, what are the consequences when the bank makes a mistake in transferring funds? Suppose, for \nexample, that Widgets (in the previous situation) instructed payment of $2 million but First Bank in turn \ninstructed payment of $20 million. First Bank would be entitled to only $2 million from Widgets and \nwould then attempt to recover the remaining $18 million from Supplies Ltd. If First Bank had instructed \npayment to the wrong beneficiary, Widgets would have no liability and the bank would be responsible for \nrecovering the entire payment. Unless the parties agree otherwise, however, a bank that improperly \nexecutes a payment order is not liable for consequential damages. \n \nLetters of Credit \nBecause international trade involves risks not usually encountered in domestic trade—government control \nof exports, imports, and currency; problems in verifying goods’ quality and quantity; disruptions caused \nby adverse weather, war; and so on—merchants have over the years devised means to minimize these \nrisks, most notably the letter of credit (“LC”). Here are discussed the definition of letters of credit, the \nsource of law governing them, how they work as payments for exports and as payments for imports. \n \nDefinition \nA letter of credit is a statement by a bank (or other financial institution) that it will pay a specified sum \nof money to specific persons if certain conditions are met. Or, to rephrase, it is a letter issued by a bank \nauthorizing the bearer to draw a stated amount of money from the issuing bank (or its branches, or other \nassociated banks or agencies). Originally, a letter of credit was quite literally that—a letter addressed by \nthe buyer’s bank to the seller’s bank stating that the former could vouch for their good customer, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n961 \nbuyer, and that it would pay the seller in case of the buyer’s default. An LC is issued by a bank on behalf of \nits creditworthy customers, whose application for the credit has been approved by that bank. \n \nSource of Law \nLetters of credit are governed by both international and US domestic law. \n \nInternational Law \nMany countries (including the United States) have bodies of law governing letters of credit. Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce.

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount. On Thursday, the Bank deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade’s account. \n \nIn the meanwhile, Meade contacted Greg Scott at the Lumber Company regarding his dissatisfaction with \nthe barn. Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn.

However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn. Baker charged Meade approximately three hundred dollars to make \nthe necessary repairs.

Upon \nremand, the trial court should grant in part the Bank’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \nas it relates to damages and consider the Bank’s motion for a new trial only on the issue of damages[.…] \nAccordingly, we sustain the Banks fourth and fifth assignments of error in part. \n \nVI. \nIn conclusion, we find that the trial court did not err in denying the Bank’s motions for summary \njudgment and for directed verdict. However, we find that the trial court erred in permitting Meade to \ntestify as to his court costs, attorney fees and deposition costs. Additionally, we find that the trial court \nerred in totally denying the Bank’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, as the amount of \ndamages awarded by the jury is not supported by sufficient evidence in the record. Accordingly, we affirm \nthe judgment of the trial court as to liability, but reverse the judgment of the trial court as to the issue of \ndamages, and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n971 \n1.

Rogers \n912 So.2d 116 (Miss. 2005) \n \nWaller, J. \n \nThis appeal involves an issue of first impression in Mississippi—the interpretation of [Mississippi’s UCC \n4-406], which imposes duties on banks and their customers insofar as forgeries are concerned. \n \n \nFacts \nNeal D. and Helen K. Rogers maintained four checking accounts with the Union Planters Bank in \nGreenville, Washington County, Mississippi.…The Rogers were both in their eighties when the events \nwhich gave rise to this lawsuit took place.[1] After Neal became bedridden, Helen hired Jackie Reese to \nhelp her take care of Neal and to do chores and errands. \n \nIn September of 2000, Reese began writing checks on the Rogers’ four accounts and forged Helen’s name \non the signature line. Some of the checks were made out to “cash,” some to “Helen K. Rogers,” and some \nto “Jackie Reese.” The following chart summarizes the forgeries to each account: \n \nAccount Number Beginning \nEnding \nNumber of Checks Amount of Checks \n54282309 \n11/27/2000 6/18/2001 46 \n$16,635.00 \n0039289441 \n9/27/2000 \n1/25/2001 10 \n$2,701.00 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n972 \nAccount Number Beginning \nEnding \nNumber of Checks Amount of Checks \n6100110922 \n11/29/2000 8/13/2001 29 \n$9,297.00 \n6404000343 \n11/20/2000 8/16/2001 83 \n$29,765.00 \nTotal \n \n \n168 \n$58,398.00 \n \nNeal died in late May of 2001. Shortly thereafter, the Rogers’ son, Neal, Jr., began helping Helen with \nfinancial matters. Together they discovered that many bank statements were missing and that there was \nnot as much money in the accounts as they had thought. In June of 2001, they contacted Union Planters \nand asked for copies of the missing bank statements. In September of 2001, Helen was advised by Union \nPlanters to contact the police due to forgeries made on her accounts. More specific dates and facts leading \nup to the discovery of the forgeries are not found in the record. \n \nSubsequently, criminal charges were brought against Reese. (The record does not reveal the disposition of \nthe criminal proceedings against Reese.) In the meantime, Helen filed suit against Union Planters, \nalleging conversion (unlawful payment of forged checks) and negligence. After a trial, the jury awarded \nHelen $29,595 in damages, and the circuit court entered judgment accordingly. From this judgment, \nUnion Planters appeals. \n \nDiscussion \n…II.

Procedural Posture \nPlaintiff, Commerce Bank/Delaware North America (“Commerce”) initially filed a civil complaint against \ndefendant Natasha J. Brown (“Brown”) on October 28, 2005. Commerce seeks judgment in the amount of \n$4.020.11 plus costs and interest and alleges that Brown maintained a checking account with Commerce \nand has been unjustly enriched by $4,020.11.… \n \nThe defendant, Brown…denied all allegations of the complaint. As an affirmative defense Brown claims \nthe transaction for which plaintiff seeks to recover a money judgment were made by means of an ATM \nMachine using a debit card issued by the defendant. On January 16, 2005 Brown asserts that she became \naware of the fraudulent transactions and timely informed the plaintiff of the facts on January 16, 2005. \nBrown asserts that she also requested Commerce in her answer to investigate the matter and to close her \naccount. Based upon these facts, Brown asserts a maximum liability on her own part from $50.00 to \n$500.00 in accordance with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) 15 U.S.C. § 1693(g) and regulation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n976 \n(e), 12 CFR 205.6. [Commerce Bank withdrew its complaint at trial, leaving only the defendant’s counter-\nclaim in issue.] \n \nDefendant Brown asserts [that] defendant failed to investigate and violated EFTA and is therefore liable \nto the plaintiff for money damages citing [EFTA]. \n \nII. The Facts \nBrown was the only witness called at trial. Brown is twenty-seven years old and has been employed by \nWilmington Trust as an Administrative Assistant for the past three years. Brown previously opened a \nchecking account with Commerce and was issued a debit/ATM card by Commerce which was in her \npossession in December 2004. Brown, on or about January 14, 2005 went to Commerce to charge a $5.00 \ndebit to the card at her lunch-break was informed that there was a deficiency balance in the checking \naccount.

Clearly, Commerce failed to investigate the unauthorized charges pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1693(h). \nNor did Commerce close the account as detailed in Defendant’s Exhibit No. 1.

The Court finds $50.00 is the appropriate liability for Brown \nfor the monies charged on her account as set forth within the above statute because she timely notified, in \nperson, Commerce on January 16, 2005. Brown also requested Commerce to close her checking account. \nBased upon the trial record, defendant has proven by a preponderance of the evidence damages of \n$1,000.00 as set forth in the above statute, 15 U.S.C. § 1693(m). \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Helen Rogers died after Union Planters filed this appeal. \nWe have substituted Helen’s estate as appellee. \n[2] Since there was a series of forged checks, it is reasonable to assume that Reese intercepted the bank \nstatements before Rogers could inspect them. However, Union Planters cannot be held liable for Reese’s \nfraudulent concealment. \n[3] Actually, it was Union Planters that notified Rogers that there had been forgeries, as opposed to Rogers’ \ndiscovering the forgeries herself. \n \n \n23.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nTraditionally when a customer wrote a check (on the payor bank) and the payee deposited it into his \naccount (at the depository bank), the check was physically routed by means of ground and air \ntransportation to the various intermediary banks until it was physically presented to the payor bank for \nfinal settlement. The federal Check 21 Act (2004) promotes changes in this process by allowing banks to \nprocess electronic images of customers’ checks instead of the actual paper instrument: the data on the \ncheck is truncated (stripped) from the instrument and the data are transmitted. The original check can be \ndigitally recreated by the making of a “substitute check.” Merchants—indeed, anyone with a check scanner \nand a computer—can also process electronic data from checks to debit the writer’s account and credit the \nmerchant’s instantly. \n \nIn addition to Check 21 Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 also facilitates electronic banking. It \nprimarily addresses the uses of credit and debit cards. Under this law, the electronic terminal must \nprovide a receipt of transfer. The financial institution must follow certain procedures on being notified of \nerrors, the customer’s liability is limited to $50 if a card or code number is wrongfully used and the \ninstitution has been notified, and an employer or government agency can compel acceptance of salary or \ngovernment benefits by EFT. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n981 \nArticle 4 of the UCC—state law, of course—governs a bank’s relationship with its customers.

Understand how consumers’ credit records are maintained and may be corrected. \n \n \nThe Cost of Credit \nLenders, whether banks or retailers, are not free to charge whatever they wish for credit. Usury laws \nestablish a maximum rate of lawful interest. The penalties for violating usury laws vary from state to state. \nThe heaviest penalties are loss of both principal and interest, or loss of a multiple of the interest the \ncreditor charged. The courts often interpret these laws stringently, so that even if the impetus for a \nusurious loan comes from the borrower, the contract can be avoided, as demonstrated in Matter of Dane’s \nEstate (Section 24.3 \"Cases\"). \n \nSome states have eliminated interest rate limits altogether. In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule. Here \nare some common exceptions: \n \n• \nBusiness loans. In many states, businesses may be charged any interest rate, although some states \nlimit this exception to incorporated businesses. \n• \nMortgage loans. Mortgage loans are often subject to special usury laws. The allowable interest \nrates vary, depending on whether a first mortgage or a subordinate mortgage is given, or whether \nthe loan is insured or provided by a federal agency, among other variables. \n• \nSecond mortgages and home equity loans by licensed consumer loan companies. \n• \nCredit card and other retail installment debt. The interest rate for these is governed by the law of \nthe state where the credit card company does business. (That’s why the giant Citibank, otherwise \nheadquartered in New York City, runs its credit card division out of South Dakota, which has no \nusury laws for credit cards.) \n• \nConsumer leasing. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n988 \n• \n“Small loans” such as payday loans and pawnshop loans. \n• \nLease-purchases on personal property.

In 1970, Congress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to give consumers access to their credit files in order \nto correct errors. \n \nUnder this statute, an applicant denied credit has the right to be told the name and address of the credit \nbureau (called “consumer reporting agency” in the act) that prepared the report on which the denial was \nbased. (The law covers reports used to screen insurance and job applicants as well as to determine \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n995 \ncreditworthiness.) The agency must list the nature and substance of the information (except medical \ninformation) and its sources (unless they contributed to an investigative-type report). A credit report lists \nsuch information as name, address, employer, salary history, loans outstanding, and the like. An \ninvestigative-type report is one that results from personal interviews and may contain nonfinancial \ninformation, like drinking and other personal habits, character, or participation in dangerous sports. \nSince the investigators rely on talks with neighbors and coworkers, their reports are usually subjective and \ncan often be misleading and inaccurate. \n \nThe agency must furnish the consumer the information free if requested within thirty days of rejection \nand must also specify the name and address of anyone who has received the report within the preceding \nsix months (two years if furnished for employment purposes). \n \nIf the information turns out to be inaccurate, the agency must correct its records; if investigative material \ncannot be verified, it must be removed from the file. Those to whom it was distributed must be notified of \nthe changes. When the agency and the consumer disagree about the validity of the information, the \nconsumer’s version must be placed in the file and included in future distributions of the report. After \nseven years, any adverse information must be removed (ten years in the case of bankruptcy). A person is \nentitled to one free copy of his or her credit report from each of the three main national credit bureaus \nevery twelve months. If a reporting agency fails to correct inaccurate information in a reasonable time, it \nis liable to the consumer for $1,000 plus attorneys’ fees. \n \nUnder the FCRA, any person who obtains information from a credit agency under false pretenses is \nsubject to criminal and civil penalties. The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. See Rodgers \nv. McCullough inSection 24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving use of information from a credit report. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCredit is an important part of the US economy, and there are various laws regulating its availability and \ndisclosure. Usury laws prohibit charging excessive interest rates, though the laws are riddled with exceptions. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n996 \nThe disclosure of credit costs is regulated by the Truth in Lending Act of 1969, the Consumer Leasing Act of \n1988, the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1989, and the Credit Card Accountability, \nResponsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (these latter three are amendments to the TILA). Some states have \nadopted the Uniform Consumer Credit Code as well. Two major laws prohibit invidious discrimination in the \ngranting of credit: the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 \n(addressing the problem of redlining). The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 governs the collection and use of \nconsumer credit information held by credit bureaus. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. The penalty for usury varies from state to state.

The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought. In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional. [2] \n \nWage Assignment \nA wage assignment is an agreement by an employee that a creditor may take future wages as security \nfor a loan or to pay an existing debt. With a wage assignment, the creditor can collect directly from the \nemployer. However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977. \n \nThis law regulates the manner by which third-party collection agencies conduct their business. It covers \ncollection of all personal, family, and household debts by collection agencies. It does not deal with \ncollection by creditors themselves; the consumer’s remedy for abusive debt collection by the creditor is in \ntort law. \n \nUnder the FDCPA, the third-party collector may contact the debtor only during reasonable hours and not \nat work if the debtor’s employer prohibits it. The debtor may write the collector to cease contact, in which \ncase the agency is prohibited from further contact (except to confirm that there will be no further contact). \nA written denial that money is owed stops the bill collector for thirty days, and he can resume again only \nafter the debtor is sent proof of the debt.

Here, since both sides concede that the note \nevidences the complete agreement between the parties, we cannot aid appellant by reliance upon the \npresumption that he did not make the loan at a usurious rate [Citation]. The terms of the loan are not in \ndispute. Thus, the note itself establishes, on its face, clear evidence of usury. There is no requirement of a \nspecific intent to violate the usury statute. A general intent to charge more than the legal rate as evidenced \nby the note, is all that is needed. If the lender intends to take and receive a rate in excess of the legal \npercentage at the time the note is made, the statute condemns the act and mandates its cancellation \n[Citation]. The showing, as here, that the note reserves to the lender an illegal rate of interest satisfies \nrespondents’ burden of proving a usurious loan. \n \nNext, where the rate of interest on the face of a note is in excess of the legal rate, it cannot be argued that \nsuch a loan may be saved because the borrower prompted the loan or even set the rate.

A biological male, he was dressed in traditionally \nfeminine attire. He requested a loan application from Norma Brunelle, a bank employee. Brunelle asked \nRosa for identification. Rosa produced three forms of photo identification: (1) a Massachusetts \nDepartment of Public Welfare Card; (2) a Massachusetts Identification Card; and (3) a Money Stop Check \nCashing ID Card. Brunelle looked at the identification cards and told Rosa that she would not provide him \nwith a loan application until he “went home and changed.” She said that he had to be dressed like one of \nthe identification cards in which he appeared in more traditionally male attire before she would provide \nhim with a loan application and process his loan request. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1006 \n \nII. \nRosa sued the Bank for violations of the ECOA and various Massachusetts antidiscrimination statutes. \nRosa charged that “[b]y requiring [him] to conform to sex stereotypes before proceeding with the credit \ntransaction, [the Bank] unlawfully discriminated against [him] with respect to an aspect of a credit \ntransaction on the basis of sex.” He claims to have suffered emotional distress, including anxiety, \ndepression, humiliation, and extreme embarrassment.

Collateral is—again—property that \nis subject to the security interest. It can be divided into four broad categories: goods, intangible property, \nindispensable paper, and other types of collateral. \n \nGoods \nTangible property as collateral is goods. Goods means “all things that are movable when a security interest \nattaches. The term includes (i) fixtures, (ii) standing timber that is to be cut and removed under a \nconveyance or contract for sale, (iii) the unborn young of animals, (iv) crops grown, growing, or to be \ngrown, even if the crops are produced on trees, vines, or bushes, and (v) manufactured homes. The term \nalso includes a computer program embedded in goods.” [8] Goods are divided into several subcategories; \nsix are taken up here. \n \nConsumer Goods \nThese are “goods used or bought primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” [9] \n \nInventory \n“Goods, other than farm products, held by a person for sale or lease or consisting of raw materials, works \nin progress, or material consumed in a business.” [10] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1025 \n \nFarm Products \n“Crops, livestock, or other supplies produced or used in farming operations,” including aquatic goods \nproduced in aquaculture. [11] \n \nEquipment \nThis is the residual category, defined as “goods other than inventory, farm products, or consumer \ngoods.” [12] \n \nFixtures \nThese are “goods that have become so related to particular real property that an interest in them arises \nunder real property law.” [13] Examples would be windows, furnaces, central air conditioning, and \nplumbing fixtures—items that, if removed, would be a cause for significant reconstruction. \n \nAccession \nThese are “goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that the identity of the \noriginal goods is lost.” [14] A new engine installed in an old automobile is an accession. \n \nIntangible Property \nTwo types of collateral are neither goods nor indispensible paper: accounts and general intangibles. \n \nAccounts \nThis type of intangible property includes accounts receivable (the right to payment of money), insurance \npolicy proceeds, energy provided or to be provided, winnings in a lottery, health-care-insurance \nreceivables, promissory notes, securities, letters of credit, and interests in business entities. [15] Often there \nis something in writing to show the existence of the right—such as a right to receive the proceeds of \nsomebody else’s insurance payout—but the writing is merely evidence of the right. The paper itself doesn’t \nhave to be delivered for the transfer of the right to be effective; that’s done by assignment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1026 \nGeneral Intangibles \nGeneral intangibles refers to “any personal property, including things in action, other than accounts, \ncommercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents, goods, instruments, investment property, letter-of-\ncredit rights, letters of credit, money, and oil, gas, or other minerals before extraction.” General \nintangibles include payment intangibles and software. [16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse",

            "chunk": "The “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common \nfor the creditor to have possession of—actually or virtually—certified securities, deposit accounts, \nelectronic chattel paper, investment property, or other such paper or electronic evidence of value. [24] \n \nAgain, Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\" diagrams the attachment, showing the necessary elements: the \ncreditor gives value, the debtor has rights in collateral, and there is a security agreement signed \n(authenticated) by the debtor. If the debtor defaults, the creditor’s “hand” will grab (repossess) the \ncollateral. \n \nPerfection of the Security Interest \nAs between the debtor and the creditor, attachment is fine: if the debtor defaults, the creditor will \nrepossess the goods and—usually—sell them to satisfy the outstanding obligation. But unless an additional \nset of steps is taken, the rights of the secured party might be subordinated to the rights of other secured \nparties, certain lien creditors, bankruptcy trustees, and buyers who give value and who do not know of the \nsecurity interest. Perfection is the secured party’s way of announcing the security interest to the rest of \nthe world. It is the secured party’s claim on the collateral. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1032 \nThere are five ways a creditor may perfect a security interest: (1) by filing a financing statement, (2) by \ntaking or retaining possession of the collateral, (3) by taking control of the collateral, (4) by taking control \ntemporarily as specified by the UCC, or (5) by taking control automatically. \n \nPerfection by Filing \n“Except as otherwise provided…a financing statement must be filed to perfect all security agreements.” [25] \n \nThe Financing Statement \nA financing statement is a simple notice showing the creditor’s general interest in the collateral. It is \nwhat’s filed to establish the creditor’s “dibs.” \n \nContents of the Financing Statement \nIt may consist of the security agreement itself, as long as it contains the information required by the UCC, \nbut most commonly it is much less detailed than the security agreement: it “indicates merely that a person \nmay have a security interest in the collateral[.]…Further inquiry from the parties concerned will be \nnecessary to disclose the full state of affairs.” [26] The financing statement must provide the following \ninformation: \n \n• \nThe debtor’s name. Financing statements are indexed under the debtor’s name, so getting that \ncorrect is important. Section 9-503 of the UCC describes what is meant by “name of debtor.” \n• \nThe secured party’s name. \n• \nAn “indication” of what collateral is covered by the financing statement.[27] It may describe the \ncollateral or it may “indicate that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal \nproperty” (such generic references are not acceptable in the security agreement but are OK in the \nfinancing statement). [28] If the collateral is real-property-related, covering timber to be cut or \nfixtures, it must include a description of the real property to which the collateral is related. [29] \n \nThe form of the financing statement may vary from state to state, but see Figure 25.3 \"UCC-1 Financing \nStatement\" for a typical financing statement. Minor errors or omissions on the form will not make it \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1033 \nineffective, but the debtor’s signature is required unless the creditor is authorized by the debtor to make \nthe filing without a signature, which facilitates paperless filing. [30] \n \nFigure 25.3 UCC-1 Financing Statement \n \n \nDuration of the Financing Statement \nGenerally, the financing statement is effective for five years; a continuation statement may be filed \nwithin six months before the five-year expiration date, and it is good for another five \nyears. [31] Manufactured-home filings are good for thirty years. When the debtor’s obligation is satisfied, \nthe secured party files a termination statement if the collateral was consumer goods; otherwise—upon \ndemand—the secured party sends the debtor a termination statement.

[32] \n \nDebtor Moves out of State \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1034 \nThe UCC also has rules for continued perfection of security interests when the debtor—whether an \nindividual or an association (corporation)—moves from one state to another. Generally, an interest \nremains perfected until the earlier of when the perfection would have expired or for four months after the \ndebtor moves to a new jurisdiction. [33] \n \nWhere to File the Financing Statement \nFor most real-estate-related filings—ore to be extracted from mines, agricultural collateral, and fixtures—\nthe place to file is with the local office that files mortgages, typically the county auditor’s office. [34] For \nother collateral, the filing place is as duly authorized by the state. In some states, that is the office of the \nSecretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that \nmaintains the state’s filing system. [35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or \nher primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered \norganization. [36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is \nalready encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office \nwill provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available \nfor at least some types of collateral. \n \nExemptions \nSome transactions are exempt from the filing provision. The most important category of exempt collateral \nis that covered by state certificate of title laws. For example, many states require automobile owners to \nobtain a certificate of title from the state motor vehicle office. Most of these states provide that it is not \nnecessary to file a financing statement in order to perfect a security interest in an automobile. The reason \nis that the motor vehicle regulations require any security interests to be stated on the title, so that anyone \nattempting to buy a car in which a security interest had been created would be on notice when he took the \nactual title certificate. [37] \n \nTemporary Perfection \nThe UCC provides that certain types of collateral are automatically perfected but only for a while: “A \nsecurity interest in certificated securities, or negotiable documents, or instruments is perfected without \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1035 \nfiling or the taking of possession for a period of twenty days from the time it attaches to the extent that it \narises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement.”[38] Similar temporary perfection \ncovers negotiable documents or goods in possession of a bailee, and when a security certificate or \ninstrument is delivered to the debtor for sale, exchange, presentation, collection, enforcement, renewal, or \nregistration. [39] After the twenty-day period, perfection would have to be by one of the other methods \nmentioned here. \n \nPerfection by Possession \nA secured party may perfect the security interest by possession where the collateral is negotiable \ndocuments, goods, instruments, money, tangible chattel paper, or certified securities. [40] This is a pledge \nof assets (mentioned in the example of the stamp collection). No security agreement is required for \nperfection by possession. \n \nA variation on the theme of pledge is field warehousing. When the pawnbroker lends money, he takes \npossession of the goods—the watch, the ring, the camera. But when large manufacturing concerns wish to \nborrow against their inventory, taking physical possession is not necessarily so easy. The bank does not \nwish to have shipped to its Wall Street office several tons of copper mined in Colorado. Bank employees \nperhaps could go west to the mine and take physical control of the copper, but banks are unlikely to \nemploy people and equipment necessary to build a warehouse on the spot. Thus this so-called field pledge \nis rare. \n \nMore common is the field warehouse. The field warehouse can take one of two forms. An independent \ncompany can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—\nthus establishing physical control of the collateral. Or the independent company can lease the warehouse \nfacilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody. Either \nway, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service. The field warehouse then \nsegregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to",

The lender is thus assured of a security interest in the collateral. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1036 \nPerfection by Control \n“A security interest in investment property, deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic chattel \npaper may be perfected by control of the collateral.” [41] “Control” depends on what the collateral is. If it’s a \nchecking account, for example, the bank with which the deposit account is maintained has “control”: the \nbank gets a security interest automatically because, as Official Comment 3 to UCC Section 9-104 puts it, \n“all actual and potential creditors of the debtor are always on notice that the bank with which the debtor’s \ndeposit account is maintained may assert a claim against the deposit account.” “Control” of electronic \nchattel paper of investment property, and of letter-of-credit rights is detailed in Sections 9-105, 9-106, \nand 9-107. Obtaining “control” means that the creditor has taken whatever steps are necessary, given the \nmanner in which the items are held, to place itself in a position where it can have the items sold, without \nfurther action by the owner. [42] \n \nAutomatic Perfection \nThe fifth mechanism of perfection is addressed in Section 9-309 of the UCC: there are several \ncircumstances where a security interest is perfected upon mere attachment. The most important here \nis automatic perfection of a purchase-money security interest given in consumer goods. If a seller of \nconsumer goods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection of the security interest is automatic. But \nthe seller may file a financial statement and faces a risk if he fails to file and the consumer debtor sells the \ngoods. Under Section 9-320(b), a buyer of consumer goods takes free of a security interest, even though \nperfected, if he buys without knowledge of the interest, pays value, and uses the goods for his personal, \nfamily, or household purposes—unless the secured party had first filed a financing statement covering the \ngoods. \n \nFigure 25.4 Attachment and Perfection \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1037 \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA creditor may be secured—allowed to take the debtor’s property upon debtor’s default—by agreement \nbetween the parties or by operation of law. The law governing agreements for personal property security is \nArticle 9 of the UCC. The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest. This is usually accomplished \nwhen the debtor, in return for value (a loan or credit) extended from the creditor, puts up as collateral some \nvaluable asset in which she has an interest and authenticates (signs) a security agreement (the contract) giving \nthe creditor a security interest in collateral and allowing that the creditor may take it if the debtor defaults. \nThe UCC lists various kinds of assets that can be collateralized, ranging from tangible property (goods), to \nassets only able to be manifested by paper (indispensable paper), to intangible assets (like patent rights). \nSometimes no security agreement is necessary, mostly if the creditor takes possession of the collateral. After \nattachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors \nclaim an interest in the collateral. Perfection is most often accomplished by filing a financing statement in the \nappropriate place to put the world on notice of the creditor’s interest. Perfection can also be achieved by a \npledge (possession by the secured creditor) or by “control” of certain assets (having such control over them as \nto be able to sell them if the debtor defaults). Perfection is automatic temporarily for some items (certified \nsecurities, instruments, and negotiable documents) but also upon mere attachment to purchase-money \nsecurity interests in consumer goods. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is a creditor ill-advised to be unsecured? \n2. Elaine bought a computer for her use as a high school teacher, the school contributing one-third of its cost. \nElaine was compelled to file for bankruptcy. The computer store claimed it had perfected its interest by \nmere attachment, and the bankruptcy trustee claimed the computer as an asset of Elaine’s bankruptcy \nestate. Who wins, and why?",

Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat. Who has priority? Whoever perfects first: \nthe rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet. Whoever can submit the financing \nstatement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not \ndepend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is claiming a security interest in the \nsame collateral. But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest \nfirst attached has priority? This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC \ncommentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation \nwithout [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, \nneither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee. \n \nTo rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors \nlose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected). If both parties are secured (have attached the \ninterest), the first to perfect wins. [1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins. [2] \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—\nactually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them. \n \nImmediate Exceptions \nWe call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate \npriority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it. They all involve purchase-money \nsecurity interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor \nhad sold the debtor. \n \n(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock). The UCC provides that \n“a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1042 \na conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase-money security interest is perfected \nwhen debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to \nthis UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an \nafter-acquired property clause.” \n \nSuppose Susan manufactures fur coats. On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI.

Then Rosemary would \nhave priority, because her filing was prior to Erika’s. \n \nWhat would happen if this kind of PMSI in noninventory goods (here, equipment) did not get priority \nstatus? A prudent Erika would not extend credit to Susan at all, and if the new machine is necessary for \nSusan’s business, she would soon be out of business. That certainly would not inure to the benefit of \nRosemary. It is, mostly, to Rosemary’s advantage that Susan gets the machine: it enhances Susan’s ability \nto make money to pay Rosemary. \n \n(2) Purchase-money security interest in inventory. The UCC provides that a perfected PMSI in inventory \nhas priority over conflicting interests in the same inventory, provided that the PMSI is perfected when the \ndebtor receives possession of the inventory, the PMSI-secured party sends an authenticated notification \nto the holder of the conflicting interest and that person receives the notice within five years before the \ndebtor receives possession of the inventory, and the notice states that the person sending it has or expects \nto acquire a PMSI in the inventory and describes the inventory. [4] The notice requirement is aimed at \nprotecting a secured party in the typical situation in which incoming inventory is subject to a prior \nagreement to make advances against it. If the original creditor gets notice that new inventory is subject to \na PMSI, he will be forewarned against making an advance on it; if he does not receive notice, he will have \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1043 \npriority. It is usually to the earlier creditor’s advantage that her debtor is able to get credit to “floor” \n(provide) inventory, without selling which, of course, the debtor cannot pay back the earlier creditor. \n \n(3) Purchase-money security interest in fixtures. Under UCC Section 9-334(e), a perfected security in \nfixtures has priority over a mortgage if the security interest is a PMSI and the security interest is perfected \nby a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days after. A mortgagee is usually a \nbank (the mortgagor is the owner of the real estate, subject to the mortgagee’s interest). The bank’s \nmortgage covers the real estate and fixtures, even fixtures added after the date of the mortgage (after-\nacquired property clause). In accord with the general rule, then, the mortgagee/bank would normally have \npriority if the mortgage is recorded first, as would a fixture filing if made before the mortgage was \nrecorded. But with the exception noted, the bank’s interest is subordinate to the fixture-seller’s later-\nperfected PMSI. Example: Susan buys a new furnace from Heating Co. to put in her house. Susan gave a \nbank a thirty-year mortgage on the house ten years before. Heating Co. takes back a PMSI and files the \nappropriate financing statement before or within twenty days of installation. If Susan defaults on her loan \nto the bank, Heating Co. would take priority over the bank. And why not? The mortgagee has, in the long \nrun, benefited from the improvement and modernization of the real estate. (Again, there are further \nnuances in Section 9-334 beyond our scope here.) A non-PMSI in fixtures or PMSIs perfected more than \ntwenty days after goods become a fixture loses out to prior recorded interests in the realty. \n \nOther Exceptions \nWe have noted the three immediate exceptions to the general rule that “the firstest with the mostest” \nprevails.

                    "answer": "The after-acquired property clause is a provision in a security agreement that grants the secured party a security interest in any property that the debtor acquires after the agreement is signed. This means that the secured party has a right to the property if the debtor defaults on the loan or other obligation that the agreement secures. The after-acquired property clause is often used to ensure that the secured party has a security interest in any new property that the debtor acquires, which can be valuable if the debtor defaults and the secured party needs to seize and sell the property to recover the debt. The after-acquired property clause is typically included in a security agreement, which is a contract between the debtor and the secured party that outlines the terms of the loan or other obligation and the security interest that the secured party has in the debtor's property."

                    "answer": "The PMSI rule, or the PMSI priority rule, is a legal principle that determines the priority of security interests in personal property. Under the PMSI rule, a purchase-money security interest (PMSI) in personal property has priority over a prior security interest in the same property, provided that the PMSI is perfected at the time the debtor receives possession of the property. The PMSI rule is designed to encourage the financing of the purchase of personal property, as it gives the lender a priority position in the event of default by the borrower. The PMSI rule applies to a wide range of personal property, including inventory, equipment, and fixtures. It is important to note that the PMSI rule is subject to certain exceptions and limitations, and it is important to understand the specific rules and requirements that apply in any given situation."

We will \nexamine some of the possible permutations but are compelled to observe that this area of law has many \nfine nuances, not all of which can be taken up here. \n \nFirst we look at buyers who take priority over, or free of, unperfected security interests. Buyers who take \ndelivery of many types of collateral covered by anunperfected security interest win out over the hapless \nsecured party who failed to perfect if they give value and don’t know of the security interest or agricultural \nlien. [5] A buyer who doesn’t give value or who knows of the security interest will not win out, nor will a \nbuyer prevail if the seller’s creditor files a financing statement before or within twenty days after the \ndebtor receives delivery of the collateral. \n \nNow we look at buyers who take priority over perfected security interests. Sometimes people who buy \nthings even covered by a perfected security interest win out (the perfected secured party loses). \n \n• \nBuyers in the ordinary course of business. “A buyer in the ordinary course of business, other than \n[one buying farm products from somebody engaged in farming] takes free of a security interest \ncreated by the buyer’s seller, even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows \n[it].” [6] Here the buyer is usually purchasing inventory collateral, and it’s OK if he knows the \ninventory is covered by a security interest, but it’s not OK if he knows “that the sale violates a term \nin an agreement with the secured party.” [7] It would not be conducive to faith in commercial \ntransactions if buyers of inventory generally had to worry whether their seller’s creditors were \ngoing to repossess the things the buyers had purchased in good faith. For example (based on \nexample 1 to the same comment, UCC 9-320, Official Comment 3), Manufacturer makes \nappliances and owns manufacturing equipment covered by a perfected security agreement in \nfavor of Lender. Manufacturer sells the equipment to Dealer, whose business is buying and selling \nused equipment; Dealer, in turn, sells the stuff to Buyer, a buyer in the ordinary course. Does \nBuyer take free of the security interest? No, because Dealer didn’t create it; Manufacturer did. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1045 \n• \nBuyers of consumer goods purchased for personal, family, or household use take free of security \ninterests, even if perfected, so long as they buy without knowledge of the security interest, for \nvalue, for their own consumer uses, and before the filing of a financing statement covering the \ngoods. This—again—is the rub when a seller of consumer goods perfects by “mere attachment” \n(automatic perfection) and the buyer of the goods turns around and sells them. For example, Tom \nbuys a new refrigerator from Sears, which perfects by mere attachment. Tom has cash flow \nproblems and sells the fridge to Ned, his neighbor. Ned doesn’t know about Sears’s security \ninterest and pays a reasonable amount for it. He puts it in his kitchen for home use. Sears cannot \nrepossess the fridge from Ned. If it wanted to protect itself fully, Sears would have filed a \nfinancing statement; then Ned would be out the fridge when the repo men came. [8] The “value” \nissue is interestingly presented in the Nicolosi case (Section 25.5 \"Cases\"). \n• \nBuyers of farm products. The UCC itself does not protect buyers of farm products from security \ninterests created by “the person engaged in farming operations who is in the business of selling \nfarm products,” and the result was that sometimes the buyer had to pay twice: once to the farmer \nand again to the lender whom the farmer didn’t pay. As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors",

Persons who become \nlien creditors after the security interest is perfected lose (subject to some nuances in situations where the \nlien arises between attachment by the creditor and the filing, and depending upon the type of security \ninterest and the type of collateral). [9] More straightforwardly, perhaps, a lien securing payment or \nperformance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1046 \nordinary course of business has priority over other security interests (unless a statute provides \notherwise). [10] This is the bailee or “material man” (one who supplies materials, as to build a house) with a \nlien situation. Garage Mechanic repairs a car in which Owner has previously given a perfected security \ninterest to Bank. Owner doesn’t pay Bank. Bank seeks to repossess the car from Mechanic. It will have to \npay the Mechanic first. And why not? If the car was not running, Bank would have to have it repaired \nanyway. \n \nBankruptcy Trustee \nTo what extent can the bankruptcy trustee take property previously encumbered by a security interest? It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does. The rationale: “this…enables banks to extend credit to their depositors without the need to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1047 \nexamine [records] to determine whether another party might have a security interest in the deposit \naccount.” [14] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nWho among competing creditors gets the collateral if the debtor defaults? The general rule on priorities is \nthat the first to secure most completely wins: if all competitors have perfected, the first to do so wins. If one \nhas perfected and the others have not, the one who perfects wins. If all have attached, the first to attach wins. \nIf none have attached, they’re all unsecured creditors. To this general rule there are a number of exceptions. \nPurchase-money security interests in goods and inventory prevail over previously perfected secured parties in \nthe same goods and inventory (subject to some requirements); fixture financers who file properly have \npriority over previously perfected mortgagees. Buyers in the ordinary course of business take free of a security \ninterest created by their seller, so long as they don’t know their purchase violates a security agreement.",

Douglas Asphalt Co. \n338 Fed.Appx. 886, 11th Cir. Ct. (2009) \n \nPer Curium: [1] \nThe Georgia Department of Transportation (“GDOT”) contracted with Douglas Asphalt Company to \nperform work on an interstate highway. After Douglas Asphalt allegedly failed to pay its suppliers and \nsubcontractors and failed to perform under the contract, GDOT defaulted and terminated Douglas \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1072 \nAsphalt. Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland and Zurich American Insurance Company had \nexecuted payment and performance bonds in connection with Douglas Asphalt’s work on the interstate, \nand after Douglas Asphalt’s default, Fidelity and Zurich spent $15,424,798 remedying the default. \n \nFidelity and Zurich, seeking to recover their losses related to their remedy of the default, brought this suit \nagainst Douglas Asphalt, Joel Spivey, and Ronnie Spivey. The Spiveys and Douglas Asphalt had executed \na General Indemnity Agreement in favor of Fidelity and Zurich. [2] \nAfter a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Fidelity and Zurich for $16,524,798. \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys now appeal. \n \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in entering judgment in favor of \nFidelity and Zurich because Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith in three ways. \n \nFirst, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in not finding that Fidelity and \nZurich acted in bad faith because they claimed excessive costs to remedy the default. Specifically, Douglas \nAsphalt and the Spiveys argue that they introduced evidence that the interstate project was 98% complete, \nand that only approximately $3.6 million was needed to remedy any default. But, the district court found \nthat the interstate project was only 90%–92% complete and that approximately $2 million needed to be \nspent to correct defective work already done by Douglas Asphalt. Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys have \nnot shown that the district court’s finding was clearly erroneous, and accordingly, their argument that \nFidelity and Zurich showed bad faith in claiming that the project was only 90% complete and therefore \nrequired over $15 million to remedy the default fails. \n \nSecond, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith by failing to \ncontest the default. However, the district court concluded that the indemnity agreement required Douglas \nAsphalt and the Spiveys to request a contest of the default, and to post collateral security to pay any \njudgment rendered in the course of contesting the default. The court’s finding that Douglas Asphalt and \nthe Spiveys made no such request and posted no collateral security was not clearly erroneous, and the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1073 \nsureties had no independent duty to investigate a default. Accordingly, Fidelity and Zurich’s failure to \ncontest the default does not show bad faith. \n \nFinally, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich’s refusal to permit them to remain \ninvolved with the interstate project, either as a contractor or consultant, was evidence of bad faith. Yet, \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys did not direct the district court or this court to any case law that holds \nthat the refusal to permit a defaulting contractor to continue working on a project is bad faith. As the \ndistrict court concluded, Fidelity and Zurich had a contractual right to take possession of all the work \nunder the contract and arrange for its completion. Fidelity and Zurich exercised that contractual right, \nand, as the district court noted, the exercise of a contractual right is not evidence of bad faith. \n \nFinding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why were Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys supposed to pay the sureties nearly $15.5 million? \n2. What did the plaintiffs claim the defendant sureties did wrong as relates to how much money they spent to \ncure the default? \n3. What is a “contest of the default”? \n4.

A sample mortgage \nform is presented in Figure 26.2 \"Sample Mortgage Form\". \n \nFigure 26.2 Sample Mortgage Form \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAs a mechanism of security, a mortgage is a promise by the debtor (mortgagor) to repay the creditor \n(mortgagee) for the amount borrowed or credit extended, with real estate put up as security. If the mortgagor \ndoesn’t pay as promised, the mortgagee may repossess the real estate. Mortgage law has ancient roots and \nbrings with it various permutations on the theme that even if the mortgagor defaults, she may nevertheless \nhave the right to get the property back or at least be reimbursed for any value above that necessary to pay \nthe debt and the expenses of foreclosure. Mortgage law is regulated by state and federal statute. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1086 \n \n1.

Understand why it is important that the mortgagee (creditor) record her interest in the debtor’s real estate. \n2. Know the basic rule of priority—who gets an interest in the property first in case of default—and the \nexceptions to the rule. \n3. Recognize the three ways mortgages can be terminated: payment, assumption, and foreclosure. \n4. Be familiar with other methods (besides mortgages) by which real property can be used as security for a \ncreditor. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1087 \nPriorities in Real Property Security \nYou may recall from Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" how important it is for a creditor \nto perfect its secured interest in the goods put up as collateral. Absent perfection, the creditor stands a \nchance of losing out to another creditor who took its interest in the goods subsequent to the first creditor. \nThe same problem is presented in real property security: the mortgagee wants to make sure it has first \nclaim on the property in case the mortgagor (debtor) defaults. \n \nThe General Rule of Priorities \nThe general rule of priority is the same for real property security as for personal property security: the \nfirst in time to give notice of the secured interest is first in right. For real property, the notice is \nby recording the mortgage. Recording is the act of giving public notice of changes in interests in real \nestate. Recording was created by statute; it did not exist at common law. The typical recording statute \ncalls for a transfer of title or mortgage to be placed in a particular county office, usually the auditor, \nrecorder, or register of deeds. \nA mortgage is valid between the parties whether or not it is recorded, but a mortgagee might lose to a \nthird party—another mortgagee or a good-faith purchaser of the property—unless the mortgage is \nrecorded. \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are exceptions to the general rule; two are taken up here. \n \nFixture Filing \nThe fixture-filing provision in Article 9 of the UCC is one exception to the general rule. As noted \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\", the UCC gives priority to purchase-money security \ninterests in fixtures if certain requirements are met. \n \nFuture Advances \nA bank might make advances to the debtor after accepting the mortgage. If the future advances are \nobligatory, then the first-in-time rule applies. For example: Bank accepts Debtor’s mortgage (and records \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1088 \nit) and extends a line of credit on which Debtor draws, up to a certain limit. (Or, as in the construction \nindustry, Bank might make periodic advances to the contractors as work progresses, backed by the \nmortgage.) Second Creditor loans Debtor money—secured by the same property—before Debtor began to \ndraw against the first line of credit. Bank has priority: by searching the mortgage records, Second Creditor",

                    "answer": "The right of redemption allows the mortgagor to redeem the property by paying the debt in full plus interest, costs, and expenses of foreclosure. The right of redemption was established by courts of equity to protect mortgagors from losing their property to foreclosure. Prior to the establishment of the right of redemption, a mortgage was considered a transfer of title to the mortgagee, meaning that the mortgagor would lose the property to foreclosure if they were unable to pay the debt. The right of redemption allowed the mortgagor to redeem the property by paying the debt in full plus interest, costs, and expenses of foreclosure, which prevented the mortgagee from gaining full ownership of the property. This change in the substance of the mortgage from a transfer of title to a mere lien on the property was made by courts of equity to protect the rights of mortgagors."

Some of the specific abuses addressed by RESPA include kickbacks and referral fees between mortgage lenders and real estate agents, excessive fees charged by mortgage lenders, and unfair practices in the settlement process. RESPA also requires mortgage lenders to provide borrowers with certain disclosures, such as the Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and the Truth in Lending (TIL) disclosure, which are designed to help borrowers understand the terms and costs of their mortgage loans. Overall, RESPA was designed to protect borrowers from unfair and deceptive practices in the mortgage lending industry and to ensure that they have access to accurate and transparent information about their mortgage loans."

                    "answer": "The two documents most commonly associated with mortgage transactions are the mortgage note and the mortgage deed. The mortgage note is a legal contract between the borrower and the lender that outlines the terms and conditions of the loan, including the amount borrowed, the interest rate, and the repayment schedule. The mortgage deed, also known as a mortgage, is a legal document that gives the lender a security interest in the property as collateral for the loan. In other words, if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can foreclose on the property and sell it to recover the outstanding balance of the loan. Both documents are essential components of a mortgage transaction and are required for the loan to be legally binding."

FL 2002) \n \nBackground \n \n[Paul Cherry filed a complaint suing Chase for Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violations and slander of \ncredit.]…Chase counter-claimed for foreclosure and reestablishment of the lost note.… \n \n…Chase held a mortgage on Cherry’s home to which Cherry made timely payments until August 2000. \nCherry stopped making payments on the mortgage after he received a letter from Chase acknowledging \nhis satisfaction of the mortgage. Cherry notified Chase of the error through a customer service \nrepresentative. Cherry, however, received a check dated August 15, 2000, as an escrow refund on the \nmortgage. Chase subsequently recorded a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the Pinellas County public records \non October 19, 2000. On November 14, 2000, Chase sent Cherry a “Loan Reactivation” letter with a new \nloan number upon which to make the payments. During this time, Cherry was placing his mortgage \npayments into a bank account, which subsequently were put into an escrow account maintained by his \nattorney. These payments were not, and have not, been tendered to Chase. As a result of the failure to \ntender, Chase sent Cherry an acceleration warning on November 17, 2000, and again on March 16, 2001. \nChase notified the credit bureaus as to Cherry’s default status and moved for foreclosure. In a letter \naddressed to Cherry’s attorney, dated April 24, 2001, Chase’s attorney advised Cherry to make the \nmortgage payments to Chase. Chase recorded a “vacatur, revocation, and cancellation of satisfaction of \nmortgage” (vacatur) [vacatur: an announcement filed in court that something is cancelled or set aside; an \nannulment] in the Pinellas County public records on May 3, 2001. Chase signed the vacatur on March 21, \n2001, and had it notarized on March 27, 2001. Chase has also been unable to locate the original note, \ndated October 15, 1997, and deems it to be lost.… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1100 \n \nForeclosure \n \nChase accelerated Cherry’s mortgage debt after determining he was in a default status under the mortgage \nprovisions. Chase claims that the right to foreclose under the note and mortgage is “absolute,” [Citation], \nand that this Court should enforce the security interest in the mortgage though Chase made an \nadministrative error in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the public records.… \n \nMortgage \n \n…Chase relies on the Florida Supreme Court decision in United Service Corp. v. Vi-An Const. Corp., \n[Citation] (Fla.1955), which held that a Satisfaction of Mortgage “made through a mistake may be \ncanceled” and a mortgage reestablished as long as no other innocent third parties have “acquired an \ninterest in the property.” Generally the court looks to the rights of any innocent third parties, and if none \nexist, equity will grant relief to a mortgagee who has mistakenly satisfied a mortgage before fully paid. \n[Citation]. Both parties agree that the mortgage was released before the debt was fully paid. Neither party \nhas presented any facts to this Court that implies the possibility nor existence of a third party interest. \nAlthough Cherry argues under Biggs v. Smith, 184 So. 106, 107 (1938), that a recorded satisfaction of \nmortgage is “prima facie evidence of extinguishment of a mortgage lien,” Biggs does not apply this \nstandard to mortgage rights affected by a mistake in the satisfaction. \n \nTherefore, on these facts, this Court acknowledges that a vacatur is a proper remedy for Chase to correct \nits unilateral mistake since “equity will grant relief to those who have through mistake released a \nmortgage.” [Citation.] Accordingly, this Court holds that an equity action is required to make a vacatur \nenforceable unless the parties consent to the vacatur or a similar remedy during the mortgage \nnegotiation.… \n \nTender \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1101 \nCherry has not made a mortgage payment to Chase since August 2000, but claims to have made these \npayments into an escrow account, which he claims were paid to the escrow account because Chase \nrecorded a satisfaction of his mortgage and, therefore, no mortgage existed. Cherry also claims that \nrepresentatives of Chase rejected his initial attempts to make payments because of a lack of a valid loan \nnumber. Chase, however, correctly argues that payments made to an escrow account are not a proper \ntender of payment.Matthews v. Lindsay, [Citation] (1884) (requiring tender to be made to the court). Nor \ndid Cherry make the required mortgage payments to the court as provided by [relevant court rules], \nallowing for a “deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether that party claims all or \nany part of the sum or thing.” Further, Chase also correctly argues that Cherry’s failure to tender the \npayments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court is more than just a “technical breach” \nof the mortgage and note.

[Citation.] Although not presented by \nChase in its discussion of this case, the Court may refuse foreclosure, notwithstanding that the defendant \nestablished a foreclosure action, if the acceleration was unconscionable and the “result would be \ninequitable and unjust.” This Court will analyze the inequitable result test and the limited circumstances \nby which the court may deny foreclosure. \n \nFirst, this Court does not find the mortgage acceleration unconscionable by assuming arguendo [for the \npurposes of argument] that the mortgage was valid during the period that the Satisfaction of Mortgage \nwas entered into the public records. Chase did not send the first acceleration warning until November 14, \n2000, the fourth month of non-payment, followed by the second acceleration letter on March 16, 2001, \nthe eighth month of non-payment. Although Cherry could have argued that a foreclosure action was an \n“inequitable” and “unjust” result after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered on his behalf, the result \ndoes not rise to an unconscionable level since Cherry could have properly tendered the mortgage \npayments to the court. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1102 \nSecond, the following “limited circumstances” will justify a court’s denial of foreclosure: 1) waiver of right \nto accelerate; 2) mortgagee estopped from asserting foreclosure because mortgagor reasonably assumed \nthe mortgagee would not foreclose; 3) mortgagee failed to perform a condition precedent for acceleration; \n4) payment made after default but prior to receiving intent to foreclose; or, 5) where there was intent to \nmake to make timely payment, and it was attempted, or steps taken to accomplish it, but nevertheless the \npayment was not made due to a misunderstanding or excusable neglect, coupled with some conduct of the \nmortgagee which in a measure contributed to the failure to pay when due or within the grace period. \n[Citations.] \n \nChase fails to address this fifth circumstance in its motion, an apparent obfuscation of the case law before \nthe court. This Court acknowledges that Cherry’s facts do not satisfy the first four limited circumstances. \nChase at no time advised Cherry that the acceleration right was being waived; nor is Chase estopped from \nasserting foreclosure on the mortgage because of the administrative error, and Cherry has not relied on \nthis error to his detriment; and since Chase sent the acceleration letter to Cherry and a request for \npayment to his attorney, there can be no argument that Cherry believed Chase would not foreclose. Chase \nhas performed all conditions precedent required by the mortgage provisions prior to notice of the \nacceleration; sending acceleration warnings on November 17, 2000, and March 16, 2001. Cherry also has \nno argument for lack of notice of intent to accelerate after default since he has not tendered a payment \nsince July 2000, thus placing him in default of the mortgage provisions, and he admits receiving the \nacceleration notices. \n \nThis Court finds, however, that this claim fails squarely into the final limited circumstance regarding \nintent to make timely payments.

Cherry claims that he attempted to make the \npayments, but was told by a representative of Chase that there was no mortgage loan number upon which \nto apply the payments. As a result, the mortgage payments were placed into an account and later into his \ncounsel’s trust account as a mortgage escrow.

In addition, the landlord/owner may be located far away and may own many properties, making \nit impractical for him to have direct involvement with the materialman.

What Kind of Consent Is Necessary. \nThis Court has already clearly held the consent required by [the relevant section] is “something more than \na mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence. It implies an agreement to that which, but for \nthe consent, could not exist, and which the party consenting has a right to forbid.” [Citations.] However, \nour Mechanics Lien Statute has never been applied in the landlord-tenant context where a third party is \ninvolved. \n \nOther jurisdictions have addressed this issue. The Court of Appeals cited [a Connecticut case, 1987] in \nsupport of its holding. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Connecticut court’s reasoning is \npersuasive, especially since Connecticut has a similar mechanics lien statute.… \n \nThe Connecticut courts have stated “the consent required from the owner or one acting under the owner’s \nauthority is more than the mere granting of permission for work to be conducted on one’s property; or the \nmere knowledge that work was being performed on one’s land.” Furthermore, although the Connecticut \ncourts have stated the statute does not require an express contract, the courts have required “consent that \nindicates an agreement that the owner of…the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor.”… \n \nThe reasoning of [Connecticut and other states that have decided this issue] is persuasive. F & D’s brief \nappears to argue that mere knowledge by the landowner that the work needed to be done, coupled with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1108 \nthe landlord’s general “permission” to perform the work, is enough to establish consent under the statute. \nUnder this interpretation, a landlord who knew a tenant needed to improve, upgrade, or add to the leased \npremises would be liable to any contractor and/or subcontractor who performed work on his land. Under \nF & D’s interpretation the landlord would not be required to know the scope, cost, etc. of the work, but \nwould only need to give the tenant general permission to perform upgrades or improvements. \n \nClearly, if the landlord/owner or his agent gives consent directly to the materialman, a lien can be \nestablished. Consent can also be given to the tenant, but the consent needs to be specific. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent must know the scope of the project (for instance, as the lease provided in the \ninstant case, the landlord could approve written plans submitted by the tenant). The consent needs to be \nmore than “mere knowledge” that the tenant will perform work on the property. There must be some kind \nof express or implied agreement that the landlord may be held liable for the work or material. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent may delegate the project or work to his tenant, but there must be an express \nor implied agreement about the specific work to be done.

To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent. Additionally, Currin’s statement to [an interested person who \nmight bid on the property] that a full credit sale price was expected and that the opening bid would be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1115 \n$4.1 million did not constitute intentional chilling. SFI was owed $4.1 million on the Property. SFI could \nthus bid up to that amount at no cost to itself, as the proceeds would go back to SFI. Currin confirmed that \nSFI was prepared to make a full-credit bid. [It is common for trustees to] disclose the full-credit bid \namount to potential third party bidders, and for investors to lose interest when they learn of the amount \nof indebtedness on property. It was therefore not a misrepresentation for Currin to state $4.1 million as \nthe opening bid, due to the indebtedness on the Property. Currin’s statements had no chilling effect—they \nmerely informed [interested persons] of the minimum amount necessary to prevail against SFI. Thus, \nCurrin did not intentionally chill the bidding by giving Street that information. \n \nAlpha also argues that the chilled bidding could have been unintended by Currin.… [But the evidence is \nthat] Currin’s actions did not intentionally or unintentionally chill the bidding, and the sale will not be set \naside. \n \nAdequacy of the Sale Price \nAlpha claims that the sale price was ‘greatly inadequate’ and that the sale should thus be set aside. Alpha \nsubmitted evidence that the property had an ‘as is’ value of $4.35 million in December 2002, and an \nestimated 2004 value of $5.2 million. The debt owed to SFI on the property was $4.1 million. SFI bought \nthe property for $2.1 million. These facts do not suggest that the sale must be set aside. \n \nWashington case law suggests that the price the property is sold for must be ‘grossly inadequate’ for a \ntrustee’s sale to be set aside on those grounds alone. In Cox [Citation, 1985], the property was worth \nbetween $200,000 and $300,000, and was sold to the beneficiary for $11,873. The Court held that \namount to be grossly inadequate In Steward [Citation, 1988] the property had been purchased for \napproximately $64,000, and then was sold to a third party at a foreclosure sale for $4,870. This court \nheld that $4,870 was not grossly inadequate. In Miebach [Citation] (1984), the Court noted that a sale for \nless than two percent of the property’s fair market value was grossly inadequate. The Court \nin Miebach also noted prior cases where the sale had been voided due to grossly inadequate purchase \nprice; the properties in those cases had been sold for less than four percent of the value and less than \nthree percent of the value. In addition, the Restatement indicates that gross inadequacy only exists when \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1116 \nthe sale price is less than 20 percent of the fair market value—without other defects, sale prices over 20 \npercent will not be set aside. [Citation.] The Property was sold for between 40 and 48 percent of its value. \nThese facts do not support a grossly inadequate purchase price. \n \nAlpha cites Miebach for the proposition that ‘where the inadequacy of price is great the sale will be set \naside with slight indications of fraud or unfairness,’ arguing that such indications existed here. However, \nthe cases cited by the Court in Miebach to support this proposition involved properties sold for less than \nthree and four percent of their value. Alpha has not demonstrated the slightest indication of fraud, nor \nshown that a property that sold for 40 to 48 percent of its value sold for a greatly inadequate price. \n \nDuty to a Junior Lienholder \nAlpha claims that Currin owed a duty to Alpha, the junior lienholder. Alpha cites no case law for this \nproposition, and, indeed, there is none—Division Two specifically declined to decide this issue in Country \nExpress [Citation]. Alpha acknowledges the lack of language in RCW 61.24 (the deed of trust statute) \nregarding fiduciary duties of trustees to junior lienholders. But Alpha argues that since RCW 61.24 \nrequires that the trustee follow certain procedures in conducting the sale, and allows for sales to be \nrestrained by anyone with an interest, a substantive duty from the trustee to a junior lienholder can be \ninferred. \n \nAlpha’s arguments are unavailing.

The 2005 act—preceded by “massive lobbying largely by banks and credit card companies” [1]—\nwas intended by its promoters to restore personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system. \nThe law’s critics said it was simply a way for the credit card industry to extract more money from \nconsumers before their debts were wiped away. \n \nFigure 27.1 US Bankruptcies, 1980–2009 \n \nBankruptcy Action.com,http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/USbankstats.htm, statistics from \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. \n \nBankruptcy Courts, Judges, and Costs \nEach federal judicial district has a US Bankruptcy Court, whose judges are appointed by US Courts of \nAppeal. Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases. Chapter 5, “Creditors, the \nDebtor, and the Estate,” deals with the debtor’s “estate”—his or her assets. It lays down ground rules for",

But involuntary bankruptcy is possible, too, \nunder Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. To put anyone into bankruptcy involuntarily, the petitioning creditors \nmust meet three conditions: (1) they must have claims for unsecured debt amounting to at least $13,475; \n(2) three creditors must join in the petition whenever twelve or more creditors have claims against the \nparticular debtor—otherwise, one creditor may file an involuntary petition, as long as his claim is for at \nleast $13,475; (3) there must be no bona fide dispute about the debt owing. If there is a dispute, the debtor \ncan resist the involuntary filing, and if she wins the dispute, the creditors who pushed for the involuntary \npetition have to pay the associated costs. Persons owing less than $13,475, farmers, and charitable \norganizations cannot be forced into bankruptcy. \n \nThe Automatic Stay \nThe petition—voluntary or otherwise—operates as a stay against suits or other actions against the debtor \nto recover claims, enforce judgments, or create liens (but not alimony collection). In other words, once the \npetition is filed, the debtor is freed from worry over other proceedings affecting her finances or property. \nNo more debt collection calls! Anyone with a claim, secured or unsecured, must seek relief in the \nbankruptcy court. This provision in the act can have dramatic consequences. Beset by tens of thousands of \nproducts-liability suits for damages caused by asbestos, UNR Industries and Manville Corporation, the \nnation’s largest asbestos producers, filed (separate) voluntary bankruptcy petitions in 1982; those filings \nautomatically stayed all pending lawsuits. \n \nFirst Meeting of Creditors \nOnce a petition in bankruptcy is filed, the court issues an order of relief, which determines that the \ndebtor’s property is subject to bankruptcy court control and creates the stay. The Chapter 7 case may be \ndismissed by the court if, after a notice and hearing, it finds that among other things (e.g., delay, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1130 \nnonpayment of required bankruptcy fees), the debts are primarily consumer debts and the debtor could \npay them off—that’s the 2005 act’s famous “means test,” discussed in Section 27.3 \"Chapter 7 \nLiquidation\". \n \nAssuming that the order of relief has been properly issued, the creditors must meet within a reasonable \ntime. The debtor is obligated to appear at the meeting and submit to examination under oath. The judge \ndoes not preside and, indeed, is not even entitled to attend the meeting. \n \nWhen the judge issues an order for relief, an interim trustee is appointed who is authorized initially to \ntake control of the debtor’s assets. The trustee is required to collect the property, liquidate the debtor’s \nestate, and distribute the proceeds to the creditors. The trustee may sue and be sued in the name of the \nestate. Under every chapter except Chapter 7, the court has sole discretion to name the trustee. Under \nChapter 7, the creditors may select their own trustee as long as they do it at the first meeting of creditors \nand follow the procedures laid down in the act. \nTrustee’s Powers and Duties \nThe act empowers the trustee to use, sell, or lease the debtor’s property in the ordinary course of business \nor, after notice and a hearing, even if not in the ordinary course of business. In all cases, the trustee must \nprotect any security interests in the property. As long as the court has authorized the debtor’s business to \ncontinue, the trustee may also obtain credit in the ordinary course of business. She may invest money in \nthe estate to yield the maximum, but reasonably safe, return. Subject to the court’s approval, she may \nemploy various professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and appraisers, and may, with some \nexceptions, assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases that the debtor has made. The \ntrustee also has the power to avoid many prebankruptcy transactions in order to recover property of the \ndebtor to be included in the liquidation. \n \nCreditors’ Claims, the Debtor, and the Estate (Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nWe now turn to the major matters covered in Chapter 5 of the bankruptcy act: creditors’ claims, debtors’ \nexemptions and discharge, and the property to be included in the estate. We begin with the rules \ngoverning proof of claims by creditors and the priority of their claims. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1131 \n \nClaims and Creditors \nA claim is defined as a right to payment, whether or not it is reduced to judgment, liquidated, \nunliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or",

            "chunk": "One such power (in Section 544) is to act as a hypothetical lien creditor. This power is best explained \nby an example. Suppose Dennis Debtor purchases equipment on credit from Acme Supply Company. \nAcme fails to perfect its security interest, and a few weeks later Debtor files a bankruptcy petition. By \nvirtue of the section conferring on the trustee the status of a hypothetical lien creditor, the trustee can act \nas though she had a lien on the equipment, with priority over Acme’s unperfected security interest. Thus \nthe trustee can avoid Acme’s security interest, with the result that Acme would be treated as an unsecured \ncreditor. \n \nAnother power is to avoid transactions known as voidable preferences—transactions highly favorable \nto particular creditors. [5] A transfer of property is voidable if it was made (1) to a creditor or for his \nbenefit, (2) on account of a debt owed before the transfer was made, (3) while the debtor was insolvent, \n(4) on or within ninety days before the filing of the petition, and (5) to enable a creditor to receive more \nthan he would have under Chapter 7. If the creditor was an “insider”—one who had a special relationship \nwith the debtor, such as a relative or general partner of the debtor or a corporation that the debtor \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1140 \ncontrols or serves in as director or officer—then the trustee may void the transaction if it was made within \none year of the filing of the petition, assuming that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transaction \nwas made. \n \nSome prebankruptcy transfers that seem to fall within these provisions do not. The most important \nexceptions are (1) transfers made for new value (the debtor buys a refrigerator for cash one week before \nfiling a petition; this is an exchange for new value and the trustee may not void it); (2) a transfer that \ncreates a purchase-money security interest securing new value if the secured party perfects within ten \ndays after the debtor receives the goods; (3) payment of a debt incurred in the ordinary course of \nbusiness, on ordinary business terms; (4) transfers totaling less than $600 by an individual whose debts \nare primarily consumer debts; (5) transfers totaling less than $5,475 by a debtor whose debts are not \nprimarily consumer debts; and (6) transfers to the extent the transfer was a bona fide domestic support \nobligation. \n \nA third power of the trustee is to avoid fraudulent transfers made within two years before the date that \nthe bankruptcy petition was filed. [6] This provision contemplates various types of fraud. For example, \nwhile insolvent, the debtor might transfer property to a relative for less than it was worth, intending to \nrecover it after discharge. This situation should be distinguished from the voidable preference just \ndiscussed, in which the debtor pays a favored creditor what he actually owes but in so doing cannot then \npay other creditors. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA bankruptcy commences with the filing of a petition of bankruptcy. Creditors file proofs of claim and are \nentitled to certain priorities: domestic support obligations and the costs of administration are first. The debtor \nhas an obligation to file full and truthful schedules and to attend a credit counseling session, if applicable. The \ndebtor has a right to claim exemptions, federal or state, that leave her with assets sufficient to make a fresh \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1141 \nstart: some home equity, an automobile, and clothing and personal effects, among others. The honest debtor \nis discharged of many debts, but some are nondischargeable, among them taxes, debt from illegal behavior \n(embezzlement, drunk driving), fines, student loans, and certain consumer debt. A debtor may, after proper \ncounseling, reaffirm debt, but only before filing. The bankruptcy trustee takes over the nonexempt property \nof the debtor; he may act as a hypothetical lien creditor (avoiding unperfected security interests) and avoid \npreferential and fraudulent transfers that unfairly diminish the property of the estate. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What is the automatic stay, and when does it arise? \n2. Why are the expenses of claimants administering the bankruptcy given top priority (notwithstanding the \nnominal top priority of domestic support obligations)? \n3.

The stay goes into effect as soon as a bankruptcy petition is filed and remains in effect until the case is closed or dismissed. The purpose of the automatic stay is to give the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors. It stops all collection efforts, all harassment, and all foreclosure actions. The automatic stay provides a bit of stability in an otherwise chaotic situation. The automatic stay does not, however, stop all actions; it only stops actions that may harm the debtor or the debtor's estate.

Here is one practitioner’s explanation of the means test: \nTo apply the means test, the courts will look at the debtor’s average income for the 6 months prior \nto filing [not the debtor’s income at the time of filing, when—say—she just lost her job] and \ncompare it to the median income for that state. For example, the median annual income for a \nsingle wage-earner in California is $42,012. If the income is below the median, then Chapter 7 \nremains open as an option. If the income exceeds the median, the remaining parts of the means \ntest will be applied. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1144 \n \nThe next step in the calculation takes monthly income less reasonable living expenses \n[“reasonable living expenses” are strictly calculated based on IRS standards; the figure excludes \npayments on the debts included in the bankruptcy], and multiplies that figure times 60. This \nrepresents the amount of income available over a 5-year period for repayment of the debt \nobligations. \n \nIf the income available for debt repayment over that 5-year period is $10,000 or more, then \nChapter 13 will be required. In other words, anyone earning above the state median, and with at \nleast $166.67 per month ($10,000 divided by 60) of available income, will automatically be \ndenied Chapter 7. So for example, if the court determines that you have $200 per month income \nabove living expenses, $200 times 60 is $12,000. Since $12,000 is above $10,000, you’re stuck \nwith Chapter 13. \n \nWhat happens if you are above the median income but do NOT have at least $166.67 per month to \npay toward your debts? Then the final part of the means test is applied. If the available income is \nless than $100 per month, then Chapter 7 again becomes an option. If the available income is \nbetween $100 and $166.66, then it is measured against the debt as a percentage, with 25% being \nthe benchmark. \n \nIn other words, let’s say your income is above the median, your debt is $50,000, and you only \nhave $125 of available monthly income. We take $125 times 60 months (5 years), which equals \n$7,500 total. Since $7,500 is less than 25% of your $50,000 debt, Chapter 7 is still a possible \noption for you. If your debt was only $25,000, then your $7,500 of available income would \nexceed 25% of your debt and you would be required to file under Chapter 13. \n \nTo sum up, first figure out whether you are above or below the median income for your state—\nmedian income figures are available athttp://www.new-bankruptcy-law-info.com. Be sure to \naccount for your spouse’s income if you are a two-income family. Next, deduct your average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1145 \nmonthly living expenses from your monthly income and multiply by 60. If the result is above \n$10,000, you’re stuck with Chapter 13. If the result is below $6,000, you may still be able to file \nChapter 7. If the result is between $6,000 and $10,000, compare it to 25% of your debt. Above \n25%, you’re looking at Chapter 13 for sure. [1] \n \nThe law also requires that attorneys sign the petition (as well as the debtor); the attorney’s signature \ncertifies that the petition is well-grounded in fact and that the attorney has no knowledge after reasonable \ninquiry that the schedules and calculations are incorrect.

If the available income is less than $100 per month, then Chapter 7 again becomes an option. If the available income is between $100 and $166.66, then it is measured against the debt as a percentage, with 25% being the benchmark. In other words, let’s say your income is above the median, your debt is $50,000, and you only have $125 of available monthly income. We take $125 times 60 months (5 years), which equals $7,500 total. Since $7,500 is less than 25% of your $50,000 debt, Chapter 7 is still a possible option for you. If your debt was only $25,000, then your $7,500 of available income would exceed 25% of your debt and you would be required to file under Chapter 13.

See [Citation.] \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has adopted a three-part test to guide courts in their attempts to determine whether a \ndebtor will suffer an undue hardship is required to repay a student loan: \n \n• \nFirst, the debtor must establish “that she cannot maintain, based on current income and \nexpenses, a ‘minimal’ standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the \nloans.”… \n• \nSecond, the debtor must show “that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of \naffairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.”… \n• \nThe third prong requires “that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.…” \n \n(Pena, citing Brunner v. N.Y. State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., [Citation]). \n \nDebtor must satisfy all three parts of the Brunner test before her student loans can be discharged. Failure \nto prove any of the three prongs will defeat a debtor’s case. \n \nWhen this bankruptcy case was filed in September 2005, the debtor was a single woman and had no \ndependents. She is 39 years old. \n \nSchedule I reported that the debtor was unemployed. The debtor’s responses to the Statement of Financial \nAffairs revealed that she had received $5,500 in income during 2005 prior to the filing of the petition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1160 \nEvidence at trial indicated that after the petition was filed, the debtor found work and earned a total of \n$9,424 in 2005. In 2004 and 2003, she earned $13,994 and $17,339, respectively. \nDespite this modest income, the debtor did not immediately file an adversary proceeding to determine the \ndischargeability of her student loans. It was almost three years after the entry of her chapter 7 discharge \n‘on January 3, 2006 that the debtor reopened her chapter 7 case in order to pursue this adversary \nproceeding.’ \n \nIn her complaint, the debtor admits that after she received a discharge, she found part-time work with a \nchurch and later took a full-time job as a speech therapist. During 2006, the debtor earned $20,009 and \nin 2007 she earned $37,314. Hence, while it is clear the debtor’s income was very modest in the time \nperiod immediately prior to her bankruptcy petition, her financial situation improved during her \nbankruptcy case. \n \nThe court cannot conclude based on the evidence of the debtor’s financial circumstances up to the date of \nthe discharge, that she was unable to maintain a minimal standard of living if she was required to repay \nher students [sic] loans. \n \nHowever, in January 2007, the debtor was injured in an automobile accident. Her injuries eventually \nhalted the financial progress she had been making and eventually prevented her from working. She now \nsubsists on social security disability payments. \n \nThe circumstance creating the debtor’s hardship, the automobile accident, occurred after her chapter 7 \npetition was filed, indeed, approximately one year after her discharge was entered. The debtor is \nmaintaining that this post-petition, post-discharge circumstance warrants a declaration that her student \nloans were discharged effective from the petition date. \n \nWhen must the circumstances creating a debtor’s hardship arise: before the bankruptcy case is filed; after \nthe case if filed but prior to the entry of a discharge; or at anytime, including after the entry of a \ndischarge? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1161 \n \nThe court concludes that the circumstances causing a chapter 7 debtor’s financial hardship must arise \nprior to the entry of the discharge. If the circumstances causing a debtor’s hardship arise after the entry of \na discharge, those circumstances cannot form the basis of a determination that repayment of a student \nloan will be an undue hardship.… \n \n[T]here is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code requiring that a complaint under section 523(a)(8) [to \ndischarge student loans] be filed at any particular point in a bankruptcy case, whether it is filed under \nchapter 7 or 13.

BAP, (Idaho, 2008) \n \nOn July 13, 1995, Ryan was convicted of possession of an unregistered firearm under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) \nin the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. Ryan was sentenced to fifty-seven months in \nprison followed by three years of supervised release. In addition, Ryan was ordered to pay a fine of \n$7,500…, costs of prosecution in the amount of $83,420, and a special assessment of $50.00. Ryan served \nhis sentence. He also paid the $7,500 fine. The district court, following an appellate mandate, ultimately \neliminated the restitution obligation. \n \nOn April 25, 2003, Ryan filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under chapter 7 in the District of Idaho. He \nreceived his chapter 7 discharge on August 11, 2003. Shortly thereafter, Ryan filed a case under chapter \n13, listing as his only obligation the amount of unpaid costs of prosecution owed to the United States \n(“Government”).… \n \nRyan completed payments under the plan, and an “Order of Discharge” was entered on October 5, 2006. \nThe chapter 13 trustee’s final report reflected that the Government received $2,774.89 from payments \nmade by Ryan under his plan, but a balance of $77,088.34 on the Government’s costs of prosecution \nclaim remained unpaid. Ryan then renewed his request for determination of dischargeability. The \nbankruptcy court held that the unpaid portion of the Government’s claim for costs of prosecution was \nexcepted from discharge by § 1328(a)(3). Ryan appealed. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1168 \n \nSection 1328(a)(3) provides an exception to discharge in chapter 13 for “restitution, or a criminal fine.” It \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \n[A]s soon as practicable after the completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, the \ncourt shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under \nsection 502 of this title except any debt… \n \n(3) for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime \n[.] [emphasis added]. \n \nThe essential question, then, is whether these costs of prosecution constitute a “criminal fine.” \n \nStatutory interpretation begins with a review of the particular language used by Congress in the relevant \nversion of the law. [Citation.] \n \nThe term “criminal fine” is not defined in [Chapter 13] or anywhere else in the Bankruptcy Code. \nHowever, its use in § 1328(a)(3) implicates two important policies embedded in the Bankruptcy Code. \nFirst, in light of the objective to provide a fresh start for debtors overburdened by debts that they cannot \npay, exceptions to discharge are interpreted strictly against objecting creditors and in favor of \ndebtors. See, e.g. [Citations]. In chapter 13, this principle is particularly important because Congress \nadopted the liberal “superdischarge” provisions of § 1328 as an incentive to debtors to commit to a plan to \npay their creditors all of their disposable income over a period of years rather than simply discharging \ntheir debts in a chapter 7 liquidation. \n \n“[T]he dischargeability of debts in chapter 13 that are not dischargeable in chapter 7 represents a policy \njudgment that [it] is preferable for debtors to attempt to pay such debts to the best of their abilities over \nthree years rather than for those debtors to have those debts hanging over their heads indefinitely, \nperhaps for the rest of their lives.” [Citations.] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1169 \n \nA second, countervailing policy consideration is a historic deference, both in the Bankruptcy Code and in \nthe administration of prior bankruptcy law, to excepting criminal sanctions from discharge in bankruptcy. \nApplication of this policy is consistent with a general recognition that, “[t]he principal purpose of the \nBankruptcy Code is to grant a ‘fresh start’ to the ‘honest but unfortunate debtor.’” [Citation] (emphasis \nadded [in original]). \n \nThe legislative history is clear that [in its 1994 amendments to the bankruptcy law] Congress intended to \noverrule the result in [of a 1990 Supreme Court case so that]:…“[N]o debtor with criminal restitution \nobligations will be able to discharge them through any bankruptcy proceeding.”… \n \nThe imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor is different from ordering a defendant \nto pay criminal fines. Costs are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines are generally paid to a \nspecial fund for victims’ compensation and assistance in the U.S. Treasury.… \n \nTo honor the principle that exceptions to discharge are to be construed narrowly in favor of debtors, \nparticularly in chapter 13, where a broad discharge was provided by Congress as an incentive for debtors \nto opt for relief under that chapter rather than under chapter 7, it is not appropriate to expand the scope \nof the [Chapter 13] exception beyond the terms of the statute.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality",

            "chunk": "budgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.",

Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing\nregulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States.

SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most\nimportant aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n•\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic\nconditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n•\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are\nimportant aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,\nhow it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help\nto evaluate a firm.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nElements of a Financial Plan",

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should",

Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular\ninstructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for\nmany followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a “pack of bike\nriders,” familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The\ncompany name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.\nPeloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public\nwith an initial public offering in September 2019.

They were selling an experience, not a bicycle. The\nequipment is expensive—a Peloton bike typically costs over $2,000. Peloton equips its studios with state-of-\nthe-art camera and music systems and pays its instructors top dollar. Along the way, the founders made\nseveral critical financial decisions. They kept control of the firm by using private funding at the start.\nHow can we tell if Peloton has managed its resources well? The company started with $400,000 of funding\nto develop a prototype in 2012. By 2018, firm value increased to $4 billion with yet another round of private\ninvestor funding. As of April 2021, Peloton is a publicly traded company with a stock value of $34 billion. The\nexecutives are sacrificing profits in the short term to generate growth and long-term profitability. The firm\nuses its financial statements to identify sources and uses of funds, to test the effectiveness of advertising,\nand to forecast future profitability. Analysts like the firm, the stock price is up, and by many financial\nmeasures, Peloton has been a great success.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies the following\nas typical business analyst duties:\n•\nGathering information about problems to be solved or procedures to be improved\n•\nInterviewing personnel and conducting onsite observations to determine the methods, equipment, and\n5\nIbid.\n20\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npersonnel that will be needed\n•\nAnalyzing financial data, revenues and expenditures, and employment reports, among other data\n•\nFinding root causes for problems and proposing solutions that may include new systems, procedures, or\npersonnel changes\n•\nPresenting findings to decision makers\n•\nConferring with managers to ensure changes work\nThe average salary for management analysts was $85,260 in May 2019, and the BLS projects 11% growth, or\nabout 94,000 new jobs, over the next decade.6\n1.5\nMarkets and Participants\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify primary and secondary markets.\n•\nIdentify key market players.\nPrimary and Secondary Markets\nSimply put, the primary market is the market for “new” securities, and the secondary market is the market\nfor “used” securities. Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell.

When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\n7\nUnited States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\n23\nHowever, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual\nfirm and industry forecasts. Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations.

Who had the highest\noverall increase in the market? What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?\nJust to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, Donald Trump or\nBarack Obama?\nEach of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock\nmarket, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own\nlimited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize\nonly their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of\nthese factors.\nA common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and\nmicroeconomics is a bottom-up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement.

As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation.

                    "answer": "The disadvantages of a sole proprietorship include unlimited liability, limited life, and limited access to capital. Unlimited liability means that the sole proprietor is personally responsible for all the debts and obligations of the business. This can put the owner's personal assets at risk if the business fails. Limited life means that the business ceases to exist when the sole proprietor dies or otherwise leaves the business. Limited access to capital means that the sole proprietor may have difficulty obtaining loans or other forms of financing for the business."

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\nRole of Management\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have\ndifferent functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is",

Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\n48\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPepsiCo\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry.

They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors.

Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any\ngulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it\nis recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also\nrecognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.\nImpact of ESG Ratings\nIn recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being\nevaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These ratings and\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal\nimportance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per Figure 2.3 below. It is critical for the senior management\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\nwhen necessary.\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\ncompany. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to\n2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards\n53\nrepresent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term\nvalue of company stock.\nThus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a\npoor rating can have a negative impact on a firm’s share price and result in substantial problems. In any case,\nit is important to note that ESG is only a starting point from which it is possible to gather indicators on a\nbusiness and its direction.

The underlying purpose of these requirements is to provide shareholders and\nthe investment community with important operational and financial information on a regular basis and in a\ntransparent manner. Reports filed with the SEC include the annual Form 10-K, quarterly Form 10-Qs, and\ncurrent periodic Form 8-Ks, in addition to proxy reports and certain shareholder and affiliate reporting\ndocuments. Quarterly 10-Qs are an ongoing and regular reporting requirement of publicly traded companies\nand are to be filed within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.\nDepending on a company’s size and the complexity of its operation, a firm is likely to issue an earnings press\nrelease and conduct a conference call with the investment community within this same 45-day period. There\nis no legal requirement for companies to do either of these things, but experts in IR view these\ncommunications tools as best practice. They can add context and commentary to the reported financial\nresults.\nIt is important for companies to do their planning and not enter a quarterly earnings conference call\nunprepared. There is a multitude of available resources for companies to analyze and review in preparation.\nAmong such resources are industry reports prepared by government agencies; the financial reports and\nearnings calls of competing organizations, both within and outside of a company’s primary industry; and\nfinancial research reports prepared by various covering analysts, who follow the specific company and are\nemployed by financial brokerage firms.\nInvestment Meetings and Conferences\nOrganizing the annual meeting of shareholders, investor roadshows, and investment conferences is no easy\ntask for any corporation, though all of these audience-facing events are critical to maintaining strong relations\nwith shareholders and the investment community.

The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for\nsweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30. At a price of $30, the quantity demanded of 20 sweatshirts\nequals the quantity supplied of 20 sweatshirts.\nFigure 3.6 Graph of Demand and Supply for Sweatshirts\nChanges in Equilibrium Price\nA price that is either too high (above the equilibrium price) or too low (below the equilibrium price) is not\nsustainable in a competitive market. Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either\nsupply or demand changes.\nIf supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as in Figure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will\nfall. With the original supply curve, Supply1, the equilibrium price was $15; quantity demanded and quantity\nsupplied were both 30 pizzas at that price. If a new pizza restaurant opens, increasing the supply of pizzas to\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n73\nSupply2, the equilibrium will move from Equilibrium1\nto Equilibrium2\n. The new equilibrium price will\nbe $10. This new equilibrium is associated with a quantity demanded of 40 pizzas and a quantity supplied of 40\npizzas.\nFigure 3.7 Supply Curve Changes When Supply Increases An increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and an increase\nin quantity demanded.\nIt is important to note that the demand curve in Figure 3.7 does not move. In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement an increase in quantity demanded.\nDistinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an\nincrease in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.\nEquilibrium price will also fall if demand falls. Remember that a decrease in demand is represented as a shift\nof the demand curve inward to the left. In Figure 3.8, you can see how a decrease in demand causes a change\nfrom\nto\n.\nFigure 3.8 A Decrease in Demand\nAt the new equilibrium,\n, the price of a pizza is $10. The new equilibrium quantity is 20 pizzas. Note that the\nsupply curve has not moved.

Show this movement in a graph. What happens to\nthe equilibrium? What are some reasons you can think of that may have caused this change in demand?\nSolution:\nThis is an increase in demand. At every price, consumers now want to purchase more sweatshirts than they\ndid before. This is shown in the graph as a movement of the demand curve outward to the right. Both the\nequilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will rise because of this increase in demand. The equilibrium\nprice will now be $40, and the equilibrium quantity of sweatshirts will be 30. Note that there is not an\nincrease in supply; the supply curve does not move. There is simply an increase in quantity supplied (see\nFigure 3.9).\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n75\nFigure 3.9 Graph Showing Increase in Sweatshirt Supply\nA change in any of the factors that are assumed to be held constant under the ceteris paribus assumption\ncould have caused the demand curve to shift to the right. Perhaps a rise in consumers’ incomes led them to\npurchase more clothing, including sweatshirts. Or an unseasonably cool fall could result in more people\npurchasing sweatshirts.

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls. Whenever there is inflation, a $100 bill will not\npurchase as much as it did before.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCPI Inflation Calculator\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, $100 in January 1913 had the same purchasing power as\n$1,722.45 in January 2000 and $2,699.20 in January 2021. If you would like to compare the purchasing power\nof a dollar amount in two different time periods, you can use the CPI Inflation Calculator\n(https://openstax.org/r/cpi-inflation-calculator). You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project\nAlthough the concept of inflation as a rise in the general price level is simple, measuring and documenting\nthis increase is complicated. The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n77\ndelivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows\neconomists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a\ntypical family’s purchases.\nIn an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods\npurchased and the purchasing habits of families, Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon founded the Billion\nPrices Project. Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world. The Billion Prices Project website\n(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project) provides measures for inflation using this data as well as\nresearch papers regarding macroeconomic research.\nHistorical Trends in the Inflation Rate\nInflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed in Figure 3.10. The graph shows that for the past\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.\nFigure 3.10 Rate of Inflation Measured by the Consumer Price Index, 1947–20202\nThe Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a measure of the average monthly\nchange in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers between any two time periods. It can also\nrepresent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88% of the total\npopulation, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed workers, short-\nterm workers, unemployed workers, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\nThe CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation fares, service fees (e.g., water and\nsewer service), and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and\napproximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are\naveraged with weights representing their importance in the spending of a particular group. The index\nmeasures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the\noriginal unadjusted index distributed, the BLS also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series\nreflects all factors that may influence a change in prices.

For the individuals who find themselves without\na job, unemployment causes financial hardship. From a macroeconomics standpoint, unemployment means\nthat society has labor resources that are not being fully utilized.\nNot everyone who is without a job is unemployed. To be considered unemployed, a person must be (1)\njobless, (2) actively seeking work, and (3) able to take a job. The official unemployment rate is the percentage\nof the labor force that is unemployed. It is calculated as\nNote that the unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed, rather\nthan the percent of the total population. Only those who are currently employed or who meet the definition of\nbeing unemployed are counted in the labor force. In other words, someone who is retired or a stay-at-home\nparent and is not seeking employment is not counted as unemployed and is not part of the labor force.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the US Department of Labor reports the unemployment rate each\nmonth. These figures are attained through an interview process of 60,000 households conducted by the\nCensus Bureau.

A country’s GDP is the dollar value of\nall of the final goods and service produced within that country during a year. GDP measures the value of all of\nthe automobiles produced, apples grown, heart surgeries performed, students educated, and all other new\ngoods and services produced in a current year.\nHow Is GDP Measured?\nGDP can be measured by adding up all of the items that are purchased in the economy. Purchases are divided\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\nexports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,\ncups of coffee, and clothing. Consumption expenditure accounts for about two-thirds of the US GDP.4\nInvestment spending refers primarily to purchases by businesses.

The investment\nspending category is roughly 15% to 18% of the US GDP.\nGovernment spending includes spending by federal, state, and local governments. Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported\nfrom other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because\nwe already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must\nsubtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation. Net exports equals exports from the United States minus\nimports from other countries. Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.\nHistorical Trends in GDP\nUS GDP over the past 70 years is represented by the blue line in Figure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced. The red line in Figure 3.12 represents the real GDP. Although its\ngrowth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70\nyears.\n5\n“GDP (Current US$): United States.” The World Bank. 2020. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n81\nFigure 3.12 Growth of the US GDP6 Gross domestic product (GDP), the featured measure of US output, is the market value of the\ngoods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States.

A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\nborrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At that\ninterest rate, the quantity supplied of loanable funds exactly equals the quantity demanded of loanable funds.\nThere is no shortage of loanable funds, nor is there any surplus.\n10\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. “US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions.” Last updated July 19, 2021.\nhttps://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions\n86\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNominal Interest Rates\nThe nominal interest rate is the stated, or quoted, interest rate. If you want to borrow money to purchase a\ncar and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.\nOr suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.",

If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents.

Currency appreciation occurs when it\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates\n89\nCurrency prices are determined in the marketplace through the same types of supply-and-demand forces we\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\nCurrency Depreciation\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was\n, it\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\ndepreciate.\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\nExchange Rate Risk\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk. As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange",

It is a valuable tool for travelers, business people, and anyone who needs to make international transactions. The currency converter takes into account the current exchange rate between two currencies, allowing you to see how much one currency is worth in terms of another. For example, if you want to know how much $100 USD is worth in Euros, you can enter $100 USD into the currency converter and it will tell you that it is approximately €85.62. This is a very useful tool for anyone who needs to make international transactions or simply wants to know how much their money is worth in another country."

This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\nexposure. The ski lodge in Colorado will find that its customers from Mexico decrease when the dollar\nappreciates. Likewise, when the dollar appreciates, some of the ski lodge’s US-based customers may choose\ninstead to visit a resort in Mexico, where their purchasing power is strong.\n90\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n3.6\nSources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nInterpret economic data.\n•\nCompute the percent change for economic variables.\nFRED: Federal Reserve Economic Data\nOne of the largest sources of economic data is the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.12 This\ndatabase is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and contains more than 765,000 economic\ntime series.

Looking at the percentage change in Figure 3.20 is helpful for\ndetecting when the economy is growing but the growth is slowing. If the percentage change is positive but\nlower than it was for the previous quarter, then GDP is growing, but the growth rate is slowing.\nIndexes\nAn index is created to track the performance of a particular aspect of the economy or the financial markets. An\nindex helps compare the level of a variable at one point in time relative to another point in time. Indexes are\noften used when movement over time is more important than the absolute level of the variable at any one\npoint in time.\nEarlier in this chapter, we looked at the rate of change in the CPI to measure the rate of inflation. In its raw\nform, the CPI is an index. Remember that the CPI is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods. When\nthe index is created, the total cost of the market basket, whether it is $300 or $950, is irrelevant. What\neconomists are interested in is the magnitude of the difference in cost of the same market basket at a later\ndate.\nIn order to focus on the change over time, a base year is identified. The cost of the market basket in the base\n13\nData from JP, Cabinet Office. “Real Gross Domestic Product for Japan (JPNRGDPEXP).” FRED.

Let’s assume that the market basket costs $300 in the base year. If the same\nbasket of goods costs $330 the following year, then the index level the following year would be 110. The index\nlevel increases by 10% when the cost of the market basket increases by 10%. This makes it easy to compare\ndifferent measures of inflation.\nFor example, suppose a market basket costs 40,000 yen in the first year and 42,000 yen in the second year. In\nthe base year, the CPI in Japan would be set at 100; the following year, the index would rise to 105 (because of\nthe 5% rise in the market basket cost). Comparing the levels of the index in Japan with the index in the United\nStates allows you to compare inflation trends in the two countries.\nTable 3.6 contains the CPI for the United States, Japan, and Switzerland for each decade since 1970. A base year\nof 1970 is used for all three countries, so the index level is 100 for all three countries in 1970. You can see that\nJapan has experienced virtually no inflation for the last several decades. If the index level remains the same\nfrom one year to the next, there is a zero rate of inflation. Negative rates of inflation, or deflation, would be\nassociated with a falling index level.\nYear United States Switzerland Japan\n1970\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n1980\n212.3\n162.3\n232.5\n1990\n336.5\n226.4\n291.2\n2000\n443.5\n278.2\n322.1\n2010\n561.6\n304.3\n313.6\n2020\n666.6\n302.3\n331.8\nTable 3.6 CPI Levels for the United States,\nSwitzerland, and Japan15\nUsing an index level helps us compare the impact that inflation has had on the cost of living in the three\ncountries.

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\nhave depreciated.\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. Over 765,000 time series of data are available. In addition to being viewable in\ngraphical and text form on the FRED site, the data is easily downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.\nKey Terms\nbusiness cycle\na period of economic expansion followed by economic contraction\nceteris paribus\nholding all other things constant\nconsumer price index (CPI)\na measure of inflation based on the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family of four might purchase\ncore inflation index\na measure of inflation that removes food and energy prices from the CPI\ndemand\nthe quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase during a given\ntime period, ceteris paribus\neconomic exposure\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s sales and number of\ncustomers\nequilibrium\nthe point at which the demand and supply curves for a good or service intersect\nequilibrium price\nthe price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\nexpansion\nthe part of the business cycle in which GDP is growing\n3 • Summary\n95\nGDP deflator\na measure of inflation tracked by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, intended to measure what\nGDP would be if prices did not change from one year to the next",

Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\n102\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexpense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\nWho Uses Each Method?\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is\nreceived). Cash can often be received a significant amount of time after the initial transaction. Considering this\namount allows accountants to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and complete information to stakeholders.\nThere are several reasons accrual-basis accounting is preferred to cash-basis accounting. Accrual-basis\naccounting is required by GAAP because it typically provides a better sense of the financial well-being of a\ncompany. Accrual-based accounting information allows management to analyze a company’s progress, and\nmanagement can use that information to improve their business. Accrual accounting is also used to assist\ncompanies in securing financing because banks will typically require a company to provide accrual-basis\nfinancial income statements. The Internal Revenue Service requires businesses to report using accrual-basis\ninformation when preparing tax returns. In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based\naccounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.\nSo why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-\nbasis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from\nsuch requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?",

On the right, the same credit\nsale is recorded under the accrual basis of accounting.\nLet’s now explore the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting using an expense.\n108\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAssume a business purchases $160 worth of printing supplies from a supplier (vendor). Similar to a sale, a\npurchase of merchandise can be paid for at the time of sale using cash (also a check or credit card) or at a later\ndate (on account). A purchase paid with cash at the time of the sale would be recorded in the financial\nstatements under both cash basis and accrual basis of accounting. It makes sense because the business\nreceived the printing supplies from the supplier and paid the supplier at the same time. It is considered two\nevents that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nIf the purchase was made on account (also called a credit purchase), however, the transaction would be\nrecorded differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash basis of accounting, the $160\npurchase on account would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is paid, as stipulated by\nthe seller’s terms. For example, if the printing supplies were received on July 17 and the payment terms were\n15 days, no transaction would be recorded until August 1, when the goods were paid for. Under the accrual\nbasis of accounting, this purchase would be recorded in the financial statements at the time the business\nreceived the printing supplies from the supplier (July 17). The reason the purchase would be recorded is that\nthe business reports that it bought $160 worth of printing supplies from its vendors. The fact that the business\nwill pay later is viewed as a separate issue under accrual accounting. Table 4.1 summarizes these examples\nunder the different bases of accounting.\nTransaction\nUnder Cash-Basis Accounting\nUnder Accrual-Basis Accounting\n$200 sale for cash\nRecorded in financial statements at time of\nsale\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof sale\n$200 sale on\naccount\nNot recorded in financial statements until\ncash is received\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof sale\n$160 purchase for\ncash\nRecorded in financial statements at time of\npurchase\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof purchase\n$160 purchase on\naccount\nNot recorded in financial statements until\ncash is paid\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof purchase\nTable 4.1 How Transactions Are Viewed under Cash and Accrual Accounting\nBusinesses often sell items for cash as well as on account, where payment terms are extended for a period of\ntime (for example, 30 to 45 days). Likewise, businesses often purchase items from suppliers (also called\nvendors) for cash or, more likely, on account. Under the cash basis of accounting, these transactions would not\nbe recorded until the cash is exchanged. In contrast, under accrual accounting, the transactions are recorded\nwhen the transaction occurs, regardless of when the cash is received or paid.\n4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\n109\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEthics in Revenue Recognition\nBecause each industry typically has a different method for recognizing income, revenue recognition is one\nof the most difficult tasks for accountants, as it involves a number of ethical dilemmas related to income\nreporting. To provide an industry-wide approach, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 and other\nrelated updates were implemented to clarify revenue recognition rules. The American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\nrevenue recognition.\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses.

Your new colleague, Milan, is helping a client company organize its\naccounting records by types of assets and expenditures.

They have given you the\nfollowing list and asked for your help to sort through it. Help your colleague classify the expenditures as\neither capitalized or expensed, and note which assets are property, plant, and equipment.\nExpenditures:\n•\nNormal repair and maintenance on the manufacturing facility\n•\nCost of taxes on new equipment used in business operations\n•\nShipping costs on new equipment used in business operations\n•\nCost of a minor repair on existing equipment used in business operations\nAssets:\n112\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nLand next to the production facility held for use next year as a place to build a warehouse\n•\nLand held for future resale when the value increases\n•\nEquipment used in the production process\nSolution:\nExpenditures:\n•\nNormal repair and maintenance on the manufacturing facility: expensed\n•\nCost of taxes on new equipment used in business operations: capitalized\n•\nShipping costs on new equipment used in business operations: capitalized\n•\nCost of a minor repair on existing equipment used in business operations: expensed\nAssets:\n•\nLand next to the production facility held for use next year as a place to build a warehouse: property,\nplant, and equipment\n•\nLand held for future resale when the value increases: investment\n•\nEquipment used in the production process: property, plant, and equipment\nWhy are the costs of putting a long-term asset into service capitalized and written off as expenses\n(depreciated) over the economic life of the asset? Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it\nis expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs\nover its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s\nfinancial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in\nexpenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense\nrecognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the\nrevenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over\nthe years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.\nAs stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated\ncosts on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,\nthey will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry in Figure 4.8).\nFigure 4.8 Journal Entry for Machine/Cash\nWhen capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This\nincludes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.\nFor example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the\nland would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.\nOver time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the\nasset.\n3\nIn the Chapter 4 financial statements, a number contained within parentheses is a negative number, such as the “Accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization” line item.\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\n113\nWhat Is Depreciation?\nWhen a business purchases a long-term asset (used for more than one year), it classifies the asset based on\nwhether the asset is used in the business’s operations. If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\ntypically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.",

However, since these financial statements\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing. For\n122\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexample, a customer may buy a good on account. Revenues would be recorded, but cash would not yet be\nreceived. The same is true on the expenses side. An expense can be incurred, such as an electric bill, but cash\nmay not have been paid out yet. Thus, an expense is recorded and recognized on the income statement, but\ncash has not yet been given up. The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net\nincome (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.\n4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\n123\nSummary\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\naccounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash\nbasis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.\n4.2 Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\nDouble-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts\nimpacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual-basis accounting\nan accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\nwhen paid\ncapitalize\nthe process in which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet and its allocated costs are\nexpensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life\ncash-basis accounting\na method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash\ncredit\na record of financial information on the right side of an account\ndebit\na record of financial information on the left side of each account\n124\n4 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndepreciation\nthe process of allocating the costs of a tangible asset over the asset’s economic life\ndouble-entry accounting\nan accounting method that requires the sum of the debits to equal the sum of the\ncredits for each transaction\nexpense\na cost associated with providing goods or services\nexpense recognition\n(also, matching principle) matches expenses with associated revenues in the period in\nwhich the revenues were generated\ngains\nincreases in organizational value from activities that are “incidental or peripheral” to the primary\npurpose of the business\nincome statement",

The first statement prepared is the income statement.\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\nrather than a net loss.\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\nfuture results.\nFirms report their sales and any reductions to sales separately on the income statement. They begin with\ngross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and\n$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is\ncustomary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margin\ngross profit/sales.) Cost of\ngoods sold includes the costs directly involved in making the product that was sold during the period.\nCommon examples of costs included in cost of goods sold include direct labor, direct materials, and the\noverhead assigned to the product in production. For a service business, this would include its direct labor and\nany materials used to deliver its services. For a retail firm like Clear Lake Sporting Goods, this would include\nthe costs of all the goods it purchased for resale. Clear Lake’s COGS is seen at $50,000 and $60,000 for the\nprior and current years. Note that different types of companies will have different types of costs deducted in\ntheir Cost of Goods section. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a retailer, or merchandiser that buys good to resell.\nTheir cost of goods includes the cost of goods they purchased to resell. In the link to learning, you will explore\nApple, a technology manufacturer. Their cost of goods would include the cost to manufacture the goods they\n130\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nsell. Another type of firm is a service firm. A law office, for example, would include primarily the cost of labor in\ntheir cost of services.\nGross profit is a reflection of how profitable the firm’s performance was in its core business function. It\nincludes only the core business and direct costs of performing that business. If the company were a shoe\ncompany, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply making the shoes it sold. If it\nwere a bakery, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply baking the goods it sold.\nGross profit shows financial statement users how effective the business is at generating top-line profits on\ntheir core business function. It does not reflect the performance of other areas of the firm such as other\noperating costs to support the direct production process, indirect costs, and financing.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see its gross profit in Figure 5.2.

Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out.

In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\nearnings.

The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable? Again, the answer is no.\nRemember, the accounting equation rests on the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. This\nmeans that every transaction has two sides: a debit and a credit. They must be equal. When Clear Lake records\nan expense of $1,500, it must also record the other half of that transaction. In this case, the company incurred\nutilities expenses throughout the period “on account,” which means it records an increase in their accounts\npayable. When the invoice comes due, another transaction must then be recorded to reduce accounts payable\nand reduce cash. Accounts payable is a liability found on the balance sheet, normally a current liability. The\nexpense incurred caused the payable, but it is distinctly separate from the payable (see Figure 5.12).\nFigure 5.12 Connections between Expenses and Accounts Payable\n140\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n5.4\nThe Statement of Owner’s Equity\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the concept of owner’s equity.\n•\nOutline the purpose and importance of the statement of owner’s equity.\n•\nIdentify the structure and key elements of the statement of owner’s equity.\nWhat Is Equity?\nRecall that the accounting equation can help us see what is owned (assets), who is owed (liabilities), and finally\nwho the owners are (equity).

Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task. A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements. Common-size financial statements, also termed vertical analysis,\nrestate the financial statement items as a percentage of a base item. Doing so helps reveal relationships\nbetween items, aids in assessing performance over time, and makes it easier to compare one company to\nanother, regardless of size (thus the name common-size).\n5.7\nCommon-Size Statements\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nPrepare common-size statements.\n•\nAssess organizational performance using common-size statements.\n•\nUse industry comparisons to assess organizational performance.\nCommon-Size Income Statements\nA common-size income statement is created by restating each line as a percentage of net sales. Expressing\neach item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to\nmake comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes. The formula to calculate\neach item on the income statement is:\nUsing Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year income statement, we can see how each line item in it is divided\nby net sales in order to assemble a common-size income statement (see Figure 5.20).\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n149\nFigure 5.20 Common-Size Income Statement\nIt may seem cumbersome to create a common-size statement. However, a simple tool like Microsoft Excel can\nbe quite handy in making the process easier and faster. The same formula can be copied and replicated in\neach income statement line, making the calculations much faster. In Figure 5.21, you can see the formulas",

Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

It differs\ndepending on the role and perspective of those performing the analysis. For example, your personal\naccountant will have different goals and needs in making recommendations to you about your personal\nfinances. All accounting professionals use financial analysis to check for validity, accurate data, compliance in\nreporting, and more.\nSome tactics for managing your personal finances can be the same as for managing business finances. For\nexample, reducing expenses and maximizing returns on long-term investments are always good practices.\nDebt can also be a beneficial tool in both personal and professional finances when used appropriately. Debt is\nneither inherently good nor bad; it simply needs to be properly managed in order to achieve a reasonable\nreturn in exchange for the cost and risk it poses.\nThough the process and tools may be similar, financial analysis from a business perspective has different goals\nand needs. Investors are looking to identify firm performance, financial health, and profitability. Financial\nanalysts closely review information found on financial statements so they can make informed business\ndecisions. The income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows,\namong other financial information, are analyzed for internal and external stakeholders and provide a company\nwith valuable information about its overall performance and specific areas for improvement. The analysis can\nMeasures of Financial Health\n6\n6 • Why It Matters\n165\nhelp with budgeting and making decisions about where the company could cut costs, how it might increase\nrevenues, and what capital investment opportunities it should pursue.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFinancial Analyst\nLots of individuals and companies perform financial analysis. One of these roles is that of a financial\nanalyst. The skills and qualifications of a financial analyst vary widely from one industry to another, but\nthere are a number of similarities in individuals who hold these roles. As you watch the video about\nfinancial analysts (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-financial-analysts), consider your own career path\nand how your skills, abilities, and interests may fit this role.\n6.1\nRatios: Condensing Information into Smaller Pieces\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the importance of financial statement analysis in making informed decisions about business\nopportunities.\n•\nOutline the limitations of financial statement analysis in making investment decisions.\nWhen considering the outcomes from analysis, it is important for a company to understand that the data\ngenerated needs to be compared to similar data within the industry at large as well as that of close\ncompetitors.

Figure 6.2 shows the comparative income statements and\nbalance sheets for the past two years.\nFigure 6.2 Comparative Income Statements and Year-End Balance Sheets Note that the comparative income statements and\n6.2 • Operating Efficiency Ratios\n167\nbalance sheets have been simplified here and do not fully reflect all possible company accounts.\nTo begin an analysis of receivables, it’s important to first understand the cycles and periods used in the\ncalculations.\nOperating Cycle\nA period is one operating cycle of a business. The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the\naccounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make\ninventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of\nfishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other\ncurrent projects. The lower turnover rate may signal a high level of bad debt accounts. The determination of a\nhigh or low turnover rate really depends on the standards of the company’s industry. It’s key to note the\ntradeoff in adjusting credit terms. Loose credit terms may attract more customers but may also increase bad\ndebt expense. Tighter credit terms may attract fewer customers but may also reduce bad debt expense.\nThe formula for accounts receivable turnover is\nNet credit sales are sales made on credit only; cash sales are not included because they do not produce\nreceivables. However, many companies do not report credit sales separately from cash sales, so “net sales”\nmay be substituted for “net credit sales” in this case. Beginning and ending accounts receivable refer to the\n168\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbeginning and ending balances in accounts receivable for the period. The beginning accounts receivable\nbalance is the same figure as the ending accounts receivable balance from the prior period.\nWhen computing the accounts receivable turnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, let’s assume net credit sales\nmake up $100,000 of the $120,000 of the net sales found on the income statement in the current year.\nTo gain a better understanding of its ratio performance, Clear Lake Sporting Goods can compare its turnover\nto industry averages, key competitors, and its own historical ratios. Given this outcome, the managers may\nwant to consider stricter credit lending practices to make sure credit customers are of a higher quality. They\nmay also need to be more aggressive with collecting any outstanding accounts.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nAccounts Receivable Turnover",

What does the outcome mean for Target?\nDays’ Sales in Inventory\nDays’ sales in inventory expresses the number of days it takes a company to turn inventory into sales. The\nfewer the number of days, the more quickly the company can sell its inventory. The greater the number of\ndays, the longer it takes to sell its inventory. The formula for days’ sales in inventory is\nClear Lake Sporting Goods’ days’ sales in inventory is\nDepending on the industry, 243 days may be a long time to sell inventory. While industry dictates what is an\nacceptable number of days to sell inventory, 243 days is likely to be unsustainable long-term. Remember, it’s\nimportant to not take one ratio out of context. Review the ratio in conjunction with other ratios and other\nfinancial data. For example, we might review the days’ sales in inventory along with accounts receivable\nturnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods relative to the industry average to get a better picture of Clear Lake’s\nperformance in this area.\n6.2 • Operating Efficiency Ratios\n171\n6.3\nLiquidity Ratios\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate current, quick, and cash ratios to assess a firm’s liquidity and make informed business decisions.\n•\nAssess organizational performance using liquidity ratios.\nLiquidity refers to the business’s ability to manage current assets or convert assets into cash in order to meet\nshort-term cash needs, another aspect of a firm’s financial health. Examples of the most liquid assets include\ncash, accounts receivable, and inventory for merchandising or manufacturing businesses. The reason these\nare among the most liquid assets is that these assets will be turned into cash more quickly than land or\nbuildings, for example. Accounts receivable represents goods or services that have already been sold and will\ntypically be paid/collected within 30 to 45 days.\nInventory is less liquid than accounts receivable because the product must first be sold before it generates\ncash (either through a cash sale or sale on account). Inventory is, however, more liquid than land or buildings\nbecause, under most circumstances, it is easier and quicker for a business to find someone to purchase its\ngoods than it is to find a buyer for land or buildings.\nCurrent Ratio\nThe current ratio is closely related to working capital; it represents the current assets divided by current\nliabilities. The current ratio utilizes the same amounts as working capital (current assets and current liabilities)\nbut presents the amount in ratio, rather than dollar, form. That is, the current ratio is defined as current\nassets/current liabilities. The interpretation of the current ratio is similar to working capital. A ratio of greater\nthan one indicates that the firm has the ability to meet short-term obligations with a buffer, while a ratio of\nless than one indicates that the firm should pay close attention to the composition of its current assets as well\nas the timing of the current liabilities.\nThe current ratio in the current year for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is\nA 2:1 ratio means the company has twice as many current assets as current liabilities; typically, this would be\nplenty to cover obligations. A 2:1 ratio is actually quite high for most companies and most industries. Again,\nit’s recommended that ratios be used in conjunction with one another. An analyst would likely look at the high\ncurrent ratio and low accounts receivable turnover to begin asking questions about management\nperformance, as this might indicate a trouble area (high inventory and slow collections).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTarget Corporation\nAs we have learned, the current ratio shows how well a company can cover short-term liabilities with short-\nterm assets. Look through the balance sheet in the 2019 Annual Report for Target (https://openstax.org/r/\nannual-report-for-target) and calculate the current ratio.

The conversion of\n172\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninventory and prepaid expenses to cash can sometimes take more time than the liquidation of other current\nassets.

The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn\nor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of\nor $105, in the account at the end of one\nyear.\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\nand five?\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n195\nUsing the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:\nHow the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding\nMelvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in\ninterest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future. His friend suggests finding an\naccount or some form of investment with a greater interest rate than the 5% he can get at his local bank.\nMelvin thinks he can leave his money in an account or investment for a total of five years. He found\ninvestments that will provide annual returns of 6%, 7%, 10%, and 12%. Using the\nformula, we can complete the following calculations for him:\nAgain, Melvin likes this information, and he states that he will try to find the highest interest rate available. This\nmakes sense, but it’s important to remember that investments are usually not guaranteed to earn you specific\ninterest rates, or rates of return. Most investments, other than Treasury investments such as Treasury bonds,\ncarry some form of financial risk, either small or large, and the greater the rate of return, the more likely it is\nthat the risk associated with the investment will also be greater. This risk does not have any effect on the\nfuture calculations we have just completed, but it an important factor to bear in mind and consider well before\nmoving ahead and putting your money in any investment or financial instrument.\n7.3\nMethods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how future dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nExplain how present dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how discount rates are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how growth rates are calculated.\n•\nIllustrate how periods of time for specified growth are calculated.\n•\nUse a financial calculator and Excel to solve TVM problems.\nWe can determine future value by using any of four methods: (1) mathematical equations, (2) calculators with\nfinancial functions, (3) spreadsheets, and (4) FVIF tables. With the advent and wide acceptance and use of\nfinancial calculators and spreadsheet software, FVIF (and other such time value of money tables and factors)\nhave become obsolete, and we will not discuss them in this text.

As an example, in the spreadsheet\nshown in Figure 7.3, we calculated that the future value of $100 five years from now at a 5% interest rate would\nbe $127.63. By reversing this process, we can safely state that $127.63 received five years from now with a 5%\ninterest (or discount) rate would have a value of just $100 today. Thus, $100 is its present value. In Excel, the\nPV function is used to determine present value (see Figure 7.7).\nFigure 7.7 Using the PV Function in Excel\nThe formula in cell E1 uses cell references in a similar fashion to our FV example spreadsheet above. Also\nsimilar to our earlier example is the hard-coded formula for this calculation, which is shown in cell E6.

Our present value and future value are the same as in that\nexample, and our time period is now 8.5 years, which is just under the result we arrived at (8.77 years) in\n7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\n213\nthe periods example.\nSo, if we are now working with a slightly shorter time frame for the savings to grow from $15,000 into\n$25,000, then we would expect to have a slightly greater growth rate. That is exactly how the answer turns\nout, as the calculated required interest rate of approximately 6.19% is just slightly greater than the growth\nrate of 6% used in the previous example. So, based on this, it looks like our answer here passes a simple\n“sanity check” review.\n7.4\nApplications of TVM in Finance\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how the time value of money can impact your personal financial goals.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to inflation.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to financial risk.\n•\nExplain how compounding period frequency affects the time value of money.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet’s say you want to buy a new car next year, and the one you have your eye on should be selling for $20,000\na year from now.

If the government is currently paying 5% per year on savings bonds, how much will\nit cost you today to buy this savings bond?\nThe $1,000 face value of the bond is the future value, and the number of years n that Charlotte must wait to\nget this face value is 30 years. The interest rate r is 5.0% and is the discount rate for the savings bond. Applying\nthe present value equation, we calculate the current price of this savings bond as follows:\nSo, it would cost you $231.38 to purchase this 30-year, 5%, $1,000 face-valued bond.\nWhat we have done in the above example is reduce, or discount, the future value of the bond to arrive at a\nvalue expressed in today’s dollars. Effectively, this discounting process is the exact opposite of compounding\ninterest that we covered earlier in our discussion of future value.\nAn important concept to remember is that compounding is the process that takes a present valuation of\nmoney to some point in the future, while discounting takes a future value of money and equates it to present\ndollar value terms.\nCommon applications in which you might use the present value formula include determining how much\nmoney you would need to invest in an interest-bearing account today in order to finance a college education\nfor your oldest child and how much you would need to invest today to meet your retirement plans 30 years\nfrom now.\nTVM, Inflation, Compounding Interest, Investing, Opportunity Costs, and Risk\nThe time value of money (TVM) is a critical concept in understanding the value of money relative to the\namount of time it is held, saved, or invested. The TVM concept and its specific applications are frequently used\nby individuals and organizations that might wish to better understand the values of financial assets and to\nimprove investing and saving strategies, whether these are personal or within business environments.\nAs we have discussed, the key element behind the concept of TVM is that a given amount of money is worth\nmore today than that same amount of money will be at any point in the future. Again, this is because money\ncan be saved or invested in interest-bearing accounts or investments that will generate interest income over\ntime, thus resulting in increased savings and dollar values as time passes.\nInflation\nThe entire concept of TVM exists largely due to the presence of inflation. Inflation is defined as a general\nincrease in the prices of goods and services and/or a drop in the value of money and its purchasing power.\nThe purchasing power of the consumer dollar is a statistic tracked by the part of the US Bureau of Labor\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n215\nStatistics and is part of the consumer price index (CPI) data that is periodically published by that government\nagency. In a way, purchasing power can be viewed as a mirror image or exact opposite of inflation or increases\nin consumer prices, as measured by the CPI. Figure 7.18 demonstrates the decline in the purchasing power of\nthe consumer dollar over the 13-year period from 2007 to 2020.\nWith this in mind, we can work with the TVM formula and use it to help determine the present value of money\nyou have in hand today, as well as how this same amount of money may be valued at any specific point in the\nfuture and at any specific rate of interest.\nFigure 7.18 Historical Purchasing Power Decline as a Result of Inflation, 2007–2020 (data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\nThe Relationship between TVM and Inflation",

The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time\nto double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth\nrate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not\nas a percentage. So, as a result, we have\nThis formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for\nunderstanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary\nbalance.\nFollowing are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very\neasily, often enabling you to solve them “in your head,” without the need for a calculator or spreadsheet.\nLet’s say you are interested in knowing how long it will take your savings account balance to double. If your\naccount earns an interest rate of 9%, your money will take\nor 8, years to double. However, if you are\nearning only 6% on this same investment, your money will take\n, or 12, years to double.\nNow let’s say you have a specific future purchasing need and you know that you will need to double your\nmoney in five years. In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of\n, or 14.4%.\nThrough these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can\nhave significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\nTo further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s\ngross domestic product is growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n219\ntake the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\nNow, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in\n, or 36, years. However, if the rate of\ngrowth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in\n, or 6.55, years. By performing such\ncalculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\ngrowth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation\nand development.\nIt is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings\namounts that are earning interest.\nTo apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers\nwould lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in\n, or about 10.3,\nyears.\nIn an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of\n24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\nyou owe to the credit card company will double in only\n, or 3, years.\nSo, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage\npoint in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic\nforecasting models.\nIt is important to understand that the rule of 72 can be applied in any scenario where we have a quantity or an\namount that is in the process of growing or is expected to grow for any period of time into the future. A good\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in\nor\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only\n, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\nInvesting and Risk\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter.

Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.\nRisk and return are the factors that will cause a rational person to believe that a dollar risked should end up\nearning more than that single dollar.\nTo summarize, the concept of the time value of money and the related TVM formulas are extremely important\nbecause they can be used in different circumstances to help investors and savers understand the value of their\nmoney today relative to its earning potential in the future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that\ninflation has on your money and why saving your money early can help increase the value of your savings\ndollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects of inflation.\n220\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nOpportunity Costs\nThe concept of opportunity cost arises from the idea that there will always be possible options that are\nsacrificed with every option we decide on or for every choice that we make. For example, let’s consider the\ndecision to go to college after you graduate from high school. This decision, as with just about any other, will\ninvolve evaluating opportunity costs. If you choose to go to college, this will result in your sacrificing four years\nof potential earnings that you could have had if you had decided to take a job instead of attending school.\nAlso, in addition to the lost salary, you would be losing out on four years of work experience that could have\nhad a positive impact on your résumé or your future earnings prospects.\nOf course, the entire idea behind furthering one’s education is that you are hopeful that by choosing to go to\ncollege, you will increase the likelihood of earning a greater salary over the course of your lifetime than you\nwould have if you had chosen to join the workforce directly out of high school. So, this ends up being a bit of a\nrisk, but one that you have considered. The idea is that you are hoping for a more significant payoff down the\nroad than if you had made the decision not to continue with your studies. When it comes to opportunity costs\nand the time value of money, it is obvious that there will always be costs associated with every forgone\nfinancial opportunity we pass on when we make a different choice. The logical individual can only hope that\nthese choices produce a better end result than if we had made different choices and pursued any of our\nforgone alternatives. This also applies in situations where we may sit idly by and decide to take no action at all.\nFor example, if you are putting $1,000 in a savings account to save for a house, you may be giving up an\nopportunity to grow that money in an investment account that would earn a greater rate of return. In another\nexample, being able to calculate the future value of your money will tell you that instead of investing, you\nprobably should be paying down your 24% APR credit card debt that is costing you hundreds of dollars a\nmonth—hundreds of dollars more than you might earn from an investment account.\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n221\nSummary\n7.1 Now versus Later Concepts\nThis section discussed the underlying concepts of the time value of money (TVM). Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance",

Here is the stream of solutions for the\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\norder of operations:\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\namount.\nWe notice several things:\n1.\nThe formula must change because the annual payment is subtracted first, prior to the calculation of\nannual interest.\n2.\nWe accomplish the same result, aside from an insignificant rounding difference: the fund is depleted once\nthe last payment is withdrawn.\n3.\nThe last payment is withdrawn on the first day of the final year, not the last. Therefore, no interest is\nearned during the fifth and final year.\n234\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo reinforce this, let’s use the same approach for our lottery example above. Reviewing the facts, you have a\nchoice of receiving 10 annual payments of your $1.2 million winnings, each worth $120,000, and you discount\nat a rate of 9%. The only difference is that this time, you can receive your first $120,000 right away; you don’t\nhave to wait a year. This is now an annuity due. We solve it just as before, except that we multiply by one\nadditional period of interest, (1 + i):\nAgain, this result must be larger than the amount we determined when this was calculated as an ordinary\nannuity.\nThe calculations above, representing the present values of ordinary annuities and annuities due, have been\npresented on an annual basis. In Time Value of Money I, we saw that compounding and discounting\ncalculations can be based on non-annual periods as well, such as quarterly or monthly compounding and\ndiscounting. This aspect, quite common in periodic payment calculations, will be explored in a later section of\nthis chapter.\nCalculating Annuities Used in Structured Settlements\nIn addition to lottery payouts, annuity calculations are often used in structured settlements by attorneys at\nlaw. If you win a $450,000 settlement for an insurance claim, the opposing party may ask you to accept an\nannuity so that they can pay you in installments rather than a lump sum of cash. What would a fair cash\ndistribution by year mean? If you have a preferred discount rate (the percentage we all must know to\ncalculate the time value of money) of 6% and you expect equal distributions of $45,000 over 10 years,\nbeginning one year from now, you can use the present value of an annuity formula to compare the\nalternatives:\nBy substitution:\nIf the opposing attorney offered you a lump sum of cash less than that, all things equal, you would refuse it; if\n8.2 • Annuities\n235\nthe lump sum were greater than that, you would likely accept it.\nWhat if you negotiate the first payment to be made to you immediately, turning this ordinary annuity into an\nannuity due? As noted above, we simply multiply by one additional period of interest, (1 + 0.06). Repeating the\nlast step of the solution above and then multiplying by (1 + 0.06), we determine that\nYou would insist on that number as an absolute minimum before you would consider accepting the offered\nstream of payments.\nTo further verify that ordinary annuity can be converted into an annuity due by multiplying the solution by one\nadditional period’s worth of interest before applying the annuity factor to the payment, we can divide the\ndifference between the two results by the value of the original annuity. When the result is expressed as a\npercent, it must be the same as the rate of interest used in the annuity calculations. Using our example of an\nannuity with five payments of $25,000 at 8%, we compare the present values of the ordinary annuity of\n$99,817.81 and the annuity due of $107,803.24.\nThe result shows that the present value of the annuity due is 8% higher than the present value of the ordinary\nannuity.\nCalculating the Future Value of an Annuity\nIn the previous section, we addressed discounting a periodic stream of payments from the future to the\npresent. We are also interested in how to project the future value of a series of payments. In this case, an\ninvestment may be made periodically. Keeping with the definition of an annuity, if the amount of periodic\ninvestment is always the same, we may take a one-step shortcut to calculate the future value of that stream by\nusing the formula presented below:\nwhere FVa is the future value of the annuity, PYMT is a one-time payment or receipt in the series, r is the\ninterest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nAs we did in our section on present values of annuities, we will begin with an ordinary annuity and then\nproceed to an annuity due.",

It’s common for a term loan to be backed by collateral, such as the asset\nitself or other assets of the business.\n•\nRevolving lines of credit (revolvers), are used to finance the short-term working capital needs of a\nbusiness. Revolvers will have a specific maximum but no set schedule of monthly payments. Interest\naccrues on the amount of cash that a company has drawn down from the facility.

These are available on the basis of personal credit scores, with data\nbeing supplied by the three best-known credit reporting firms: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.\nIndividuals should check their scores with each of these companies at least once per year, which they can\ndo for no charge. Additional requests from the same company require a small fee.\n•\nAn unsecured personal loan is an installment loan, initially drawn for a fixed amount and repaid on a\nperiodic schedule with interest, as we have seen in our annuity examples. Unsecured means that the loan\nis not secured by collateral but is instead based on the strong credit history of the borrower.\n•\nIn contrast, a secured personal loan has an asset backing up the unpaid amount, and if the consumer\ndefaults on the debt, the asset can be seized by the lender to satisfy their claim. A common example is an\nauto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the\nborrower’s car being repossessed.\n•\nA mortgage loan is another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even\n30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the\nborrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance\nremains on the debt.\n•\nStudent loans are borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a\nfinancial institution or the federal government. Interest rates on these loans are generally low and\nadvantageous, and repayment does not begin until after the borrower’s education is complete (or if they\ndrop below a certain level of time status, such as becoming a half-time student).\nCalculating Loan Payments Using Simple Amortization\nLoan amortization refers to a schedule of how and when a debt will be repaid with interest. As noted, we will\nfocus on fixed-rate debts, such as auto loans, personal loans with installment payments, or mortgages. Before\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into\nbusiness or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area of Time Value of Money I.\nWe’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a\nmonthly basis. Fortunately, our formulas are easily adjusted from annual to non-annual periods. You will recall\nthat we solve for non-annual periods in the same way, with two adjustments: (1) we divide the annual interest\nrate by the number of periods in the year, and (2) we multiply the time periods by the number of those periods\nwithin a year. Therefore, in the case of monthly debt service, including interest and principal, we use 12\nperiods.\nGiven a three-year car loan at 6%, rather than using 6% and 3 periods in our formula, we would instead use\n0.5% (6% ÷ 12) and 36 periods (3 years × 12), and then apply the present value of an annuity formula in the\nsame way. Let’s say the three-year, 6% auto loan is for $32,000. You need to know if you can squeeze the\nmonthly payment into your budget. For our examples, we will ignore any other charges, fees, taxes, or extras\nthat your lender might include in these payments, and we will focus only on interest and principal repayment.\n240\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nYou will make the first payment one month from now, making this an ordinary annuity.

The length of the loan, coupled with the frequent compounding,\nemphasizes this. In month 10, the interest and principal amounts “pass” each other, and now the loan balance\nis dropping at a quicker rate. Finally, note that you will pay more than $56,000 to finance this $140,000\nborrowing. If you pay off this mortgage over 240 months as planned, the interest cost represents an additional\n28% of the full cost of the home!\nIf the borrower has the means to make an accelerated payment against this debt—for example, due to a\nbonus or other windfall—doing so can make a significant difference in the total cost of financing over the life\nof the loan. Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore\nthis bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to\ncompound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (see Table 8.6).\nMonth Interest Balance\n1,000.00\n1\n15.00 1,015.00\n2\n15.23 1,030.23\n3\n15.45 1,045.69\n4\n15.69 1,061.36\n5\n15.92 1.077.28\n6\n16.16 1,093.44\n7\n16.40 1,109.84\n8\n16.65 1,126.49\n9\n16.90 1,143.39\n10\n17.15 1,160.54\n11\n17.41 1,177.95\n12\n17.67 1,195.62\nTable 8.6 Compounded\nInterest on a Credit Card\nStatement ($)\nBecause interest compounds monthly rather than annually, the effective annual rate is 19.56%, not the\nintuitive rate of the stated 1.5% times 12 months, or 18%. Our basic compounding formula of (1+i)^n by\nsubstitution shows:\nTo isolate the effective annual rate, we then deduct 1 because our interest calculations are based on the value\nof $1:\nTherefore, it falls to the consumer/borrower to understand the true cost of borrowing, especially when larger\ndollar amounts are involved.

This section will explore examples of both,\nbeginning with financial calculators. While understanding and mastery of the use of time value of money\nequations are part of a solid foundation in the study of business and personal finance, calculators are rapid\nand efficient.\nWe’ll begin with the constant perpetuity that we used to illustrate the constant perpetuity formula. A share of\npreferred stock of Shaw Inc., pays an annual $2.00 dividend, and the required rate of return that investors in\nthis stock expect is 7%. The simple technique to solve this problem using the calculator is shown in Table 8.7.\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults 2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER RST\n0.00\n2\nEnter formula\n2 ÷ 7 % =\n28.57\nTable 8.7 Calculator Steps to Find the Required Rate of Return3\nEarlier we solved for the present value of a 5-year ordinary annuity of $25,000 earning 8% annually. We then\nsolved for an annuity due, all other facts remaining the same. The two solutions were $99,817.50 and\n$107,802.50, respectively.

In addition, we follow the payment amount of $25,000 with the +/-\nkeystroke—an optional step to see the final present value result as a positive value.\nTo perform the same calculation as an annuity due, we can perform the same procedures as above, but with\ntwo additional steps after Step 1 to change the default from payments at the end of each period to payments\nat the beginning of each period (see Table 8.9).\n3\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n246\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults\n2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER\nRST\n0.00\n2\nChange default to payment at end of period 2ND\n2ND [BGN] 2ND\n2ND [SET] BGN\n0.00\n3\nReturn to calculator mode\n2ND\n2ND [QUIT]\n0.00\n4\nEnter number of payments\n5 NN\nN =\n5.00\n5\nEnter interest rate per payment period\n8 I/Y\nI/Y\nI/Y =\n8.00\n6\nEnter payment amount\n25000 +/- PMT\n+/- PMT\nPMT = -25,000.00\n7\nCompute present value\nCPT PV\nCPT PV\nPV =\n107,803.17\nTable 8.9 Calculator Steps to Solve for an Annuity Due\nThe procedures to find future values of both ordinary annuities and annuities due are comparable to the two\nprocedures above.

One simple way to prove this is by using the calculator keystrokes listed in Table\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n247\n8.12.\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults\n2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER\nRST\n0.00\n2\nSet the display to four decimal places 2ND\n2ND [FORMAT] 4 ENTER\n4 ENTER DEC = 4.0000\n3\nReturn to calculator mode\n2ND\n2ND [QUIT]\n0.0000\n4\nEnter (1 + the monthly interest rate)\n1.015 YYXX\n1.0150\n5\nEnter the number of months\n12 YYXX\n1.1956\nTable 8.12 Calculator Steps to Prove the Actual Rate of Interest per Year\nHad we assumed that the stated monthly interest rate of 1.5% could be simply multiplied by 12 months for an\nannual rate of 18%, we would be ignoring the effect of more frequent compounding. As indicated above, the\nannual interest on the money that we spent initially, accumulating at a rate of 1.5% per month, is 19.56%, not\n18%:\nThe final example in this chapter will represent the amortization of a loan. Using a 36-month auto loan for\n$32,000 at 6% per year compounded monthly, we can easily find the monthly payment and the amortization of\nthis loan on our calculator using the following procedures and keystrokes.\nFirst, we find the monthly payment (see Table 8.13).\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSet all variables to defaults\n2ND\n2ND [RESET] ENTER\nENTER RST\n0.00\n2\nSet payments per year to 12\n2ND\n2ND [P/Y] 12 ENTER\nENTER P/Y =\n12.00\n3\nReturn to calculator mode\n2ND\n2ND [QUIT]\n0.00\n4\nEnter number of payments with the payment multiplier 3 2ND\n2ND [xP/Y] NN\nN =\n36.00\n5\nEnter annual interest rate\n6 I/Y\nI/Y\nI/Y =\n6.00\n6\nEnter loan amount\n32000 PV\nPV\nPV =\n32,000.00\n7\nCompute the monthly payment\nCPT\nCPT PMT\nPMT\nPMT =\n-973.50\nTable 8.13 Calculator Steps to Find the Monthly Payment of a Loan\nWe’ve verified the amount of our monthly debt service, including both the interest and repayment of the\nprincipal, as $973.50.

With some practice, a long table such as that can be constructed\nby even a relatively new user in less than 10 minutes.\nIn this section, we will illustrate how to use Excel to solve problems from earlier in the chapter, including\nperpetuities, ordinary annuities, effective interest rates, and loan amortization. We will omit the basic\ndynamics of an Excel spreadsheet because they were presented sufficiently in preceding chapters.\nRevisiting the constant perpetuity from Section 8.1, in which our shares of Shaw Inc., preferred stock pay an\nannual fixed dividend of $2.00 and the required rate of return is 7%, we do not use an Excel function for this\nsimple operation. The two values are entered in cells B3 and B4, respectively.\nWe enter a formula in cell B6 to perform the division and display the result in that cell. The actual contents of\ncell B6 are typed below it for your reference, in cell B8 (see Figure 8.2).\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n249\nFigure 8.2 Excel Spreadsheet for Valuing a Perpetuity\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file_Chapter08_finance) containing\nkey Chapter 8 Excel exhibits.\nTo find the present value of an ordinary annuity, we revisit Section 8.2.1. You will draw $25,000 at the end of\neach year for five years from a fund earning 8% annually, and you want to know how much you need in that\nfund today to accomplish this. We accomplish this in Excel easily with the PV function. The format of the PV\ncommand is\n=PV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nOnly the first three arguments inside the parentheses are used. We’ll place them in cells and refer to those\ncells in our PV function. As an option, you could also type the numbers into the parentheses directly. Notice\nthe slight rounding error because of decimal expansion. Also, the payment must be entered as a negative\nnumber for your result to be positive; this can be accomplished either by making the $25,000 in cell B5 a\nnegative amount or by placing a minus sign in front of the B5 in the formula’s arguments. In cell B3, you must\nenter the percent either as 0.08 or as 8% (with the percent sign). We repeated the formula syntax and the\nactual formula inputs in column A near the result, for your reference (see Figure 8.3).\nFigure 8.3 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nWe also found the present value of an annuity due. We use the same information from the ordinary annuity\nproblem above, but you will recall that the first of five payments happens immediately at the start of year 1,\nnot at the end. We follow the same procedures and inputs as in the previous example, but with one change to\nthe PV function: the last argument in the parentheses will change from 0 to 1. This is a toggle switch that\ncommands the PV function to treat this as an annuity due instead of an ordinary annuity (see Figure 8.4).\n250\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.4 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nSection 8.2 introduced us to future values. Comparable to the PV function above, Excel provides the FV\nfunction. Using the same information—$3,000 invested annually for five years, starting one year from now, at\n4%—we’ll solve using Excel (see Figure 8.5). The format of the command is\n=FV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nFigure 8.5 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nAs with present values, using the same data but solving for an annuity due requires the fifth argument inside\nthe parentheses to be changed from 0 to 1; all other values remain the same (see Figure 8.6).\nFigure 8.6 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Annuity Due\nIn Section 8.4, we explained the difference between stated and effective rates of interest to show the true cost\nof borrowing, in this case for a one-year period, if interest is compounded for periods within a year.

We will begin with a\npersonal example. You win a cash windfall through your state’s lottery. You would like to take a portion of the\nfunds and place them in a fixed investment so that you can draw $17,000 per year starting one year from now\nand continue to do so for the next two years. At the end of year 4, you want to withdraw $17,500, and at the\nend of year 5, you will withdraw the last $18,000 to close the account. When you take your last payment of\n$18,000, your fund will be totally depleted. You will always be earning 6% annually. How much of your cash\nwindfall should you set aside today to accomplish this?\nLet us break down the problem, remembering that we are thinking in reverse from the earlier problems that\ninvolved future values. In this case, we’re bringing future values back in time to find their present values. You\nwill recall that this process is called discounting rather than compounding.\nRegardless of how we solve this, the question remains the same: How much money must we invest today\n(present value) to achieve this? And remember that we will always be earning 6% compounded annually on\nany invested balances.\n9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows\n267\nWe are calculating present values as we did in previous chapters, given a known future value “target,” in order\nto determine how much money you need today to achieve that goal. Let us break this down by first reviewing\nthe relevant equations from previous chapters.\nPresent value of an ordinary annuity:\nPresent value of a single amount:\nwhere PVa is the present value of an annuity, PYMT is one payment in a consistent stream (an annuity), i is the\ninterest rate (annual unless otherwise specified), n is the number of periods, PV is the present value of a single\namount, and FV is the future value of a single amount.\nYou want to find out how much money you need to set aside today to accomplish your goal. You can also find\nout how much money you need to set aside in each period to accomplish this goal. Therefore, we can address\nthis problem in increments. Let us look at potential solutions.\nFirst, we will break this down into the cash flows of each year. Table 9.5 shows the timing of the future cash\nflows you’re expecting:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nExpected Amount to Be Withdrawn at End of Year $0.00 $17,000 $17,000 $17,000 $17,500 $18,000\nTable 9.5\nOne method is to take each year’s cash flows, which happen at the end of the year, and discount them to\ntoday using the present value formula for a single amount:\nBecause year 1’s withdrawal from your fund only has one year to earn interest, we discounted it for one year.\nThe second amount is discounted for two years:\nThe next three years are discounted in the same way, for three, four, and five years, respectively:\nNotice how we reverse our thinking on the exponent n from our approach to future value. This time, it\nincreases each period because we discount each future amount for a longer period to arrive at the value in\ntoday’s dollars.\nWhen we add all five discounted present value amounts from above, we derive today’s value of $72,753.49.\nExpressed more simply, if you wanted to extract the specified stream of cash flows at the end of each year\n268\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n($17,000 for three years, then $17,500, then $18,000), you would have to begin with $72,753.49. The thing to\nremember is that any amounts remaining in this fund, regardless of how you deplete it, will always be earning\n6% annually. See Table 9.6.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nWithdrawn at End of Year\n$17,000.00 $17,000.00 $17,000.00 $17,500.00 $18,000.00\nInterest on Balance\n$4,365.21\n$3,607.12\n$2,803.55\n$1,951.76\n$1,018.87\nRemaining Balance\n$72,753.49 $60,118.70 $46,725.82 $32,529.37 $16,981.13\n$0.00\nTable 9.6\nLet us try another approach. Because the amount of cash withdrawn in the first three years remains constant\nat $17,000, it can be viewed as an annuity—specifically, a three-period annuity of $17,000 and two single\npayments of $17,500 and $18,000. Therefore, we could also discount (bring to present value) an annuity of\n$17,000 for three years (the first three) and then combine it with the year 4 discounted amount and the year 5\ndiscounted amount. We can try it using the formulas for PVa and PVused above. In Step 1, we will discount the\nfirst three years as an annuity (ordinary, as the first withdrawal is not made until one year from now); in Step 2,\nwe will discount the year 4 single payment amount; and in Step 3, we will do the same for the year 5 single\npayment amount. Then we can add them together.\nStep 1: Find the present value of the annuity using the PVa formula:\nStep 2: Discount the year 4 amount using the formula for the present value of a single amount:\nStep 3: Perform the same operation as in Step 2 for the year 5 amount:",

When the author of this chapter would purchase a large machine, it\nwould likely take several years for that machine to justify its purchase with the revenues it would generate.\nThis is one of the primary reasons that accountants require us to depreciate the cost of an asset over time: to\nassess the cost against the time it will take for that asset to produce profits and cash flow.\n9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows\n269\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nPresent Value of a Mixed Stream\nAssume that you decide to invest $450,000. All cash flows are discounted at 4%. You are told by your\nfinancial advisor to expect cash inflows from your investment of $100,000 in year 1, $125,000 in year 2,\n$175,000 in year 3, $90,000 in year 4, and $50,000 in year 5. Would you agree to this plan based only on the\nnumbers? Each amount will be withdrawn at the end of every year, and interest will be compounded\nannually.\nSolution:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nExpected Amount to Be Withdrawn at End of Year $0.00 $100,000 $125,000 $175,000 $90,000 $50,000\nTable 9.7\nApplying the formula for the present value of a single amount, we discount each amount and then add the\ndiscounted amounts. We will simplify this approach with Excel shortly, but we must understand the\nreasoning behind discounting uneven cash flow streams with a direct solution.\nBy combining the five discounted amounts above, we get a total present value of $485,326.48. This amount\nrepresents the value today of the five expected cash inflows for as long as our remaining balance is earning\n4%.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThoughts on Cash Flow from Irina Simmons\nIn 2013, the author interviewed Irina Simmons, senior vice president, chief risk officer, and former treasurer\nof EMC Corporation. The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\nhigher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\nventures?\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.",

These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk.

Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGovernment Bonds\nReview this introductory video (https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices) about government bonds.\nMunicipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors. Though the global fixed-income debt\nmarket remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond\nmarkets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some\nexperts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only\n(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.\nThe chart in Figure 10.2 provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own\nconclusions about these markets.\nFigure 10.2 Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020 (data source: Nasdaq)\nWhile the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past\nseveral years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.",

The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the\ninterest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s\nfuture cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.\nAs we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the\ncurrent price if the investor holds the bond to maturity.\nYield to Maturity\nAs noted above, the market sets this discount rate, or the yield to maturity. The YTM reflects the going rate in\nthe bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.\nHence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market\ndetermines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other\navailable financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and\ndefault specific to the issued bond.\nThe YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity. How do we determine the bond’s YTM? We\ncan use our same three trusty methods: equations, a financial calculator, and Microsoft Excel (as shown at the\nend of the chapter).\n2\nAdam Hayes. “What Do Constantly Low Bond Yields Mean for the Stock Market?” Investopedia.

We call this kind of bond a premium bond.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate is less than the YTM, the bond sells at a discounted amount, or less than its par\nvalue. We refer to such a bond as a discount bond.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate and YTM are identical, a bond will sell at its par value. Bonds that experience this\nscenario in the market are referred to as par value bonds.\nThe interest or coupon payments of a bond are determined by its coupon rate and are calculated by\nmultiplying the face value of the bond by this coupon rate.\nThe inverse relationship of interest rates and bond prices is an important concept for investors to know.\nBecause interest rates fluctuate and can change significantly over time, it is important to understand how\nthese changes will impact bond values.\n10.3\nUsing the Yield Curve\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nUse the yield curve to show the term structure of interest rates.\n•\nDescribe and define changes in the yield curve shape.\n•\nExplain the importance of the yield curve shape.\n296\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTerm Structure of Interest Rates\nThe expected yields of various bonds across different maturity periods are referred to as the term structure of\ninterest rates. This is because they represent interest rates for different periods of time, maturities, or terms.\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called a yield curve. Essentially, the yield curve is a result of this plotting\nprocess and becomes a graphical representation of the term structure of interest rates. A yield curve will\nalways be constructed by showing the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or time periods on\nthe x-axis (see Figure 10.5).\nTo create a useful graph of the yield curve, interest rate yields should be computed for all government bonds\nat all remaining times to maturity. For example, the yields on all government bonds with a single year\nremaining until maturity should be calculated. This value is then plotted on the y-axis against the one-year\nterm on the x-axis. Similarly, yields on government bonds with two years remaining until maturity are\ncalculated and plotted on the y-axis against two years on the x-axis, and so on, until a point of critical mass of\ninformation is reached and the resulting graph displays useful information.\nThe yield curve for government bonds is also known as the risk-free yield curve because these securities are\nthought of as safe investments that are not expected to fail or default and will in all likelihood repay or\notherwise meet all financial obligations made through the bond issuance.\nFigure 10.5 A Normal Yield Curve: Long-Term Rates Are Higher Than Short-Term Rates\nA normal yield curve slopes upward, with yield increasing as the term increases. This is because yields on\nfixed-income investments such as bonds will rise as maturity periods increase and produce greater levels of\nrisk.\nCorporate issuers of bonds will usually offer bond issues at higher yields that the government, which is\nunderstandable because they are potentially riskier for investors. Government securities are guaranteed by\ngovernments and have little to no chance of default or nonpayment. This is not the case for corporate bonds,\nwhere there is always a chance of default, though the likelihood of this occurring will vary by individual",

            "chunk": "As we touched on earlier, bonds are fixed-income investments, and because of this, they are subject to a\nnumber of risks that could have negative effects on their market value. The most common and best-known\nrisks are interest rate risk and default risk, but other risks exist that should be understood. Among these\nrisks are the following:\n•\nCredit risk. If investors believe that a bond issuer is unlikely to meet its payment commitments, they may\ndemand a higher yield to purchase the bond issue in the first place. Due to the relative stability of\ngovernments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.\n•\nLiquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\n•\nDuration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n301\n•\nCall risk and reinvestment risk. Call risk is the risk of bonds being redeemed or called by the issuing\nfirm before their maturity dates. Corporations may elect to call a bond issue (provided the bond issue has\na call feature) when interest rates drop and companies are in a position to save a great deal of money by\nissuing new bonds with lower coupon rates. To investors, this is a risk in and of itself, but call risk also has\nthe effect of potentially causing reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is defined as the risk to investors\nwhen they find themselves facing unfavorable alternatives for investing the proceeds from their called\nbonds in new, lower-paying investments. This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\noriginal bond investors.\n•\nTerm risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues. We will\ndiscuss these bond ratings and the companies that issue them next.\nBond Ratings and Rating Providers\nIt is important for investors to know the risks they are assuming when investing in bonds. Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.",

Additionally, Enron’s unscrupulous business practices included\nrevenue misstatements and other questionable accounting practices to indicate favorable financial\nperformance. On top of this, some of Enron’s speculative business ventures proved to be disastrous,\nresulting in substantial financial losses.\nInitial allegations against Enron also focused on the role of their public accountants, Arthur Andersen.\nAndersen was one of the Big Five accounting firms in the United States at that time and had served as\nEnron’s auditing firm for over 16 years. According to court documents, Enron and Arthur Andersen had\nimproperly categorized hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions as increases to the company’s\nshareholder equity. It was also later discovered that Andersen failed to follow generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) when considering Enron’s dealings with related partnerships. As a result,\nEnron was able to conceal some of its losses from the investing public. After investigation by the United\nStates Justice Department, the firm was indicted on obstruction of justice charges in March 2002. The\ncombination of all of these irregularities and issues resulted in the December 2, 2001, bankruptcy of the\ncorporation.7 It was later determined that the majority of these unethical issues had been perpetuated with\nthe indirect knowledge or even, in some cases, by the direct actions of the board of directors or senior\noperational management of the company.\nSpecifics and Enron’s Bond Ratings\nOn October 27, 2001, the company began buying back all its commercial paper, valued at around $3.3\nbillion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron’s supply of cash. On November 8, Enron announced\nthat restatements to its financial statements for the years 1997–2000 were necessary to correct several\naccounting violations. However, by November 28, 2001, credit rating agencies had reduced Enron’s bond\nrating to junk status.8\nOther Examples of Significant Bond Ratings Downgrades\nSome companies that have recently experienced downgrades (or potential downgrades) to their credit and\nbond ratings include Delta Airlines, Ford, Occidental Petroleum, Carnival Cruises, and T-Mobil. Some of\nthese businesses, such as Delta and Carnival, are suffering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the\nhope is that they don’t experience the same disastrous fate as Enron.\n(sources: www.britannica.com/event/Enron-scandal; www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2002/apr/\ntheriseandfallofenron.html; corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/enron-scandal/;\nwww.wsj.com/articles/corporate-bond-downgrades-grow-as-coronavirus-spreads-11585849497)\nConcepts of Bond Returns\nBond investors earn profits through two different means: collecting interest income and generating capital\ngains. These are important concepts for any investor who considers putting their money in fixed-income\nsecurities such as bonds.\n7\nDouglas O. Linder. “Enron (Lay & Skilling) Trial (2006).” Famous Trials.

The coupon rate of a\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor\npurchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive\n20 coupon payments equal to\nor\nfor a total of $1,000.\nDepending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation\nresulting in significant realized return for the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could",

However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by\ncompanies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate\nincome and eventual value for individual investors.\nWith common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will\nreceive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•\nStocks are a liquid form of investment and can be bought or sold within secondary markets relatively\neasily.\n•\nInformation about companies, markets, and important trends are widely published and readily available\nto the investing public.\nThese advantages are significant and lead many individuals to move into stock investments.

The first method, calculating the\nchange in dividend each year and then averaging these changes, is the arithmetic approach. The second\nmethod, using the first and last dividends only, is the geometric approach. The arithmetic approach is\nequivalent to a simple interest approach, and the geometric approach is equivalent to a compound interest\napproach.\nTo apply our PV formula above, we had to assume that the company would pay dividends forever and that we\nwould hold on to our stock forever. If we assume that we will sell the stock at some point in the future,\nhowever, can we use this formula to estimate the value of a stock held for a finite period of time? The answer\nis a qualified yes. We can adjust this model for a finite horizon to estimate the present value of the dividend\nstream that we will receive while holding the stock. We will still have a problem estimating the stock’s selling\nprice at the end of this finite dividend stream, and we will address this issue shortly. For the finite growing\ndividend stream, we adjust the infinite stream in our earlier equation to the following:\nwhere n is the number of future dividends.\nThis equation may look very complicated, but just focus on the far right part of the model. This part calculates\nthe percentage of the finite dividend stream that you will receive if you sell the stock at the end of the nth year.\nSay you will sell Johnson & Johnson after 10 years. What percentage of the $60.23 (the finite dividend stream)\nwill you get? Begin with the following:\n338\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNow, multiply the result by the price for your portion of the infinite stream:\nThe next step is to discount the selling price of Johnson & Johnson in 10 years at 17% and then add the two\nvalues to get the stock’s price. So, how do we estimate the stock’s price at the end of 10 years? If we elect to\nsell the stock after 10 years and the company will continue to pay dividends at the same growth rate, what\nwould a buyer be willing to pay? How could we estimate the selling price (value) of the stock at that time?\nWe need to estimate the dividend in 10 years and assume a growth rate and the required return of the new\nowner at that point in time. Let’s assume that the new owner also wants a 17% return and that the dividend\ngrowth rate will remain at 13.04%. We calculate the dividend in 10 years by taking the current growth rate plus\none raised to the tenth power times the current dividend:\nWe then use the dividend growth model with infinite horizon to determine the price in 10 years as follows:\nYour price for the stock today—given that you will receive the growing dividend stream for 10 years and sell\nfor $258.10 in 10 years, and also given that you want a 17% return over the 10 years—is as shown below:\nWhy did you get the same price of $60.23 for your stock with both the infinite growth model and the finite\nmodel? The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model\nwith a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales\nof the stock.",

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. Examples of such companies include Facebook, Amazon,\nGoogle, Biogen, and Monster Beverage. The DCF model differs from the dividend discount models we covered\nearlier, as DDM methodologies are almost entirely based on a stock’s periodic dividends.\nThe DCF model is an absolute valuation model, meaning that it does not involve comparisons with other firms\nwithin any specific industry but instead uses objective data to evaluate a company on a stand-alone basis. The\nDCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows, determining the present value of the entire organization and\nthen working this down to the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\nThis highly regarded methodology is the evaluation tool of choice for experienced financial analysts when\nevaluating companies and their common stock. Many analysts prefer DCF methods of valuation because these\nare based on a company’s cash flows, which are far less easily manipulated through accounting treatments\nthan revenues or bottom-line earnings.\nThe DCF model formula in its mathematical form is presented below:\nwhere CF1 is the estimated cash flow in year 1, CF2 is the estimated cash flow in year 2, and so on; TCF is the\nterminal cash flow, or expected cash flow from the ending asset sale; r is the discount rate or required rate of\nreturn; g is the anticipated growth rate of the cash flow; and n is the number of years covered in the model.\nApplying the DCF Model\nWe can apply the DCF model to an example to demonstrate this methodology and how the formula works.\nCalculate the value of Mayweather Inc. and its common stock based on the next six years of cash flow results.\nAssume that the discount rate (required rate of return) is 8%, Mayweather’s growth rate is 3%, and the\nterminal value (TCF) will be two and one-half times the discounted value of the cash flow in year 6.\n11.3 • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\n341\nMayweather has a cash flow of $2.0 million in year 1, so its discounted cash flow after one year (CF1) is\n$1,851,851.85. We arrive at this amount by applying the discount rate of 8% for a one-year period to determine\nthe present value.\nIn subsequent years, Mayweather’s cash flow will be increasing by 3%. These future cash flows also must be\ndiscounted back to present values at an 8% rate, so the discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years\nwill be as follows:\nOur earlier assumption that the terminal value will be 2.5 times the value in the sixth year gives us a total\nterminal cash flow (TCF) of\n, or $3,652,697. Now, if we take all these future discounted cash\nflows and add them together, we arrive at a grand total of $13,554,477. So, based on our DCF model analysis,\nthe total value of Mayweather Inc. is just over $13.5 million.\nAt this point, we have the estimated value of the entire company, but we need to work this down to the level of\nper-share value of common stock.\nLet’s say that Mayweather is currently trading at $12 per share, and it has 1,000,000 common shares\noutstanding. This tells us that the market capitalization of the company is\n, or $12 million,\nand that a $12 share price may be considered relatively low. The reason for this is that based on our DCF",

The most evaluative ratios that can\nbe computed from a company’s financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to book (P/B),\nprice-to-sales (P/S), and price-to cash-flow (P/CF) ratios.\n11.2 Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\nThe dividend discount model, or DDM, is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is\nthe present value of all of its future dividends. The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders.

T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\n354\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-\nexempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid\nsecurities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable. MMMFs provide smaller firms and investors the\nopportunity to participate in the money market by facilitating smaller individual investment amounts.\nFinancial Instrument Typical Maturity Minimum Amount\nIssuer\nTreasury bills\n4–52 weeks\n$10,000\nFederal government\nCommercial paper\n270 days\n$100,000\nBusinesses\nNegotiable CDs\n6 months\n$100,000\nFinancial institutions\nMMMFs\nInvestment companies\nFederal funds\n1 day\n$1 million\nFinancial institutions\nTable 12.1 Money Market Instrument Characteristics (Selected)\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets the equilibrium interest rate\non federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools.

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. Financial institutions such as banks are required to keep a\nfraction of their deposits on reserve with the Fed. When banks find they are short of reserves and immediately\nneed cash to meet reserve requirements, they can borrow directly from the Fed through the so-called\n“discount window” or purchase excess reserves from other banks in the federal funds market. Often, the\nmaturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market\nnegotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate\nrange in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market.\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the activities and functioning of the federal funds market has changed. The\nfederal funds rate is still the rate targeted by the Fed for monetary policy, but the participants have evolved for\nseveral reasons. The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the\nFederal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not\nrequired to keep reserves with the Fed. In addition, the Fed now pays interest to commercial banks for\nreserves held at the Federal Reserve banks. Paying interest on reserves reduces the incentive for domestic\ncommercial banks to enter the federal funds market since they can already earn interest on their excess\nreserves.\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n355\nDaily trading volume in the federal funds market from 2016 through 2020 ranged from a high of $115 billion in\nMarch of 2018 to a low of only $34 billion on December 31, 2020.2 The volume of federal funds activity is lower\nin periods of slower economic growth because banks have fewer good opportunities to issue loans and are\nless likely to be short of required reserves.\nBond Markets\nBond markets are financial markets that make payments to investors for a specific period of time. Investors\ndecide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expect inflation to affect the value of the\nfixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\nGovernment Bond Markets\nIn the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities\nin the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.\nWe learned in Bonds and Bond Valuation that the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to\nraise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,\nas the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.\nThe debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online at https://www.usdebtclock.org/\n(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).\nTreasury notes (T-notes) are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The\nTreasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov\n(https://openstax.org/r/treasurydirect.gov) in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in\nthat they are longer term and pay semiannual coupon interest payments, as well as the par or face value of\nthe note at maturity. T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\nexplicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and",

Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for\ntrading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.\nWhen a corporation uses a real asset, such as property or buildings, to guarantee a bond, the firm has issued a\nmortgage bond. However, it is more common for a corporation to issue an unsecured bond known as a\ndebenture. The risk of a debenture reflects the risk of the entire corporation and does not rely on the value of\na specific underlying asset, as is the case with a mortgage bond.\nThe risk a bondholder bears for buying a bond depends in part on the terms of the bond indenture, market\nconditions over the life of the bond contract, and the ability or inability of the firm to generate sufficient cash\nflows to meet its bond obligations. Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\ncost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade\nbonds. This could limit the number of investors who can participate in the market for lower-grade bonds,\nthereby reducing the liquidity, price, and tradability of those debt securities.\nThere are only two US companies with AAA credit ratings: Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson.5 Over the past 40\nyears, there has been a steady decline of AAA-rated companies (from sixty in 1980). Many institutions have\nfound that this rating requires a more conservative approach to debt that can inhibit growth and revenue. So,\nin today’s market, credit ratings have begun to lose their importance. It seems that the ability to pay debts has\nbecome secondary to the potential for growth.\nFitch Moody’s S&P\nBond Grade/Risk\nAAA\nAaa\nAAA Investment/low risk\nAA\nAa\nAA Investment/low risk\nA\nA\nA\nInvestment/low risk\nTable 12.2 Credit Scale Ratings from the Three Credit\nRating Agencies\n4\nS&P Global Ratings. “Transparency Statement.” S&P Global Ratings. https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/about/transparency\n5\nThe Wall Street Insider. “Why Only Two Companies Are Left with the AAA Rating.” The Wall Street Insider.

For corporations, shares of stock\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the\ncash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.\nCorporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise\ncapital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners. There are generally\ntwo types of stock, preferred and common. Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and bonds.\nPreferred stock has a higher claim to cash flows than common stockholders have (thus the term preferred),\nbut it is lower than that of bondholders. In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of\nthe three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.\nCommon stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a\nclaim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have\nvoting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.\nOne popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or\nmarket cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The largest company by sales\nvolume in 2020 was Walmart.7\nGeographical Location of Exchanges\nOwnership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in an over-\nthe-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly\nadapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a\nbroker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors\nare always able to buy or sell their stocks. An OTC market is an electronic market conducted on computer\nscreens and consists of direct transactions among buyers and sellers, with no broker to bring the two\n6\nSiblis Research. “Total Market Value of US Stock Market.” Siblis Research. https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/;\nThe World Bank. “Market Capitalization of Listed Domestic Companies (current US$).” The World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/\nindicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD\n7\nCompanies Market Cap. “Largest American Companies by Market Capitalization.” Companies Market Cap.\nhttps://companiesmarketcap.com/usa/largest-companies-in-the-usa-by-market-cap/; National Retail Federation. “Top 100 Retailers\n2020 List.” National Retail Federation. 2020. https://nrf.com/resources/top-retailers/top-100-retailers/top-100-retailers-2020-list\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n359\ntogether.

When issuing new equity, the issuing firm receives the proceeds of the sale. Having an active\nsecondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired.\nMost of the trading of equity securities is for used securities on the secondary market.\nAn initial public offering, or IPO, occurs when a firm offers stock to the public for the first time. With a typical\nIPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The\ninvestment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue,\nand establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see\nFigure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of\nthe value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum\ncompany, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.8 The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at\nover $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese\ngovernment.9\nInstitutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Smaller investors\nrarely have the opportunity to purchase. However, any investor can buy the new shares once available for\npublic trading. Investment author and financial expert Professor Burton Malkiel cautions that buying IPOs\nimmediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs\nhave underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.10\nAnother way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through a seasoned equity offering\n(SEO). An IPO occurs when a firm transitions from a private to a public company. An SEO takes place when a\ncorporation that is already publicly traded issues additional shares of stock to the public. An SEO is often part\nof a SEC Rule 415 offering, or so-called shelf registration. Shelf registrations allow a company to register with\nthe SEC to issue new shares but wait up to two years before issuing the shares. This gives companies the\nability to register their intent to issue new shares and to “set them on the shelf” until market conditions are\nmost favorable for issuance to the public.\n8\nJennifer Rudden. “Largest IPOs Worldwide as of January 21, 2021.” Statista. 2021. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269343/\nworlds-largest-ipos/\n9\nDeborah D’Souza. “Ant Group Set to Be World’s Largest IPO Ever.” Investopedia.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and",

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks",

            "chunk": "other is common practice. The technical term is arithmetic mean, and average technically refers only to a\ncenter location. Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by\nmathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\nfor arithmetic mean.\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\nthen divide by the number of data values.\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data. Population\ndata represents all the outcomes or measurements that are of interest. Sample data represents outcomes or\nmeasurements collected from a subset, or part, of the population of interest.\nThe notation\nis used to indicate the sample mean, where the arithmetic mean is calculated based on data\ntaken from a sample. The notation\nis used to denote the sum of the data values, and\nis used to indicate\nthe number of data values in the sample, also known as the sample size.\nThe sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:\nFinance professionals often rely on averages of Treasury bill auction amounts to determine their value. Table\n13.1 lists the Treasury bill auction amounts for a sample of auctions from December 2020.\nMaturity\nAmount ($Billions)\n4-week T-bills\n$32.9\n8-week T-bills\n38.4\n13-week T-bills\n63.1\n26-week T-bills\n59.6\n52-week T-bills\n39.7\nTotal\n$233.7\nTable 13.1 United States Treasury Bill\nAuctions, December 22 and 24, 2020\n(source: Treasury Direct)\n382\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean of the amount paid for Treasury bills at auction, in billions of dollars, we use\nthe following formula:\nMedian\nTo determine the median of a data set, order the data from smallest to largest, and then find the middle value\nin the ordered data set. For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\nSolution:\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\n$5,000,000.\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\nset.\n13.1 • Measures of Center\n383\nMode\nAnother measure of center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one\nmode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data\nset with two modes is called bimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology\nstock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:\nTo find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this\ndata set is 72. It is helpful to know that the most common closing price of this particular stock over the past 20\nweeks has been $72.00.\nGeometric Mean",

The normal distribution is applicable when the frequency of data values decreases with each\nclass above and below the mean. The normal distribution can be applied to many examples from the finance\nindustry, including average returns for mutual funds over a certain time period, portfolio values, and others.\nThe normal distribution has two parameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,\n, and the\nstandard deviation,\n. The variable x represents the quantity being measured whose data values have a\n394\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnormal distribution.\nFigure 13.3 Graph of the Normal Distribution\nThe curve in Figure 13.3 is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean,\n. The mean is the same\nas the median, which is the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about\n. As the notation\nindicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. Because the area\nunder the curve must equal 1, a change in the standard deviation,\n, causes a change in the shape of the\nnormal curve; the curve becomes fatter and wider or skinnier and taller depending on\n. A change in\ncauses\nthe graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability\ndistributions.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the normal distribution, we find specific areas under the normal\ncurve, and this is further discussed in Apply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts. For example,\nsuppose that at a financial consulting company, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with a standard\ndeviation of $7,500. A normal curve can be drawn to represent this scenario, in which the mean of $60,000\nwould be plotted on the horizontal axis, corresponding to the peak of the curve. Then, to find the probability\nthat an employee earns more than $75,000, you would calculate the area under the normal curve to the right\nof the data value $75,000.\nExcel uses the following command to find the area under the normal curve to the left of a specified value:\n=NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE)\nFor example, at the financial consulting company mentioned above, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with\na standard deviation of $7,500. To find the probability that a random employee’s salary is less than $55,000\nusing Excel, this is the command you would use:\n=NORM.DIST(55000, 60000, 7500, TRUE)\nResult: 0.25249\nThus, there is a probability of about 25% that a random employee has a salary less than $55,000.\nExponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For\nexample, a finance professional might want to model the time to default on payments for company debt\nholders.\nAn exponential distribution is one in which there are fewer large values and more small values. For example,\nmarketing studies have shown that the amount of money customers spend in a store follows an exponential\ndistribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend large\namounts of money.\nExponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or the length of time a\nproduct lasts. The random variable for the exponential distribution is continuous and often measures a\n13.4 • Statistical Distributions\n395\npassage of time, although it can be used in other applications.

The mean time is given as\n45 seconds, which is the same as 0.75 minutes. The probability can then be calculated as follows:\n13.5\nProbability Distributions\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate portfolio weights in an investment.\n•\nCalculate and interpret the expected values.\n•\nApply the normal distribution to characterize average and standard deviation in financial contexts.\nCalculate Portfolio Weights\nIn many financial analyses, the weightings by asset category in a portfolio are a key index used to assess if\nthe portfolio is meeting allocation metrics. For example, an investor approaching retirement age may wish to\nshift assets in a portfolio to more conservative and lower-volatility investments. Weightings can be calculated\nin several different ways—for example, based on individual stocks in a portfolio or on various sectors in a\nportfolio. Weightings can also be calculated based on number of shares or the value of shares of a stock.\nTo calculate a weighting in a portfolio based on value, take the value of the particular investment and divide it\nby the total value of the overall portfolio. As an example, consider an individual’s retirement account for which\nthe desired portfolio weighting is determined to be 40% stocks, 50% bonds, and 10% cash equivalents. Table\n13.7 shows the current assets in the individual’s portfolio, broken out according to stocks, bonds, and cash\nequivalents.\n396\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAsset\nValue ($)\nStock A\n134,000\nStock B\n172,000\nBond C\n38,000\nBond D\n102,000\nBond E\n96,000\nCash in CDs\n35,700\nCash in savings\n22,500\nTotal Value\n600,200\nTable 13.7 Portfolio Assets in\nStocks, Bonds, and Cash\nEquivalents\nTo determine the weighting in this portfolio for stocks, bonds, and cash, take the total value for each category\nand divide it by the total value of the entire portfolio. These results are summarized in Table 13.8. Notice that\nthe portfolio weightings shown in the table do not match the target, or desired, allocation weightings of 40%\nstocks, 50% bonds, and 10% cash equivalents.\nAsset Category Category Value ($) Portfolio Weighting\nStocks\nBonds\nCash\nTotal Value\nTable 13.8 Portfolio Weightings for Stocks, Bonds, and Cash\nEquivalents\nPortfolio rebalancing is a process whereby the investor buys or sells assets to achieve the desired portfolio\nweightings. In this example, the investor could sell approximately 10% of the stock assets and purchase bonds\nwith the proceeds to align the asset categories to the desired portfolio weightings.\nCalculate and Interpret Expected Values\nA probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. For\nexample, we can assign a probability to the outcome of a certain stock increasing in value or decreasing in\nvalue. One application of a probability distribution function is determining expected value.\nIn many financial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. To calculate expected returns, we\nformulate a probability distribution and then use the following formula to calculate expected value:\nwhere P1, P2, P3, ⋯Pn are the probabilities of the various returns and R1, R2, R3, ⋯Rn are the various rates of\nreturn.\nIn essence, expected value is a weighted mean where the probabilities form the weights.

For example, we may be interested\nto know if there is a correlation between bond prices and interest rates or between the age of a car and the\nvalue of the car. To investigate the correlation between two numeric quantities, the first step is to create a\nscatter plot that will graph the (x, y) ordered pairs. The independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the\nx-variable, and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as the y-variable.\nFor example, we may be interested to know if the price of Nike stock is correlated with the value of the S&P 500\n(Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index). To investigate this, monthly data can be collected for Nike stock\nprices and value of the S&P 500 for a period of time, and a scatter plot can be created and examined. A scatter\nplot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two variables. The\nsetup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted\non the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted\non the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter\ndiagram. Table 14.1 shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year\ntime period.\nTo assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine\nif a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a\nnegative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent\nvariable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to\ndecrease (the two quantities move in the same direction). A negative correlation indicates that as the\nindependent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases, or, as the independent variable decreases,\nthe dependent variable increases (the two quantities move in opposite directions). If there is no relationship or\nassociation between the two quantities, where one quantity changing does not affect the other quantity, we\nconclude that there is no correlation between the two variables.\nDate\nS&P 500\nNike\nStock Price\n4/1/2020 2,912.43\n87.18\n5/1/2020 3,044.31\n98.58\n6/1/2020 3,100.29\n98.05\nTable 14.1 Nike Stock Price ($) and\nValue of S&P 500 over a One-Year\nTime Period (source: Yahoo!

When interest rates are at 5%, the company stock has a\nvalue of $94. Using the linear model, when interest rates are at 5%, the model predicts the value of the\ncompany stock to be $99. Calculate the residual for this data point.\nSolution:\nA residual is the difference between an observed y-value and the predicted y-value obtained from the linear\nregression equation\nThe goal in the regression analysis is to determine the coefficients a and b in the following regression\nequation:\nOnce the (x, y) has been collected, the slope (b) and y-intercept (a) can be calculated using the following\nformulas:\nwhere n refers to the number of data pairs and\nindicates sum of the x-values.\nNotice that the formula for the y-intercept requires the use of the slope result (b), and thus the slope should\nbe calculated first and the y-intercept should be calculated second.\nWhen making predictions for y, it is always important to plot a scatter diagram first. If the scatter plot indicates\nthat there is a linear relationship between the variables, then it is reasonable to use a best-fit line to make\npredictions for y, given x within the domain of x-values in the sample data, but not necessarily for x-values\noutside that domain.\nNote: Computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can quickly calculate the best-fit line\nand create the graphs. The calculations tend to be tedious if done by hand.\nAssumptions for Linear Regression\nTesting the significance of the correlation coefficient requires that certain assumptions about the data are\nsatisfied.

(Note: The discrepancy in the more precise Excel result\nand the formula result is due to rounding in interim calculations.)\nFigure 14.9 Revenue versus Advertising for Fortune 500 Company ($000s) Showing FORECAST Command in Excel\nA word of caution when predicting values for y: it is generally recommended to only predict values for y using\nvalues of x that are in the original range of the data collection.\nAs an example, assume we have developed a linear model to predict the height of male children based on\ntheir age. We have collected data for the age range from\nyears old to\nyears old, and we have\nconfirmed that the scatter plot shows a linear trend and that the correlation is significant.\nIt would be erroneous to use this model to predict the height of a 25-year-old male since\nis outside the\nrange of the x-data, which was from 3 to 10 years old. The reason this is not recommended is that a linear\npattern cannot be assumed to continue beyond the x-value of 10 years old unless some data collection has\noccurred at ages greater than 10 to confirm that the linear pattern is consistent for x-values beyond 10 years\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n435\nold.\nGenerating Prediction Intervals\nOne important value of an estimated regression equation is its ability to predict the effects on y of a change in\none or more values of the independent variables. The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure.

Investors are interested in both risk and return\nbecause understanding one without the other is really meaningless. In terms of investment, the concept of\nreturn is fairly straightforward; return is the benefit, or profit, the investor expects from an expenditure. It is\nthe reward for investing—the reason an investment is made in the first place. However, no investment is a\nsure thing. The return may not be what the investor was expecting. This uncertainty about what the return will\nbe is referred to as risk.\nWe begin by looking at how to measure both risk and return when considering an individual asset, such as one\nstock. If your grandparents bought 100 shares of Apple, Inc. stock for you when you were born, you are\ninterested in knowing how well that investment has done. You may even want to compare how that\ninvestment has fared to how an investment in a different stock, perhaps Disney, would have done. You are\ninterested in measuring the historical return.",

You are\ninterested in measuring the historical return.\nIndividual Investment Realized Return\nThe realized return of an investment is the total return that occurs over a particular time period. Suppose that\nyou purchased a share of Target (TGT) at the beginning of January 2020 for $128.74. At the end of the year, you\nsold the stock for $176.53, which was $47.79 more than you paid for it. This increase in value is known as a\ncapital gain. As the owner of the stock, you also received $2.68 in dividends during 2020. The total dollar return\nfrom your investment is calculated as\nIt is common to express investment returns in percentage terms rather than dollar terms. This allows you to\nanswer the question “How much do I receive for each dollar invested?” so that you can compare investments\nof different sizes. The total percent return from your investment is\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the dividends you received by the initial stock price. This\ncalculation says that for each dollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.0208 in dividends. The capital\ngain yield is the change in the stock price divided by the initial stock price. This calculation says that for each\ndollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.3712 in capital gains. Your total percent return of 39.20% means\nthat you made $0.392 for every dollar invested when your gains from both dividends and stock price\nappreciation are totaled together.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Return\nYou purchased 10 shares of 3M (MMM) stock in January 2020 for $175 per share, received dividends of $5.91\n450\n15 • How to Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nper share, and sold the stock at the end of the year for $169.72 per share.

You spent\nto purchase the stock, and you sold it for\nYour total\ndollar return is\nYour dividend yield is\n, or 3.38%, and your capital gain yield is\nor 3.02%.

Your\ncapital gain is negative, or what is often referred to as a capital loss. Although the price fell, you still had a\npositive total dollar return because of the dividend income.\nOf course, investors seldom purchase a stock and then sell it exactly one year later. Assume that you\npurchased shares of Facebook (FB) on June 1, 2020, for $228.50 per share and sold the shares three months\nlater for $261.90. You received no dividends. In this case, your holding period percentage return is calculated\nas\nThis 14.62% is your return for a three-month holding period. To compare them to other investment\nopportunities, you need to express returns on a per-year, or annualized, basis. The holding period returned is\nconverted to an effective annual rate (EAR) using the formula\nwhere m is the number of holding periods in a year.\nThere are four three-month periods in a year. So, the EAR for this investment is\nWhat happens if you own a stock for more than one year? Your holding period return would have occurred\nover a period longer than a year, but the process to calculate the EAR is the same.

This 22.4% is\ncalled the arithmetic average return.\nThe geometric average return will be smaller than the arithmetic average return (unless the returns for all\nyears are identical). This is due to the basic arithmetic of compounding. Think of a very simple example in\nwhich you invest $100 for two years. If you have a positive return of 50% the first year and a negative 50%\nreturn the second year, you will have an arithmetic average return of\n, but you will have a\ngeometric average return of\n. With a 50% positive return the\nfirst year, you ended the year with $150. The second year, you lost 50% of that balance and were left with only\n$75.\nAnother important fact when studying average returns is that the order in which you earn the returns is not\nimportant. Consider what would have occurred if the returns in the two years were reversed, so that you faced\na loss of 50% in the first year of your investment and a gain of 50% in the second year of your investment. With\na −50% return in the first year, you would have ended that year with only $50. Then, if that $50 earned a\npositive 50% return the second year, you would have a $75 balance at the end of the two-year period. A\nnegative return of 50% followed by a positive return of 50% still results in an arithmetic average return of 0%",

Finance)\nFigure 15.2 contains a graph of the returns for each of these four stocks by year. In this graph, it is easy to see\nthat DAL and LUV both have more volatility, or returns that vary more from year to year, than do XOM or CVS.\nThis higher volatility leads to DAL and LUV having higher standard deviations of returns than XOM or CVS.\nFigure 15.2 Yearly Returns for DAL, LUV, XOM, and CVS (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\nStandard deviation is considered a measure of the risk of owning a stock. The larger the standard deviation of\na stock’s annual returns, the further from the average that stock’s return is likely to be in any given year. In\nother words, the return for the stock is highly unpredictable. Although the return for CVS varies from year to\nyear, it is not subject to the wide swings of the returns for DAL or LUV.\nWhy are stock returns so volatile? The value of the stock of a company changes as the expectations of the\nfuture revenues and expenses of the company change. These expectations may change due to a number of\nevents and new information. Good news about a company will tend to result in an increase in the stock price.\nFor example, DAL announcing that it will be opening new routes and flying to cities it has not previously\nserviced suggests that DAL will have more customers and more revenue in future years. Or if CVS announces\nthat it has negotiated lower rent for many of its locations, investors will expect the expenses of the company to\nfall, leading to more profits. Those types of announcements will often be associated with a higher stock price.\nConversely, if the pilots and flight attendants for DAL negotiate higher salaries, the expenses for DAL will\nincrease, putting downward pressure on profits and the stock price.\n15.1 • Risk and Return to an Individual Asset\n457\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPeloton and Risk\nAn example of how news can impact the price of a stock occurred on May 5, 2021, when Peloton recalled all\nof its Tread+ and Tread products after the tragic death of a child and 70 injuries associated with use of its\nproducts.1 The previous day, Peloton stock traded for $96.70 per share.

Most investors, however, own\nshares of stock in multiple companies. This collection of stocks is known as a portfolio. Let’s explore why it is\nwise for investors to hold a portfolio of stocks rather than to pick just one favorite stock to own.\nWe saw that investors who owned DAL experienced an average annual return of 20.87% but also a large\nstandard deviation of 51.16%. Investors who used all their funds to purchase DAL stock did exceptionally well\nduring 2012–2014. But in 2020, those investors lost almost one-third of their money as COVID-19 caused a\nsharp reduction in air travel worldwide. To protect against these extreme outcomes, investors practice what is\ncalled diversification, or owning a variety of stocks in their portfolios.\nSuppose, for example, you have saved $50,000 that you want to invest. If you purchased $50,000 of DAL stock,\nyou would not be diversified. Your return would depend solely on the return on DAL stock. If, instead, you used\n$5,000 to purchase DAL stock and used the remaining $45,000 to purchase nine other stocks, you would be\ndiversifying. Your return would depend not only on DAL’s return but also on the returns of the other nine\nstocks in your portfolio. Investors practice diversification to manage risk.\nIt is akin to the saying “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” If you place all of your eggs in one basket\nand that basket breaks, all of your eggs will fall and crack. If you spread your eggs out across a number of\nbaskets, it is unlikely that all of the baskets will break and all of your eggs will crack. One basket may break,\nand you will lose the eggs in that basket, but you will still have your other eggs. The same idea holds true for\ninvesting. If you own stock in a company that does poorly, perhaps even goes out of business, you will lose the\nmoney you placed in that particular investment. However, with a diversified portfolio, you do not lose all your\nmoney because your money is spread out across a number of different companies.\n1\nTrefis Team and Great Speculations. “Is Peloton’s Tread+ Recall an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?” Forbes, May 7, 2021.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/05/07/is-pelotons-tread-recall-an-opportunity-to-buy-the-stock/\n2\nTomi Kilgore. “Peloton Stock Sinks to 8-Month Low after 125,000 Treadmills Recalled for ‘Risk of Injury or Death.’” MarketWatch.\nMay 6, 2021. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/peloton-stock-sinks-toward-9-month-low-after-125-000-treadmills-recalled-for-\nrisk-of-injury-or-death-11620233715\n458\n15 • How to Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDiversification\nFidelity Investments Inc. is a multinational financial services firm and one of the largest asset managers in\nthe world.

At the same time, you would like to invest the money and have it grow until\nyou are ready to start law school.\nAlthough you would like to earn a return on the money so that you have more than $20,000 by the time you\nstart law school, your primary objective is to keep the money safe. You are looking for a risk-free investment.\nLending money to the US government is considered the lowest-risk investment that you can make. You can\npurchase a US Treasury security. The chances of the US government not paying its debts is close to zero.\nAlthough, in theory, no investment is 100% risk-free, investing in US government securities is generally\nconsidered a risk-free investment because the risk is so miniscule.\n4\nMeir Statman. “How Many Stocks Make a Diversified Portfolio?” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 22, no. 3\n(September 1987): 353–363. https://doi.org/10.2307/2330969\n15.3 • The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n461\nThe rate that you can earn by purchasing US Treasury securities is a proxy for the risk-free rate. It is used as\nan investing benchmark. The average rate of return for the three-month US Treasury security from 1928 to\n2020 is 3.36%.5 You can see that you will not become immensely wealthy by investing in US Treasury bills.\nAnother characteristic of US Treasury securities, however, is that their volatility tends to be much lower than\nthat of stocks. In fact, the standard deviation of returns for the US Treasury bills is 3.0%. Unlike the returns for\nstocks, the return on US Treasury bills has never been negative. The lowest annual return was 0.03%, which\noccurred in 2014.6\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUS Treasury Securities\nVisit the website of the US Department of the Treasury (https://openstax.org/r/home.treasury) to learn\nmore about US Treasury securities. You will find current interest rates for both short-term securities (US\nTreasury bills) and long-term securities (US Treasury bonds).\nRisk Premium\nYou know that if you use your $20,000 to invest in stock rather than in US Treasury bills, the outcome of the\ninvestment will be uncertain. Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will\nonly be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to\ntake the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make\ninvesting in US Treasury securities.\nFrom 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher\nthan the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.7 Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,\nhowever, have also been much more volatile. In fact, there were 25 years in which the return for the S&P 500\nindex was negative.\nYou may not be willing to take the risk of losing some of the money your grandparents gave you because you\nhave been setting it aside for law school. If that’s the case, you will want to invest in US Treasury securities.\nYou may have money that you are saving for other long-term goals, such as retirement, with which you are\nwilling to take some risk. The extra return that you will earn for taking on risk is known as the risk premium.\nThe risk premium can be thought of as your reward for being willing to bear risk.\nThe risk premium is calculated as the difference between the return you receive for taking on risk and what\nyou would have returned if you did not take on risk. Using the average return of the S&P 500 (to measure what\ninvestors who bear the risk earn) and the US Treasury bill rate (to measure what investors who do not bear\nrisk earn), the risk premium is calculated as\nBeta\nThe risk premium represents how much an investor who takes on the market portfolio is rewarded for risk.\nInvestors who purchase one stock—DAL, for example—experience volatility, which is measured by the\nstandard deviation of that stock’s returns. Remember that some of that volatility, the volatility caused by firm-\nspecific risk, can be diversified away. Because investors can eliminate firm-specific risk through diversification,\nthey will not be rewarded for that risk. Investors are rewarded for the amount of systematic risk they incur.\n5\n“Historical Return on Stocks, Bonds and Bills: 1928–2020.” Damodaran Online.

For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3.

The return for DAL during\nNovember 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.\nYou can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return\nfor DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL\nis also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta.

Two internet sources\nthat can be used to find a company’s beta are Yahoo! Finance (https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo) and\nMarketWatch (https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact\nsame value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021, Yahoo! Finance reported that the\nbeta for DAL was 1.46,8 while MarketWatch reported it as 1.29.9 Both of these numbers are slightly\ndifferent from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.\nThere are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in\nthe beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta in Figure 15.3. Time frames\nranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different\nsources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are\nused in Figure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data. Finally, the S&P 500 is used to measure the market\nreturn in Figure 15.3; the S&P 500 is one of the most common measures of overall market returns, but\nalternatives exist and are used by some analysts\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCAPM\nWatch this video (https://openstax.org/r/pricing-model-capm) for further information about the CAPM.\n8\n“Delta Air Lines, Inc.

To begin, monthly returns must be\ncalculated from the price data using the formula\nThe ending prices shown in Figure 15.4 are the last price the stock traded for each month. Each month, the\nreturn is calculated under the assumption that you purchased the stock at the last trading price of the\nprevious month and sold at the last price of the current month. Thus, the return for January 2018 is calculated\nas\nThis is accomplished in Excel by placing the formula =(B3-B2)/B2 in cell C3.

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the\nportfolio returns can also be calculated easily. By comparing the returns of a stock with the returns of the\noverall market using Excel charting tools, the beta for a stock, which measures systematic risk, can be\ndetermined.\nKey Terms\narithmetic average return\nthe sum of an asset’s annual returns over a number of years divided by the\nnumber of years\nbeta\na measure of how a stock moves relative to the market\ncapital asset pricing model (CAPM)\nthe expected return of a security, equal to the risk-free rate plus a\npremium for the amount of risk taken\ncapital gain yield\nthe difference between the price a stock is sold for and the price that was originally paid\nfor it divided by the price originally paid\ndiversification\nholding a variety of assets in a portfolio\ndividend yield\nthe total dividends received by the owner of a share of stock divided by the price originally\npaid for the stock\neffective annual rate (EAR)\nreturns expressed on an annualized or yearly basis; allows for the comparison\nof various investments\nfirm-specific risk\nthe risk that an event may impact the expected revenue or costs of a firm, thereby\n472\n15 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nimpacting the returns to investors; also known as diversifiable risk\ngeometric average return\nthe compound annual return derived from the effective annual rate and time\nvalue of money formulas\nholding period percentage return\nthe gain received from holding a stock, calculated by adding the amount\nreceived when the stock is sold to any dividends earned while holding the stock, subtracting the price\noriginally paid for the stock, then dividing the difference by the price originally paid\nJensen’s alpha",

When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length of time in which a\nproject must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods\nthan the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s were to set a payback period of four\nyears, Project A would be accepted, but Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and so would\nbe rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years would be arbitrary; it is not grounded in any\nfinancial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of three, four, five, or\nany other number of years as its criterion for accepting projects.\nA third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all\nhave payback periods of five years. However, Projects B and C end after year 5, while Project D has a large cash\nflow that occurs in year 6, which is excluded from the analysis. The payback method is shortsighted in that it\nfavors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash\nflows after the arbitrary payback time criterion.\nFourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful the planning and analysis,\na business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier than others, with less\ncertain cash flows, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash\nflows.\n16.1 • Payback Period Method\n481\n16.2\nNet Present Value (NPV) Method\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine net present value.\n•\nCalculate net present value.\n•\nList the advantages and disadvantages of using the net present value method.\n•\nGraph an NPV profile.\nNet Present Value (NPV) Calculation\nSam’s purchasing of the embroidery machine involves spending money today in the hopes of making more\nmoney in the future. Because the cash inflows and outflows occur in different time periods, they cannot be\ndirectly compared to each other. Instead, they must be translated into a common time period using time value\nof money techniques. By converting all of the cash flows that will occur from a project into present value, or\ncurrent dollars, the cash inflows from the project can be compared to the cash outflows. If the cash inflows\nexceed the cash outflows in present value terms, the project will add value and should be accepted. The\ndifference between the present value of the cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows is known as\nnet present value (NPV).\nThe equation for NPV can be written as\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision of whether to purchase the embroidery machine. If we assume that\nafter six years the embroidery machine will be obsolete and the project will end, when placed on a timeline,\nthe project’s expected cash flow is shown in Table 16.3:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($) (16,000) 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000\nTable 16.3\nCalculating NPV is simply a time value of money problem in which each cash flow is discounted back to the\npresent value. If we assume that the cost of funds for Sam’s is 9%, then the NPV can be calculated as\nBecause the NPV is positive, Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the embroidery machine. The value of the\nfirm will increase by $2,835.63 as a result of accepting the project.\nCalculating NPV involves computing the present value of each cash flow and then summing the present values\nof all cash flows from the project. This project has six future cash flows, so six present values must be\ncomputed. Although this is not difficult, it is tedious.\nA financial calculator is able to calculate a series of present values in the background for you, automating\nmuch of the process. You simply have to provide the calculator with each cash flow, the time period in which\neach cash flow occurs, and the discount rate that you want to use to discount the future cash flows to the\npresent.\nFollow the steps in Table 16.4 for calculating NPV:\n482\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSelect cash flow worksheet\nCF\nCF\nCF0\nXXXX\n2\nClear the cash flow worksheet\n2ND\n2ND [CLR WORK] CF0\n0\n3\nEnter initial cash flow\n16000 +/-\n+/- ENTER\nENTER CF0 = -16,000.00\n4\nEnter cash flow for the first year\n↓\n2000 ENTER\nENTER\nC01 =\n2,000.00\n↓\nF01 =\n1.0\n5\nEnter cash flow for the second year ↓\n4000 ENTER\nENTER\nC02 =\n4,000.00\n↓\nF02 =\n1.0\n6\nEnter cash flow for the third year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC03 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF03 =\n1.0\n7\nEnter cash flow for the fourth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC04 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF04 =\n1.0\n8\nEnter cash flow for the fifth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC05 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF05 =\n1.0\n9\nEnter cash flow for the sixth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC06 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF06 =\n1.0\n10\nSelect NPV\nNPV\nNPV\nI\n0.00\n11",

If one project is 5 years and another is 20 years, the short one is\n492\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nrepeated four times. This method can become tedious when the length of the longer project is not a multiple\nof the shorter project. For example, when choosing between a five-year project and a seven-year project, the\nshort one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated five times\nto get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.\nEqual Annuity Approach\nThe equal annuity approach assumes that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated\nforever. This approach involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\n•\nThe NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\n•\nThe NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\nproject.\n•\nFor the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.\n•\nFor the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\nformula.\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that\nprojects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions\nare likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the\nfuture, these changes are potentially greater.\nChoosing Projects When Resources Are Limited\nChoosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will\nchoose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount\nof capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several\npositive NPV projects.

An advantage of using Excel is that you can quickly change any\nassumptions or numbers in your problem and recalculate NPV or IRR based on that updated information.\nExcel is a versatile tool with more than one way to set up most problems. We will consider a couple of\nstraightforward examples of using Excel to calculate NPV and IRR.\nSuppose your company is considering a project that will cost $30,000 this year. The cash inflow from this\nproject is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8,000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to\nincrease by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in year 7, the final year of the project. You know\nthat your company’s cost of funds is 9%. Your company would like to evaluate this project.\nCalculating NPV Using Excel\nTo calculate NPV using Excel, you would begin by placing each year’s expected cash flows in a sheet, as in row\n5 in Figure 16.4. One approach to calculating NPV is to use the formula for discounting future cash flows, as is\nshown in row 6.\nFigure 16.4 Inserting Present Cash Flows Using Excel ($ except Cost of Funds)\nFigure 16.5 shows the present value of each year’s cash flow resulting from the formula. The NPV is then\ncalculated by summing the present values of the cash flows.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file) containing key Chapter 16\nExcel exhibits.\nFigure 16.5 NPV Calculated by Summing Present Values of Cash Flows ($ except Cost of Funds)\nAlternatively, Excel is programmed with financial functions, including a calculation for NPV. The NPV formula is\nshown in cell J7 in Figure 16.6 below. However, it is important to pay attention to how Excel defines NPV. The\nExcel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period 1 through\nthe end of the project using the designated discount rate, but it fails to include the initial investment at time\n496\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nperiod zero at the beginning of the project. The NPV function in cell J6 will return $56,947 for this project. You\nmust subtract the initial cash outflow of $30,000 that occurs at time 0 to get the NPV of $26,947 for the project.\nWhen entering the Excel-programmed NPV function, you must remember to include references only to the\ncells that contain cash flows from year 1 to the end of the project. Then, subtract the initial investment of year\n0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV—the present values of the cash inflows minus\nthe present value of the cash outflow. Note: Because of the nonstandard use of the term NPV by Excel, many\nusers prefer to use the method described above rather than this predefined function.\nFigure 16.6 NPV Formula ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nCalculating IRR Using Excel\nExcel also provide a function for calculating IRR. This function is shown in Figure 16.7, cell J8. The IRR function\nproperly uses all the project’s cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at time 0, in its calculation, unlike\nthe NPV function. This function will correctly return the IRR of 27.7% for the project. Figure 16.8 shows the\ncompleted spreadsheet.\nFigure 16.7 Function for Calculating IRR ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nFigure 16.8 Final Spreadsheet ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nUsing Excel to Create an NPV Profile\nFirms often do not know exactly what their cost of attracting capital is, so they must use estimates in their\ndecision-making. Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions.\nEspecially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to\nchanges in financing costs. Excel simplifies the creation of an NPV profile.\nMiddleton Manufacturing is considering installing solar panels to heat water and provide lighting throughout\nits plant. To do so will cost the company $800,000 this year. However, this upgrade will save the company an\nestimated $150,000 in electrical costs each year for the next 10 years. Constructing an NPV profile of this\nproject will allow Middleton to see how the NPV of the project changes with the cost of attracting funds.",

The YTM of 6.312% represents what investors are currently\nrequiring to purchase the debt issued by the company.\nAfter-Tax Cost of Debt\nAlthough current debt holders demand to earn 6.312% to encourage them to lend to Bluebonnet Industries,\nthe cost to the firm is less than 6.312%. This is because interest paid on debt is a tax-deductible expense.

The yield to maturity on the company’s bonds is 7.2%. The cost of preferred equity is 9.17%. In\nthe most recent year, Greene paid a dividend of $3.15 to its common shareholders. This dividend has been\ngrowing at a rate of 3.0% per year, which is expected to continue in the future. The company’s common\nstock is trading for $32.25 per share.

This can be done using the constant\ndividend growth model:\nThe weights and the costs for each component of capital are placed in the WACC formula:\nThe WACC for Greene Building Company is estimated to be 9.47%. Note that debt financing is the cheapest\ncost of capital for Greene. The reason for this is twofold. First, because debt holders face the least amount\nof risk because they are paid first in the order of claimants, they require a lower return. Second, because\ninterest payments are tax-deductible, the interest tax shield lowers the effective cost of debt to the\n524\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompany. Preferred shareholders will require a higher rate of return than debt holders, 9.17%, because\nthey are later in the order of claimants. Common shareholders are the residual claimants, standing at the\nend of the line to receive payment. After all other claimants are paid, any remaining money belongs to the\nshareholders. If this residual amount is small, the common shareholders receive a small payment. If there is\nnothing left after all other claimants have been paid, common shareholders receive nothing. Thus, common\nshareholders have the greatest amount of risk and require the highest rate of return.\nAlso, note that the weights for debt, preferred stock, and common stock in the capital structure sum to\n100%. The company must finance 100% of its assets.\nIssuing New Common Stock\nAn existing firm can acquire equity capital to expand its assets in two ways: the retention of earnings or the\nsale of new shares of stock. Thus far in the chapter, the cost of equity capital calculations have assumed that\nthe earnings were being retained for equity capital financing.\nThe net income that is left after all expenses are paid is the residual income that belongs to the shareholders.\nInstead of receiving a fixed payment for letting the firm use their capital (like bondholders who receive fixed\ninterest payments), the reward to shareholders for letting the company use their capital varies from year to\nyear. In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth. Shareholders are willing to allow the company to retain these\nearnings because they expect that the money will be used to fund profitable projects, leading to an even larger\nreward for shareholders in future years.\nAlthough managers do not need to actively solicit the funds that are retained to fund the business, managers\ncannot view these funds as costless. The shareholders will require a return on those funds to entice them to\nallow the company to delay paying the dollars to them immediately in terms of a dividend.\nSuppose a company has $1 million in net income one year. If it pays $250,000 in dividends and retains\n$750,000, then it can finance $750,000 more in assets. If the company has a capital structure of 25% debt and\n75% equity and wants to maintain that capital structure, it must increase its debt by $250,000 to balance the\nincrease in equity. Thus, the company would be increasing its total financing by $1 million.

Using the company’s net sales figures for the current and prior years, what percentage might you\nrecommend for their sales forecast for the next year?\nSolution:\nBig 5’s sales for 2020 and 2019 were $1,041,212,000 and $996,495,000, respectively. This represents a 4.5%\ngrowth from the prior year.

These estimates will be reviewed, assessed, and updated as\nmore information and other factors are taken into consideration.\nIt can also be helpful to look at a shorter period, perhaps just the last few months, on a more detailed basis (by\ndepartment, by customer, etc.) to see if there are any possible new trends beginning to develop that might be\nan indicator of performance in the coming year. For example, Clear Lake Sporting Goods might look at\ndetailed sales records for October, November, and December and see that it had an old product line that was\ndiscontinued in early October, which contributed to a 2% reduction in monthly sales. This reduction in monthly\nsales will likely continue into the new year until the new line the company has signed on begins arriving in\nstores. Thus, the management team feels they should reduce their first quarter monthly estimates by 2%, as\nreflected in Figure 18.10.

Circumstances can often\nchange to make the future quite different from the past. The business itself may change, the economy can\nchange, the customer base may undergo a shift in demographics or a change in buying habits, new\ncompetition may emerge, and so on.

            "chunk": "for future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many people in\n18.3 • Pro Forma Financials\n545\nquarantine still wanting to make healthy lifestyle choices, sporting goods stores were making record sales.\nRecord-breaking sales, however, are not certain in the future. The impacts of the pandemic are extremely\ndifficult to predict, making it a challenge for Big 5 Sporting Goods and other companies to assemble pro\nforma financial statements.\n(sources: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/27/2115470/0/en/Big-5-Sporting-Goods-\nCorporation-Announces-Record-Fiscal-2020-Third-Quarter-Results.html; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/\ninvestors-want-big-5-sporting-054658521.html; https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/accounting-audit/\nnews/21206691/four-ways-covid19-will-impact-2021-financial-forecasting-and-planning)\nDetermine Potential Changes in Variables\nSo far, we have focused on using historical common-size statements to create a draft (not a final version) of\nthe forecast. This is because the past isn’t always a perfect indicator of the future, and our finances don’t\nalways follow a linear pattern. We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we\nknow to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.\nMany items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,\ngather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the\npotential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an\nexhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.\n•\nIt has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in\nmonthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.\n•\nIt will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to\nbegin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s\nmonthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,\nand August.\n•\nThe company has just finished updating its employee compensation package. It goes into effect in January\nof the new year and will result in an overall 4% increase in the cost of labor.\n•\nThe landlord indicated that rent will increase by $50 per month starting July 1.\n•\nSome fixed assets will be fully depreciated by the end of March. Thus, depreciation expense will go down\nby $25 per month beginning in April.\n•\nThere are rumors of new regulations that will impact the costs of importing some of the more difficult-to-\nobtain hunting supplies.

Figure 18.13 shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods using all of this data.\nFigure 18.13 Forecasted Income Statement\nForecast the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales. Thus, Clear Lake estimates its\nunearned revenue balance each month by taking the current month’s net sales from the forecasted income\nstatement and multiplying it by 50%.\nShort-term investments, notes payable, and common stock are not anticipated to change, so the current\nbalance is forecasted to remain the same for the next 12 months.\n548\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo forecast the ending balance for retained earnings for each month, managers add the monthly net income\nfrom the forecasted balance sheet to the prior balance and subtract a quarterly $10,000 dividend.\nOnce all of these accounts are completed, the balance sheet is out of balance. Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable. Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),\nand the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other\nexpenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.\nWe learned in Financial Statements that net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.",

It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth\nIt’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow. While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months.

They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential\nchanges they are considering. They may reduce the new salaries package by a percentage point to see if it\ngets them closer to their goal. They may adjust cost of goods sold by a certain percentage if they feel they can\nnegotiate with vendors to work down their costs. They may adjust rent and see if they can find a better retail\nlocation to either reduce costs or increase sales due to increased foot traffic in a new location. They may save\nan entirely new version of the forecast and change it drastically to see what investing in opening a second\nretail location would do.\nAs you can see, the list of possibilities is endless. Though the main goal of financial managers may be cash\nplanning, the power of a well-developed forecast is tremendous. It can help assess potential growth, new\nopportunities, and even small changes in the business as well.\nSensitivity Analysis in Forecasting\nSensitivity analysis will often look at the change in just one variable rather than the entire scenario. It\nexamines how sensitive a particular output (commonly net income) will be to a change in a particular\nunderlying input (sales or costs, for example). What if sales are 10% more or less than forecasted? What if the\nprices the firm can charge its customers are 10% more or less? What if the cost of goods sold increases by\n10%? The purpose is to see which variables are crucial to “get right.” It isn’t worth spending a lot of research\ndollars to make sure you are accurately predicting a variable if that variable won’t notably change the\noutcome. However, a slight change in other variables may have significant impact.\nUsing pro forma financial statements created in Excel allows management to quickly generate new pro forma\nfinancials and see the impact that each possible variable might have on the overall financial results.\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n553\n18.6\nUsing Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a financial statement forecast using spreadsheet tools.\n•\nConnect the balance sheet and income statement using appropriate formula referencing.\n•\nUse spreadsheet functions to generate appropriate iterations that balance financial forecasts.\nThroughout this chapter, we have seen forecasted financial statements for Clear Lake Sporting Goods along\nwith its forecasted cash flow. These statements could all have been generated by hand, of course, but that\nwouldn’t be an effective use of time. As mentioned in prior sections, several different types of software can be\nquite effective in making the forecasting process faster and more flexible. In this section, we will review just\none common option, Microsoft Excel.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file) containing key Chapter 18\nExcel exhibits.\nUsing the “Sheet”\nCreating a budget in Excel can be very simple or extremely complex, depending on the size and complexity of\nthe business and the number of formulas and dependencies that are written into the Excel workbook.\nCreating the forecast in Excel follows the same steps and flow we just explored in this chapter but with the\npower of a software program to do the math for you. We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key\nformulas in Excel.\n1.\nFirst, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is\ncalculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. In Figure 18.19, you\ncan see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase\nthe prior year’s sales by 18%.\n2.\nNext, the sales are distributed by month. In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula\nthen multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last\nquarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new\nyear by roughly 2%.\nFigure 18.19 Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel\n3.",

This means that if all the current assets could be converted to cash,\nthen the current liabilities could be satisfied two times.\nThere are two drawbacks to the current ratio: (1) it is a working capital analytic as of a point in time but is not\nindicative of future liquidity or future cash flows and (2) as an indicator of liquidity, it can be deceptive if a\nsignificant proportion of the current assets are inventory, supplies, or prepaid expenses. Inventory is not very\nliquid as it can take an extended time period to convert to cash, and assets such as supplies and prepaid\nexpenses never become cash and therefore are not a source of funds to pay bills.\nThe quick ratio is considered a more conservative indication of liquidity since it does not include a firm’s\n568\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninventory:\n.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nQuick Ratio\nA company’s current assets total $2,000,000, but $500,000 of that is inventory and the current liabilities total\n$1,000,000. What is the quick ratio, and what does it mean?\nSolution:\nThe quick ratio would be\nand would indicate a smaller cushion of net\nworking capital.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCash Ratio\nThe cash ratio is even more conservative in that it presents a picture of liquidity by excluding all current\nassets except cash and marketable securities.\nA company’s total current assets are $2,000,000, but only $1,100,000 of the current assets consist of cash\nand marketable securities. Assuming $1,000,000 of current liabilities, what would be the cash ratio and what\ndoes it mean?\nSolution:\nThe cash ratio would be\nand the amount of cash is enough to pay the\ncurrent bills by $100,000.\nWorking capital ratios, like any financial ratio, are most valuable when examined in light of trends and in\ncomparison to industry/peer averages. For example, a deteriorating current ratio over several quarters (a\ndecline in the company’s current ratio) could indicate a reduced ability to pay bills.\nWorking capital ratios are also compared to industry averages, which are available in databases produced by\nsuch financial publishers as Dun & Bradstreet, Dow Jones Company, and the Risk Management Association\n(RMA). These information services are available via subscriptions and through many libraries. For example, if a\ncompany’s current ratio is 0.9 while the industry average is 2.0, then the company is less liquid than the\naverage company in its industry and strategies, and techniques need to be considered to change things and to\nbetter compete with peer groups. Industry averages can be aspirational, motivating management to set\nliquidity goals and best practices for working capital management.\nIt is common to think about working capital with a simple assumption: current assets are being “financed” by\ncurrent liabilities. However, such an assumption may be an oversimplification. Some level of current assets is\noften necessary to meet longer-term obligations, and in that way, you could think of some amount of current\nassets as a permanent based of working capital that may need to be financed with longer-term sources of\ncapital.\nThink of a company with seasonal business. During busy times, more working capital will be needed than\nduring certain other portions of the year, such as less busy times. But there will always be some level—a\npermanent base—of working capital needed. Think of it this way: the total working capital of many companies\nwill ebb and flow depending on many variables such as the operating cycle, production needs, and the growth\nof revenue. Therefore, working capital can be thought of as having a permanent base that is always needed\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n569\nand a total working capital amount that increases when activity levels (i.e., production and sales volume) are\nhigher (see Figure 19.2).\nThe Cash Cycle\nThe cash cycle, also called the cash conversion cycle, is the time period between when a business begins\nproduction and acquires resources from its suppliers (for example, acquisition of materials and other forms of\ninventory) and when it receives cash from its customers. This is offset by the time it takes to pay suppliers\n(called the payables deferral period).\nFigure 19.2 Working Capital Needs Can Vary: Temporary and Permanent Working Capital\nThe cash cycle is measured in days, and it is best understood by examining its formula:\nThe inventory conversion period is also called the days of inventory. It is the time (days) it takes to convert\ninventory to sales and is calculated by following these steps:\n1.\nFirst, calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio using this formula:\nThe Average Inventory is arrived at as follows:\n2.\nThen, use the Inventory Turnover Ratio to calculate the Inventory Conversion Period:\nThe receivables collection period, also called the days sales outstanding (DSO) or the average collection",

Accounts payable is a type of obligation that is interest-free and is distinguished\nfrom debt obligations, such as notes payable, that require the creditor to pay back principal and interest.\n2\nUS Small Business Administration. “PPP Loan Forgiveness.” n.d. https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-\noptions/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-loan-forgiveness\n19.2 • What Is Trade Credit?\n575\nHow Trade Credit Works\nTrade credit is common in B2B (business to business) transactions and is analogous to consumer spending\nusing a credit card. With a credit card, a consumer opens an account with a credit limit. Most trade credit is\noffered to a company with an open account that has a credit limit up to which the company can purchase\ngoods or services without having to pay the cash up front. As long as the payments are made in accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement (also called credit terms), no interest or additional fees are charged on the\ncredit balance except possibly for a fee for late payment.\nInitially, the vendor’s credit department approves both a trade credit limit and credit payment terms (i.e.,\nnumber of days after the invoice date that payment is due). Timely payments on accounts payable (trade\ncredit) helps create a credit history for the purchasing firm.\nTrade Credit Terms\nTrade credit arrangements often carry credit terms that offer an incentive, called a discount, for a company\n(the buyer) to pay its bill within a relatively short period of time. Net terms, also referred to as the full credit\nperiod, are the number of days that a business (purchaser) has before they must pay their invoice. A common\nnet term is Net 30, with payment due in full within 30 days of the invoice.\nMany vendors also offer cash discounts to customers that pay their bill early. A company’s invoice that\nspecifies payment terms of “2/10 n/30” (stated as: “two ten net 30”) would allow a 2 percent discount if the\nbuyer’s account balance is paid within 10 days of the invoice date; otherwise, the net amount owed would be\ndue in 30 days. The “10 days” in the example is the discount period—the number of days the buyer has to\ntake advantage of the cash discount for an early payment, also known as quick payment.\nFor example, Jackson’s Premium Jams Inc. received a $10,500 invoice for the purchase of jelly jars. The invoice\nhas payment terms of 2/10 n/30. Jackson’s pays the bill within 10 days of the invoice date. Jackson’s payment\nwould be\n. The effect of taking a discount because of a quick payment\nis a lowering of the cost of inventory in the case of purchases of materials (for a manufacturer), merchandise\n(for a retailer or wholesaler), and operating expenses (for any company that “buys” services using trade\ncredit). In Cost of Trade Credit, there is an example that shows the high annualize opportunity cost (36.73\npercent) of not taking advantage of cash discounts.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nTrade Credit of International Trade\nWhen international trade occurs, two important documents are commonly required: a letter of credit and\na bill of lading. A letter of credit is issued by a financial institution on behalf of the foreign buyer\n(importer). The bill of lading is a legal document that gives proof of a contract between a transportation\ncompany and the buyer and is one important piece of documentation that allows the buyer to draw on the\nletter of credit. A bill of lading serves as a document of title and proof of receipt of goods by the shipper.\nThe letter of credit secures a promise of payment to the seller (exporter) provided that the terms of the sale\nare met. For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a\nliability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.\nCost of Trade Credit\nTrade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,\nbank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade\ncredit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts\npayable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long\n576\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nas payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.\nHowever, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of\ncash discounts when offered by sellers. Using accounts payable to purchase goods and services can involve an\nopportunity cost—a cost of the forgone opportunity of making a quick payment and benefiting from a cash\ndiscount.

A business that does not take advantage of a cash discount for early payment of trade credit will pay\nmore for goods and services than a business that routinely takes advantage of discounts.\nThe annual percentage rate of forgoing quick payment discounts can be estimated with the following formula:\nExample: Novelty Accessories Inc. (NAI) purchases products from a vendor that offers credit payment terms of\n2/10, net 30. The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73\npercent.\n19.3\nCash Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why firms hold cash.\n•\nList instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.\nCash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows. To manage\ncash, the cash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected\nevents. Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than",

That is because purchases by Target’s customers who use\ntheir credit cards (e.g., VISA or MasterCard) create very short-term receivables—amounts that Target is waiting\nto collect but are very close to a cash sale. So instead of being reported as accounts receivable—a line item on\nthe Target balance sheet that is separate from cash and cash equivalents—these amounts receivable from\nthird-party financial institutions are considered part of the cash and cash equivalents and are a very liquid asst.\nFor example, the amount of $560,000,000 for January 30, 2021, is considered a cash equivalent since the\nsettlement of these accounts will happen in a day or two with cash deposited in Target’s bank accounts. When\na retailer sells product and accepts a credit card such as VISA, MasterCard, or American Express, the cash\ncollection happens very soon after the credit card sale—typically within 24 to 72 hours.3\nCompanies also invest excess funds in marketable securities.

The establishment of and changes to credit terms are usually made in\nconsultation with the sales and financial management departments.\nMonitoring Accounts Receivables\nFinancial managers monitor accounts receivables using some basic tools. One of those tools is the accounts\nreceivable aging schedule (report). To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account\nbalances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.\nAn account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500\n($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.\n19.4 • Receivables Management\n581\nFigure 19.6 Foodinia Inc. Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender). Sometimes a company might request that a slow-paying customer sign a note",

Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk. In 2020, corporations experienced an unprecedented risk\nbecause of COVID-19. Coffee shops were forced to remain closed as communities experienced government-\n3\nStarbucks. Starbucks Fiscal 2020 Annual Report.

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of\noperating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStarbucks\nThe most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on\nthe company’s investor relations website under the Financial Data section (https://openstax.org/r/\nFinancial_Data_section).

            "chunk": "suppliers. Starbucks, for example, could enter into an agreement with a coffee farmer to purchase a particular\nquantity of coffee beans at a predetermined price over the next several years.\nThese long-term contracts can benefit both the buyer and the seller. The buyer is concerned that rising\ncommodity prices will increase its cost of goods sold. The seller, however, is concerned that falling commodity\nprices will mean lower revenue. By entering into a long-term contract, the buyer is able to lock in a price for its\nraw materials and the seller is able to lock in its sales price. Thus, both parties are able to reduce uncertainty.\nWhile long-term contracts reduce uncertainty about the commodity price, and thus reduce risk, there are\nseveral possible disadvantages to these types of contracts. First, both parties are exposed to the risk that the\nother party may default and fail to live up to the terms of the contract. Second, these contracts cannot be\nentered into anonymously; the parties to the contract know each other’s identity. This lack of anonymity may\nhave strategic disadvantages for some firms. Third, the value of this contract cannot be easily determined,\nmaking it difficult to track gains and losses. Fourth, canceling the contract may be difficult or even impossible.\n5\nData from International Monetary Fund. “Global Price of Coffee, Other Mild Arabica (PCOFFOTMUSDM).” FRED.

For Starbucks, a vertical integration would involve\nStarbucks owning a coffee bean farm. If the price of coffee beans rises, the firm’s costs increase and the\nsupplier’s revenues rise. The two companies can offset these risks by merging.\nAlthough vertical integration can reduce commodity price risk, it is not a perfect hedge. Starbucks may\ndecrease its commodity price risk by purchasing a coffee farm, but that action may expose it to other risks,\nsuch as land ownership and employment risk.\nFutures Contracts\nAnother method of hedging commodity price risk is the use of a futures contract. A commodity futures\ncontract is designed to avoid some of the disadvantages of entering into a long-term contract with a supplier.\nA futures contract is an agreement to trade an asset on some future date at a price locked in today. Futures\nexist for a range of commodities, including natural resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, silver, and gold and\nagricultural products such as soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, sugar, and cocoa.\nFutures contracts are traded anonymously on an exchange; the market price is publicly observable, and the\nmarket is highly liquid. The company can get out of the contract at any time by selling it to a third party at the\ncurrent market price.\nA futures contract does not have the credit risk that a long-term contract has. Futures exchanges require\ntraders to post margin when buying or selling commodities futures contracts. The margin, or collateral, serves\nas a guarantee that traders will honor their obligations. Additionally, through a procedure known as marking\nto market, cash flows are exchanged daily rather than only at the end of the contract. Because gains and\nlosses are computed each day based on the change in the price of the futures contract, there is not the same\nrisk as with a long-term contract that the counterparty to the contract will not be able to fulfill their obligation.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe CME Group\nIn 2007, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange merged with the Chicago Board of Trade to form CME Group Inc.\nCME Group provides trading in futures as well as other types of contracts that companies can use to hedge\nrisk.\nYou can watch the video Getting Started with Your Broker (https://openstax.org/r/\nGetting_Started_with_Your_Broker) to learn how futures contracts for agricultural products such as coffee\nbeans, corn, wheat, and soybeans are traded.

Managers must be aware of\ndiffering business climates and customs and operate under multiple legal systems. Often, business must be\nconducted in multiple languages. Geopolitical events can impact business relationships. In addition, the\ncompany may receive cash flows and make payments in multiple currencies.\nExchange Rates\nThe costs to companies are impacted when the prices of the raw materials they use change. Very little coffee is\ngrown in the United States. This means that all of those coffee beans that Starbucks uses in its espresso\nmachines in Seattle, New York, Miami, and Houston were bought from suppliers outside of the United States.\nBrazil is the largest coffee-producing country, exporting about one-third of the world’s coffee.6 When a\ncompany purchases raw materials from a supplier in another country, the company needs not just money but\nthe money that is used in that country to make the purchase. Thus, the company is concerned about the\nexchange rate, or the price of the foreign currency.\nFigure 20.2 Brazilian Reals to One US Dollar7\nThe currency used in Brazil is called the Brazilian real. Figure 20.2 shows how many Brazilian reals could be\npurchased for $1.00 from 2010 through the first quarter of 2021. In March 2021, 5.4377 Brazilian reals could be\npurchased for $1.00. This will often be written in the form of\n6\nGlobal Agricultural Information Network. Brazil: Coffee Annual 2019. GAIN Report No. BR19006.

This price is known as a\ncurrency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nIf you know the price of $1.00 is 5.4377 Brazilian reals, you can easily find the price of Brazilian reals in US\ndollars. Simply divide both sides of the equation by 5.4377, or the price of the US dollar:\nIf you have US dollars and want to purchase Brazilian reals, it will cost you $0.1839 for each Brazilian real you\nwant to buy.\nThe foreign exchange rate changes in response to demand for and supply of the currency. In early 2020, the\nexchange rate was\n. In other words, $1 purchased fewer reals in early 2020 than in it did a\nyear later. Because you receive more reals for each dollar in 2021 than you would have a year earlier, the dollar\nis said to have appreciated relative to the Brazilian real. Likewise, because it takes more Brazilian reals to\npurchase $1.00, the real is said to have depreciated relative to the US dollar.\nExchange Rate Risks\nStarbucks, like other firms that are engaged in international business, faces currency exchange rate risk.\nChanges in exchange rates can impact a business in several ways. These risks are often classified as\ntransaction, translation, or economic risk.\nTransaction Risk\nTransaction risk is the risk that the value of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result\nof a change in currency exchange rates. If Starbucks agrees to pay a Brazilian coffee grower seven million\nBrazilian reals for an order of one million pounds of coffee beans, Starbucks will need to purchase Brazilian\nreals to pay the bill. How much it will cost Starbucks to purchase these Brazilian reals depends on the\nexchange rate at the time Starbucks makes the purchase.\nIn March 2021, with an exchange rate of\n, it would have cost Starbucks\nto purchase the reals needed to receive the one million pounds of coffee\nbeans. If, however, Starbucks agreed in March to purchase the coffee beans several months later, in July,\nStarbucks would not have known then what the exchange rate would be when it came time to complete the\ntransaction. Although Starbucks would have locked in a price of BRL 7,000,000 for one million pounds of coffee\nbeans, it would not have known what the coffee beans would cost the company in terms of US dollars.\nIf the US dollar appreciated so that it cost less to purchase each Brazilian real in July, Starbucks would find that\nit was paying less than $1,287,300 for the coffee beans. For example, suppose the dollar appreciated so that\nthe exchange rate was\nin July 2021. Then the coffee beans would only cost Starbucks\n.",

Options are considered derivative securities because the value of a derivative is\nderived from, or comes from, the value of another asset.\nOptions Terminology\nSpecific terminology is used in the finance industry to describe the details of an options contract. If the owner\nof an option decides to purchase or sell the asset according to the terms of the options contract, the owner is\nsaid to be exercising the option. The price the option holder pays if purchasing the asset or receives if selling\nthe asset is known as the strike price or exercise price. The price the owner of the option paid for the option is\nknown as the premium.\nAn option contract will have an expiration date. The most common kinds of options are American options,\nwhich allow the holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiration date. Holders of\nEuropean options may exercise their options only on the expiration date. The labels American option and\nEuropean option can be confusing as they have nothing to do with the location where the options are traded.\nBoth American and European options are traded worldwide.\nOption contracts are written for a variety of assets. The most common option contracts are options on shares\nof stock. Options are traded for US Treasury securities, currencies, gold, and oil. There are also options on\nagricultural products such as wheat, soybeans, cotton, and orange juice. Thus, options can be used by financial\nmanagers to hedge many types of risk, including currency risk, interest rate risk, and the risk that arises from\nfluctuations in the prices of raw materials.\nOptions are divided into two main categories, call options and put options. A call option gives the owner of\nthe option the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset. A put option gives the owner the\nright, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset.\nCall Options\nIf a Korean company knows that it will need pay a $100,000 bill to a US supplier in six months, it knows how\nmany US dollars it will need to pay the bill. As a Korean company, however, its bank account is denominated in\nKorean won. In six months, it will need to use its Korean won to purchase 100,000 US dollars.\nThe company can determine how many Korean won it would take to purchase $100,000 today. If the current\nexchange rate is\n, then it will need KWN 110,000,000 to pay the bill. The current\nexchange rate is known as the spot rate.\nThe company, however, does not need the US dollars for another six months. The company can purchase a call\noption, which is a contract that will allow it to purchase the needed US dollars in six months at a price stated in\nthe contract. This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate\nthe company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six\nmonths.\nThe price that is in the contract is called the strike price (exercise price). Suppose the company purchases a\ncall contract for US dollars with a strike price of KWN 1,200/USD. While this contract would be for a set size, or\na certain number of US dollars, we will talk about this transaction as if it were per one US dollar to highlight\nhow options contracts work.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n609\nThe company must pay a price, known as the premium, to purchase this call option contract. For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is",

If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is\n, then the company will choose to exercise\nthe option. The company will be saving KWN 25 for each dollar purchased, but the company originally paid 50\nKWN for the contract. So, the company will be 25 KWN worse off than if it had never purchased the call option.\nIf the spot exchange rate is\n, the company will be in exactly the same position having\npurchased and exercised the call option as it would have been if it had not purchased the option. At any spot\nprice higher than KWN 1,250/USD, the firm will be in a better financial position, or will have a positive payoff,\nbecause it purchased the call option. The more the Korean won depreciates over the next six months, the\nhigher the payoff to the firm of owning the call contract. Purchasing the call contract is a way that the\ncompany can protect itself from the currency exposure it faces.\nFor any transaction, there must be two parties—a buyer and a seller. For the company to have purchased the\ncall option, another party must have sold the call option. The seller of a call option is called the option writer.\nLet’s consider the potential benefits and risks to the writer of the call option.\nWhen the company purchases the call option, it pays the premium to the writer. The writer of the option does\nnot have a choice regarding whether the option will be exercised. The purchaser of the option has the right to\nmake the choice; in essence, the writer of the option sold the right to make that decision to the purchasers of\nthe call option.\n610\n20 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 20.5 shows the payoff to the writer of the call option. Recall that the buyer of the call option will let the\noption expire if the spot rate is less than\nwhen the call option matures in six months. If\nthis occurs, the writer of the option collected the KWN 50 option premium when the contract was sold and\nthen never hears from the purchaser again. This is what the writer of the option is hoping for; the writer of the\ncall option profits when the options contract is not exercised\nFigure 20.5 The Payoff to the Writer of a Call Option\nIf the spot rate is above\n, then the holder of the option will choose to exercise the right\nto purchase the won at the option strike price. Then the writer of the option will be obligated to sell the Korean\nwon at a price of KWN 1,200/USD. If the spot rate is\n, the option writer will be obligated\nto sell the dollars for KWN 50 less than what they are worth; because the option writer was initially paid a KWN\n50 premium for taking on that obligation, the option writer will just break even. For any exchange rate higher\nthan\n, the writer of the call option will have a loss.\nThe option contract is a zero-sum game. Any payoff the owner of the option receives is exactly equal to the\nloss the writer of the option has. Any loss the owner of the option has is exactly equal to the payoff the writer\nof the option receives.\nPut Options\nWhile the call option you just considered gives the owner the right to buy an underlying asset, the put option\ngives the owner to right to sell an underlying asset. Take, for example, an Indian company that has a contract\nto provide graphic artwork for a US company. The US company will pay the Indian company 200,000 US dollars\nin three months.\nWhile the Indian company receives US dollars, it must pay its workers in Indian rupees. Because the company\ndoes not know what the spot exchange rate will be in three months, it faces transaction risk and may be\ninterested in hedging this exposure using a put option.\nThe company knows that the current spot rate is\n, meaning that the company would be able\nto use $200,000 to purchase\nif it possessed the $200,000 today. If\nthe Indian rupee appreciates relative to the US dollar over the next three months, however, the company will\nreceive fewer rupees when it makes the exchange; perhaps the company will not be able to purchase enough\nrupees to cover the wages of its employees.\nAssume the company can purchase a put option that gives it the right to sell US dollars in three months at a\nstrike price of INR 75/USD; the premium for this put option is INR 5. By purchasing this put option, the\ncompany is spending INR 5 to guarantee that it can sell its US dollars for rupees in three months at a price of\nINR 75/USD.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n611",

In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit.

In essence, Beta is paying 5.5% to\nAlpha, 0.75% to its lender, and LIBOR to its lender.\nIn return, Alpha promises to pay Beta LIBOR. The exact amount that Alpha will pay to Beta fluctuates as LIBOR\nfluctuates. However, from Beta’s perspective, the payment of LIBOR it receives from Alpha exactly offsets the\npayment of LIBOR it makes to its lender. When LIBOR increases, the rate of\nthat Beta is\npaying to its lender increases, but the LIBOR rate it receives from Alpha also increases. When LIBOR decreases,\nBeta receives less from Alpha, but it also pays less to its lender. Because the LIBOR it receives from Alpha is\nexactly equal to the LIBOR it pays to its lender, Beta’s net amount of interest paid is 6.25%—the 5.5% it pays to\nAlpha plus the 0.75% it pays to its lender.\nAlpha is in the position of paying 5.0% to its lender and LIBOR to Beta while receiving 5.5% from Beta.

It would have cost Alpha\nto borrow the money from its lenders at a variable rate.\nBy participating in this swap arrangement, Alpha has been able to lower its interest rate by 0.75%.\nThrough this swap arrangement, Beta has been able to fix its interest rate at 6.25% rather than having a\nvariable rate. This predictability is a benefit for a company, especially one that is in a bit more precarious\nposition as far as its creditworthiness and stability. The 6.25% Beta pays as a result of this arrangement is 0.5%\nbelow the 6.75% it would have paid if it simply borrowed from its lenders at a fixed rate.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n617\nSummary\n20.1 The Importance of Risk Management\nRisk arises due to uncertainty. The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has",
