This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers.",

                    "answer": "Schools of legal thought are a set of philosophies that attempt to explain the purpose of law and how it should be interpreted and applied. These schools include natural law, legal positivism, and realism. Natural law argues that laws should be based on moral principles and that judges should interpret laws based on their understanding of these principles. Legal positivism, on the other hand, holds that laws should be based on the will of the people and that judges should interpret laws based on the intent of the lawmakers. Realism, meanwhile, argues that laws are created by powerful interests and that judges should interpret laws based on their understanding of the social and political context in which they were created. The relevance of these schools of thought is that they provide different perspectives on the role of law in society and how it should be interpreted and applied. Understanding these different perspectives can help us to better understand the role of law in society and how it can be used to promote justice and equality."

NGOs have a variety of purposes, including human rights, environmental protection, and the promotion of economic and social development. NGOs are often formed to advocate for specific causes or to provide services to people in need. NGOs are not subject to the same rules and regulations as governments, and they often have more flexibility in their operations. NGOs can play an important role in promoting democracy and human rights by holding governments accountable for their actions. NGOs can also provide valuable services to people in need, such as providing healthcare or education. NGOs are not always well-regulated, and they can sometimes be used for political purposes. However, NGOs can be an important force for good in the world."

The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, \npositive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies. It has also given you a brief background in common \nlaw, including contracts, torts, and criminal law. The differences between civil and criminal cases, \nsubstance and procedure, and the various sources of law have also been reviewed. Each source has a \ndifferent level of authority, starting with constitutions, which are primary and will negate any lower-court",

The deontological approach is often associated with the “formalist” approach to ethics.

The categorical imperative says that we should always act in such a way that we would be willing to have others act in the same way. For example, if you want to steal something, you would not want others to steal from you. Thus, you should not steal."

To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" The Commerce Clause was first used by Congress in the Tariff Act of 1789, which imposed taxes on imported goods. The clause has since been used to regulate a wide range of activities, including interstate commerce, foreign commerce, and intrastate commerce. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause to give Congress the power to regulate economic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce, even if the activity is purely intrastate. In recent years, the Court has also used the Commerce Clause to uphold federal laws that regulate a variety of activities, including gun control, environmental protection, and civil rights. The Commerce Clause is a powerful tool that Congress can use to regulate economic activity and promote the general welfare of the United States."

This can be confusing, because it seems like you should be able to know whether or not you have committed a crime based on your own thoughts and intentions. But the law is not always so clear-cut, and it is up to the courts to interpret the law and decide whether or not someone has committed a crime. So, even if you don't think you have committed a crime, you could still be found guilty of a crime if the law defines your actions as criminal.

The reason for this is that the corporation is a separate entity from its agents, and it is the corporation that is ultimately responsible for the actions of its agents.

A false pretense or representation is a statement of fact that is untrue, and which is made with the intent to deceive.

Negligent torts are not as serious because they are unintentional and the tortfeasor does not intend to cause harm. Therefore, punitive damages are not as necessary for negligent torts."

                    "answer": "Costs imposed on others without their consent are problematic for a market economy because it interferes with the free market. The free market is based on the principle of voluntary exchange, where both parties consent to the exchange. If costs are imposed on others without their consent, it interferes with the free market and the principle of voluntary exchange. If the law did not try to reimpose the victim’s costs onto the tortfeasor, it would result in a situation where the tortfeasor does not have to pay for the harm they caused. This would lead to a situation where there is no incentive for the tortfeasor to take responsibility for their actions and to avoid causing harm in the future. A totally nonlitigious society would be a society where there is no litigation or dispute resolution. In this society, there would be no need for courts or lawyers, and disputes would be resolved through other means such as mediation or arbitration. However, this would be a society where there is no accountability for harmful actions and no way to hold people responsible for their actions."

Absolute liability, on the other hand, is based on the idea that the defendant should be held liable for any harm that results from their activities, regardless of whether the activities are inherently dangerous. In terms of products-liability cases, the major defenses to a lawsuit are usually based on the idea that the plaintiff's injury was caused by their own negligence or was caused by a third party, rather than by the product itself.

This means that a party can be held liable for damages even if it did not intend to cause harm or was not negligent in its actions. Strict liability is often applied in cases involving dangerous activities, such as manufacturing, transportation, or the use of dangerous products. In these cases, the party may be held liable for damages caused by the dangerous activity, even if it was not aware of the risk of harm or took reasonable precautions to avoid it. The purpose of strict liability is to provide a remedy for victims of harm caused by dangerous activities and to deter parties from engaging in such activities in the future."

                    "question": "What is a defect in a product?",
                    "answer": "A defect in a product refers to any flaw or imperfection in the design, manufacturing, or marketing of a product that makes it dangerous or unsafe for its intended use. A defect can occur at any point in the product life cycle, from the initial design to the final sale. Examples of product defects include faulty wiring, poor workmanship, or incorrect labeling. A defect can cause a product to malfunction or fail to perform as intended, which can result in injury or property damage to the user. In some cases, a product defect may not be immediately apparent, but may become apparent over time as the product is used or as the user becomes more familiar with its intended use. In these cases, the defect may be considered a latent defect, which can be difficult to detect and may not be immediately apparent to the user. Regardless of the type of defect, it is important for manufacturers to take steps to identify and correct defects in their products to prevent harm to users and to ensure the safety of their products."

                    "answer": "Strict liability is a legal doctrine that makes a company responsible for any harm that their product causes. This means that if someone is injured by a product, the company that made the product is responsible for the injury, even if the company did not do anything wrong. This is different from negligence, which is when someone is responsible for their own actions. Strict liability is also different from intentional torts, which are when someone intentionally causes harm to another person. Strict liability is a controversial topic, as it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for an injury. However, it is important to note that strict liability is not always bad. In some cases, it can help to protect people from harm. For example, if a company makes a product that is dangerous, it should be held responsible for any injuries that the product causes. This can help to ensure that companies make safe products and that people are protected from harm. Overall, strict liability is a complex topic that has both pros and cons. It is important to carefully consider the issue before making a decision."

                    "answer": "Strict liability torts and negligent torts are both types of torts, which are civil wrongs that result in legal liability. However, there are some key differences between the two. In a strict liability tort, the defendant is liable for the harm caused by their product, even if they did not intend to cause harm. In a negligent tort, the defendant is liable for the harm caused by their negligence, which is a failure to act with the care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the same situation. The key difference between the two is that in a strict liability tort, the defendant is liable regardless of whether they intended to cause harm, while in a negligent tort, the defendant is only liable if they acted negligently. This means that in a strict liability tort, the defendant can be liable even if they did not intend to cause harm, while in a negligent tort, the defendant can only be liable if they acted negligently. The US legal system does allow strict liability torts. This is because strict liability torts can help to protect consumers from dangerous products. For example, if a company makes a product that is dangerous, it should be held responsible for any injuries that the product causes. This can help to ensure that companies make safe products and that people are protected from harm. Overall, strict liability torts can be a valuable tool in protecting consumers and holding companies accountable for their actions."

The reason why EBWS was not required to pay for the milk that was produced by the cows on the farm is because the contract between EBWS and Rock Bottom Farm was a supply contract, not a purchase contract. In a supply contract, the supplier (Rock Bottom Farm) is responsible for providing the goods (milk) to the buyer (EBWS), and the buyer is not responsible for paying for the goods until they are actually delivered. In this case, the milk was produced by the cows on the farm, but it was not delivered to EBWS because of the plant closure for repairs. Therefore, EBWS was not required to pay for the milk that was produced by the cows on the farm."

The agent is someone who is authorized to act on behalf of the principal, and the principal is the person or entity who is being represented. In the business and government context, agency law is important because it governs the relationship between the business or government entity and its employees, contractors, and other agents. It also governs the relationship between the business or government entity and the people it represents. For example, in the business context, agency law governs the relationship between a company and its employees, contractors, and other agents. It also governs the relationship between the company and its customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. In the government context, agency law governs the relationship between the government and its employees, contractors, and other agents.

General Agents: A general agent is an agent who is authorized to act on behalf of the principal in all matters within the scope of the agency. This type of agent has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the principal and to bind the principal to contracts. 2. Special Agents: A special agent is an agent who is authorized to act on behalf of the principal in a specific matter or for a specific purpose. This type of agent has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the principal and to bind the principal to contracts, but only within the scope of the specific matter or purpose for which they were appointed. 3. Attorneys-in-Fact: An attorney-in-fact is an agent who is authorized to act on behalf of the principal in a specific matter or for a specific purpose. This type of agent has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the principal and to bind the principal to contracts, but only within the scope of the specific matter or purpose for which they were appointed. 4.

This type of agent has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the principal and to bind the principal to contracts, but only within the scope of the specific task or duty for which they were employed. 5.

                    "answer": "An employee is a person who works for an employer in exchange for wages or a salary. An independent contractor is a person who works for an employer on a contractual basis. The key difference between an employee and an independent contractor is the level of control the employer has over the worker. An employee is typically subject to the employer's control and direction, while an independent contractor is generally free to work independently and set their own hours and rates. Additionally, employees are typically entitled to certain benefits, such as health insurance and retirement plans, while independent contractors are not. Finally, employees are typically subject to the employer's payroll taxes and other employment-related obligations, while independent contractors are not."

By classifying workers as independent contractors, employers can avoid paying payroll taxes, workers' compensation insurance, and other benefits that are typically associated with employment. This can save employers a significant amount of money, as employment taxes and other benefits can be costly. Additionally, employers may also try to pass off employees as independent contractors in order to avoid having to provide certain protections and benefits, such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and paid time off.

The employee gives up the right to sue the employer (and, in some states, other employees) and receives in exchange predetermined compensation for a job-related injury, regardless of who caused it. This trade-off was felt to be equitable to employer and employee: the employee loses the right to seek damages for pain and suffering—which can be a sizable portion of any award for a serious injury—and the employer loses the right to deny liability and thus avoid paying anything at all. The employer gets the benefit of not having to worry about being sued by an injured worker, and the employee gets the benefit of knowing that he or she will receive some compensation, regardless of fault. The system is financed by premiums paid by employers, based on the risk of injury in their business."

It is that authority which is reasonably necessary to carry out the express authority conferred on the agent. The agent's apparent authority extends to all acts which are incidental to the performance of the express authority, but which are not inconsistent with it. The apparent authority of the agent is limited to the scope of the express authority, and cannot be exercised for any purpose not connected with it.

This authority can be established through an explicit agreement between the principal and the agent, such as a written contract or a verbal agreement. In this case, the silence of the principal would not establish express authority, as there would be no evidence of an agreement between the principal and the agent. Instead, the agent would need to have a valid power of attorney or other authorization from the principal in order to act on the principal's behalf."

                    "answer": "The concept of implied authority is important in business situations because it allows for the delegation of authority and the ability to act on behalf of another party without the need for an explicit agreement or written contract. Implied authority can be established through the principal's actions or statements, such as by making it clear to the agent that they have the power to act on the principal's behalf. This can be especially important in situations where a quick decision needs to be made or where the principal is not physically present to give explicit authorization."

                    "answer": "The doctrine of apparent authority is based on the idea that the law should protect the reasonable expectations of third parties who deal with agents. If a third party deals with an agent in good faith, believing that the agent has the authority to act on behalf of the principal, the law should not allow the principal to avoid the contract simply because there was no actual principal-agent relationship.

Recognize the ways the agency relationship is terminated. \n \n \nAgent’s Personal Liability for Torts and Contracts \nTort Liability \nThat a principal is held vicariously liable and must pay damages to an injured third person does not \nexcuse the agent who actually committed the tortious acts. A person is always liable for his or her own \ntorts (unless the person is insane, involuntarily intoxicated, or acting under extreme duress). The agent is \npersonally liable for his wrongful acts and must reimburse the principal for any damages the principal was \nforced to pay, as long as the principal did not authorize the wrongful conduct.

The agent directed to \ncommit a tort remains liable for his own conduct but is not obliged to repay the principal.

The latter normally \npurchases insurance to cover against wrongful acts of agents, but liability insurance policies frequently do \nnot cover the employee’s personal liability if the employee is named in a lawsuit individually. Thus \ndoctors’ and hospitals’ malpractice policies protect a doctor from both her own mistakes and those of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n432 \nnurses and others that the doctor would be responsible for; nurses, however, might need their own \ncoverage.

In this chapter we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies, and we touch on joint ventures and business trusts. \nWhen two or more people form their own business or professional practice, they usually consider \nbecoming partners. Partnership law defines a partnership as “the association of two or more persons to \ncarry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a \npartnership.” [1] In 2011, there were more than three million business firms in the United States as \npartnerships (see Table 11.1 \"Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and \nLimited Liability Companies\", showing data to 2006), and partnerships are a common form of",

                    "answer": "Partnerships are formed by two or more individuals who come together to carry out a business venture. Partnerships are a common form of business ownership in the United States, and they offer several benefits to their owners. Some of the most important features of partnerships include:\n\n1. Limited Liability: Partners in a partnership are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. This means that if the business fails, the partners' personal assets are not at risk.\n2. Flexible Ownership: Partnerships can be structured in a variety of ways, allowing for different levels of ownership and control. This flexibility can be beneficial for businesses that need to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.\n3. Tax Benefits: Partnerships are taxed at the individual level, rather than at the corporate level. This can result in lower tax bills for the partners.\n4. Easier to Form: Partnerships are relatively easy to form, and they do not require the same level of paperwork and bureaucracy as corporations.\n5. Ability to Raise Capital: Partnerships can raise capital by selling ownership interests to investors. This can be a useful way to finance growth and expansion.\n\nOverall, partnerships offer a number of benefits to their owners, including limited liability, flexibility, tax benefits, ease of formation, and the ability to raise capital. However, it is important to note that partnerships also have some drawbacks, such as the potential for disagreements among partners and the lack of a separate legal entity for the business."

An oral agreement to form a partnership is valid unless the business cannot be performed \nwholly within one year from the time that the agreement is made. However, most partnerships have no \nfixed terms and hence are “at-will” partnerships not subject to the Statute of Frauds. \n \nEXERCISES",

First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own.

The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm \nitself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. \n \nUnder UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any \nmember from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an \nentity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs \nwhen any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA \nrequires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. \n \nDissociation",

The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2).

The housing bubble was caused by easy credit and low interest rates, which led to a surge in home prices. The subprime mortgage crisis was caused by lenders making loans to borrowers who could not afford them, leading to a wave of foreclosures. Other causes include the financial crisis, which was caused by the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, and the credit crunch, which was caused by the lack of liquidity in the financial markets."

The Act also imposed new regulations on banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, and required them to hold more capital to absorb losses in times of financial stress. The Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2008, and to protect consumers from predatory lending practices."

External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective.

CDs are typically offered by banks and credit unions, and they are designed to provide a safe and secure way to earn interest on savings. CDs are typically offered for a specific period of time, such as one year, two years, or five years, and the interest rate is fixed for the duration of the CD. CDs are insured by the FDIC, which means that the money deposited in a CD is protected up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. CDs are generally considered to be a low-risk investment, as they are insured by the FDIC and the interest rate is fixed. However, CDs may not offer the highest interest rates available, and they may have early withdrawal penalties if the CD is closed before the maturity date. CDs are a popular choice for people who want to earn a steady return on their savings, but who are not comfortable taking on the risk of other types of investments. NCDs, on the other hand, are not insured by the FDIC and are not offered by banks. NCDs are typically issued by corporations or governments, and they are designed to provide a way for investors to earn a return on their money without taking on the risk of other types of investments. NCDs are typically issued in denominations of $1,000 or more, and they have a fixed maturity date, which is the date on which the NCD will mature and the principal and interest will be paid back to the investor. NCDs are considered to be a higher risk investment than CDs, as they are not insured by the FDIC and the interest rate is not fixed. However, NCDs may offer higher interest rates than CDs, and they may also provide the opportunity for investors to earn a return on their money even if the market is experiencing a downturn.

The Treasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest payments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for Treasury notes."

The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest\npayments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\nJust as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations.

A dealer is a financial institution that acts as a principal in a trade, meaning they take on the risk of holding the security until it is sold. A broker, on the other hand, acts as an agent and does not take on any risk. In terms of market making, a broker is more likely to be a market maker than a dealer because they are not responsible for taking on any risk."

For example, a small business owner may want to know how changes in interest rates, inflation, and unemployment rates will affect their business. They may also want to know about the competition in their industry and the demand for their products or services. By understanding these factors, small business owners can make better decisions about things like pricing, production, and hiring."

However, it's important to remember that investing in the stock market is risky, and the Robinhood app doesn't provide any advice or guidance on how to invest. So, if you're not familiar with investing, it's important to do your own research and make sure you understand the risks before you start using the app. In terms of option trading, I think it's important to remember that options are a complex financial instrument and should only be used by experienced investors. So, I don't think that option trading should be more restricted than the video implies."

In\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\nSome examples of these might include the following:\n•\nExpanding sales to existing customers\n•",

The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States.

For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase. If such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the organization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the company as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus other stakeholders."

Companies that are required to file with the SEC are responsible for preparing and submitting their own filings. EDGAR was established to reduce the time it takes to gather information about companies and to provide greater access to this information. The SEC began using EDGAR in December 2000. The EDGAR system is maintained by the SEC's Office of Information Technology. EDGAR is designed to allow companies to submit filings in electronic format. It also allows investors to access company information from their personal computers. EDGAR provides a central repository for public companies' filings and other information. EDGAR filings include annual and quarterly financial reports, registration statements, proxy and information statements, and other forms. EDGAR filings are available to the public from the SEC website (https://openstax.org/r/sec-gov). The SEC provides information about EDGAR on its website (https://openstax.org/r/sec-gov)."

For example, if a dollar buys 100 pesos today, and the dollar appreciates, it will buy more than 100 pesos tomorrow. A depreciating dollar means that a dollar will buy less of another currency. For example, if a dollar buys 100 pesos today, and the dollar depreciates, it will buy less than 100 pesos tomorrow."

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.

At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\nThe Accounting Equation\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance. Therefore, we must\nensure that the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. We will explore the components of the\naccounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation",

If you were an investor considering investing a large sum of money into a company, what questions would you ask or what accounts would you look at to assess the impact to their income statement specifically? How would the characteristics of capitalization affect your feelings toward investing in the company?",
                    "answer": "Depreciation and capitalization impact the income statement by reducing the net income. If an investor were to invest a large sum of money into a company, they would want to know how the company plans to use the money and what the expected return on investment would be. They would also want to know how the company plans to depreciate and capitalize the new asset, as this will impact the company's income statement. The characteristics of capitalization, such as the useful life of the asset and the expected rate of return, would affect an investor's feelings toward investing in the company. If the asset has a long useful life and a high expected rate of return, the investor would be more likely to invest. However, if the asset has a short useful life and a low expected rate of return, the investor would be less likely to invest."

They have simply traded one asset for another. The delineation between expensing and capitalizing an asset relates to the useful life of the asset. If the asset has a long useful life, it should be capitalized and depreciated over time. If the asset has a short useful life, it should be expensed in the year it is acquired. The depreciation process is ethical as it allows companies to accurately reflect the financial condition of their business.

Charlie is a much bigger retailer for outdoor gear, as\nCharlie has nearly seven times greater sales than Clear Lake. Common-size statements allow Clear Lake to\ncompare their statements in a meaningful way (see Figure 5.26).

This was due to a number of factors, including the company's losses and the overall economic climate. The P/E ratio is a measure of the price of a company's stock relative to its earnings, and it can be used to compare different companies or to track the performance of a single company over time. In the case of Amazon, the P/E ratio decreased because investors were less willing to pay as much for the company's stock, which was likely due to the company's losses and the overall economic climate. In addition, the P/E ratio can be affected by a number of other factors, such as the level of competition in the market and the company's growth prospects. Overall, the P/E ratio can be a useful tool for investors, but it's important to consider a variety of factors when analyzing a company's financial performance."

It is calculated by dividing the current market price of the stock by the earnings per share (EPS) of the company. The P/E ratio is important for investors because it can provide insight into the value of a company's stock and the potential for future growth. A high P/E ratio indicates that investors are willing to pay more for the stock, which may suggest that the company has strong growth potential. Conversely, a low P/E ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued and may offer good investment opportunities. It's important to note that the P/E ratio is just one factor to consider when evaluating a company's financial performance and investment potential. Other factors such as the company's industry, competition, and overall economic conditions should also be taken into account."

                    "answer": "The DuPont formula is a financial tool used to assess the overall performance of a company. It is a combination of three key elements: return on equity (ROE), asset turnover (ATO), and financial leverage (FL). The formula is calculated as follows: ROE = Net Income / Total Assets x ATO = Net Sales / Total Assets x FL = Total Assets / Total Equity The DuPont formula helps analysts assess a company's performance by breaking down the components of ROE into two parts: ATO and FL. ATO measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales, while FL measures how much debt a company uses to finance its operations. By analyzing these components, analysts can gain insights into a company's ability to generate profits, manage its assets, and use debt effectively. For example, a company with a high ATO and a low FL may be considered more efficient and less risky than a company with a low ATO and a high FL. Similarly, a company with a high ROE and a high ATO may be considered more profitable than a company with a low ROE and a low ATO. The DuPont formula is a useful tool for analysts because it allows them to assess a company's performance from multiple angles, providing a more complete picture of its financial health."

How much will you need to put away today at 5% interest to have $20,000 a year from now? Essentially, you are trying to determine how much $20,000 one year from now is worth today at 5% interest over the year. To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower or discount the future value back to the current period. The interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the discount rate because it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to the annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this discount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow's cash flow. By changing the FV equation, we can turn into PV = FV / (1 + r)^n where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods. In our example, we know that FV = $20,000, r = 5%, and n = 1. Plugging these values into the equation, we get PV = $20,000 / (1 + 0.05)^1 = $19,047.62.

The Federal Reserve can create money by buying government bonds, securities, and other assets from banks. This process is known as open market operations. When the Federal Reserve buys these assets from banks, it credits the banks' reserve accounts at the Federal Reserve. This credits the banks' reserve accounts with newly created money, which then becomes part of the broader money supply."

However, it can also have the negative effect of increasing the costs of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation. Inflation occurs when the prices of goods and services increase over time. This can erode the purchasing power of money, making it worth less over time.

                    "answer": "The interest-bearing account will be less than the present value because it is not compounded. The future value of an interest-bearing account is the present value plus the interest earned on the present value. Since the interest is not compounded, the interest earned is less than the present value, and therefore, the future value is less than the present value."

                    "answer": "The present value of a future payment will decrease if the discount (or interest) rate used to calculate it increases. This is because the present value is calculated using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, FV is the future value, r is the discount (or interest) rate, and n is the number of periods. As the discount (or interest) rate increases, the present value decreases because the denominator of the formula becomes larger."

                    "answer": "The discount rate required to equate a future payment of $500 in three years to a present value of $400 is 8.8%. This can be calculated using the formula r = (FV / PV)^(1/n) - 1, where r is the discount rate, FV is the future value, PV is the present value, and n is the number of periods. In this case, FV = $500, PV = $400, and n = 3. Plugging these values into the formula gives us r = (500 / 400)^(1/3) - 1 = 0.088 = 8.8%."

                    "answer": "If compounding periods increase in frequency and all else remains the same, the dollar values of any resulting future value calculations will increase. This is because compounding more frequently means that interest is earned on interest, which increases the total amount of interest earned over time. This, in turn, increases the future value of the investment."

This is because money has the ability to earn interest or be invested, and as a result, the value of money increases over time. Therefore, money received in the future is worth less than the same amount received today, because it has not had the opportunity to grow in value through investment or interest. This concept is important in financial planning and decision-making, as it helps individuals and organizations make decisions about when and how to invest their money to maximize its value over time."

The main reason is that an annuity provides a steady stream of income over a period of time, which can be helpful for retirees or others who need a consistent source of income. An annuity also offers the potential for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for investors who want to grow their wealth over time. Additionally, an annuity can provide a death benefit to beneficiaries, which can be important for individuals who want to ensure that their loved ones are taken care of in the event of their death. Finally, an annuity can offer protection against the risk of outliving one's assets, which can be helpful for individuals who want to ensure that they have enough money to last throughout their retirement."

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management.

A bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funding to support operations, to expand, or to purchase major equipment or real property. Bonds are used by businesses, states and local governments, as well as other agencies, who, to some extent, are subject to credit rating agency and market perception of their creditworthiness. A government bond is a debt security issued by a national government to support government spending. Such bonds may be issued by national governments, federal states, or other special jurisdictions. A government bond is a form of debt instrument that is issued by a government to support government spending. The government promises to pay the bond holder, usually at a later date, and to pay periodic interest, called coupons, until maturity. Bonds are used by governments to help finance public projects and by large organizations such as cities and states. Governments issue bonds to raise money for a variety of reasons. The most common reason is to finance a project that will benefit the public, such as building a new road or hospital. Governments also use bonds to pay for day-to-day expenses, such as salaries and operating costs. Bonds are also used to finance debt, such as a loan that a government has taken out to pay for a project. Governments typically issue bonds in denominations of $1,000 or more. Bonds are sold at a discount, which means that the government pays less than the face value of the bond. The government then pays interest on the bond until it matures, which is when the government pays the face value of the bond to the bondholder."

These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice",

The coupon rate of a\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor\npurchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive\n20 coupon payments equal to\nor\nfor a total of $1,000.\nDepending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation\nresulting in significant realized return for the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates.

In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond.

While there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most common are: 1. The potential for capital gains: When a company's stock price increases, the value of your investment also increases. 2. Dividend income: Some companies pay dividends to shareholders, which can provide a steady stream of income. 3. Long-term growth potential: By investing in a company that is growing and expanding, you may be able to benefit from the company's future success."

This\nmeans the DDM is most useful when valuing companies that have long, consistent dividend records.\nIf the DDM formula is applied to a company with a limited dividend history, or in an industry exposed to\nsignificant risks that could affect a company’s ability to maintain its payout, the resulting derived value may\nnot be entirely accurate.\nIn most cases, dividend models, whether constant growth or constant dividend, appeal to a fundamental\nconcept of asset pricing: the future cash flow to which the owner is entitled while holding the asset and the\nrequired rate of return for that cash flow determine the value of a financial asset. However, problems can arise\nwhen using these models because the timing and amounts of future cash flows may be difficult to predict.\n340\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n11.3",

It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. Examples of such companies include Facebook, Amazon,\nGoogle, Biogen, and Monster Beverage. The DCF model differs from the dividend discount models we covered\nearlier, as DDM methodologies are almost entirely based on a stock’s periodic dividends.\nThe DCF model is an absolute valuation model, meaning that it does not involve comparisons with other firms",

Additionally, non-dividend-paying stocks may be more volatile than dividend-paying stocks, which can be appealing to investors who are willing to take on more risk in exchange for the potential for greater returns. However, it's important to note that non-dividend-paying stocks may not be suitable for all investors, and it's important to carefully consider your investment goals and risk tolerance before investing in these types of stocks."

The stock market has grown at an average rate of 10% per year, meaning that $1 invested in 1928 would have grown to $35,000 by mid-2019. This growth is due to a number of factors, including the increasing wealth of the world's population, the growth of the global economy, and the development of new technologies.

                    "answer": "Since 1980, the compound average annual growth rate for large company stocks has been greater than Baa bonds but less than small company stocks. This is because large company stocks have a higher risk than Baa bonds, but a lower risk than small company stocks. The compound average annual growth rate for large company stocks is 15.9%, while the compound average annual growth rate for Baa bonds is 8.8% and the compound average annual growth rate for small company stocks is 8.5%. The higher risk of large company stocks is due to the fact that they are more volatile than Baa bonds and small company stocks. The lower risk of small company stocks is due to the fact that they are less volatile than large company stocks. The compound average annual growth rate is calculated using the following formula: Compound Average Annual Growth Rate = (Ending Value – Beginning Value) / Beginning Value * 100. The ending value for each asset class is calculated using the following formula: Ending Value = Beginning Value * (1 + Compound Average Annual Growth Rate).

                    "answer": "The probability that interest rates will rise over the next year can be calculated using a statistical model. The model will take into account factors such as the current interest rate, the strength of the economy, and the level of inflation. Based on this information, the model will estimate the probability that interest rates will rise over the next year. This probability can then be used to inform a decision on whether to refinance a mortgage. If the probability of interest rates rising is high, then it may be a good idea to refinance the mortgage to take advantage of lower interest rates. On the other hand, if the probability of interest rates rising is low, then it may not be worth the effort to refinance the mortgage."

For example, someone who is risk-averse and is saving for retirement may want to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to bonds, while someone who is more risk-tolerant and is saving for a shorter-term goal may want to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to stocks. The allocation should also be based on the individual's time horizon, as stocks tend to be more volatile in the short term but offer the potential for higher returns over the long term.

One feature of the data\nthat we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that\nyear, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a\nchronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as\nthe decade progresses is called a time series graph.\nTo construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard\nCartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is\nused to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph\ncorrespond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by\nstraight lines in the order in which they occur.\nExample: The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years.

To find the arithmetic mean of the data set, we need to add all the numbers in the data set and divide the sum by the number of numbers in the data set. In this case, the sum of the numbers in the data set is 5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 105. The number of numbers in the data set is 6, so the arithmetic mean is 105/6 = 15.
