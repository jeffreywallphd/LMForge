Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws.

But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v.

We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited).

Although there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most nations do not permit \ntheir judiciaries to declare legislative acts unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently), all \nof them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases, and none of them relies on the comprehensive, \nlegislative codes that are prevalent in civil-law systems. \n \nCivil-Law Systems \nThe main alternative to the common-law legal system was developed in Europe and is based in Roman \nand Napoleonic law. A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal rules are in one or more \ncomprehensive legislative enactments. During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws—a code—\nwas developed for all of France. The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury.

As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978).

In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic.

Describe the various major theories about ethics in human decision making. \n2. Begin considering how the major theories about ethics apply to difficult choices in life and business. \n \n \nThere are several well-respected ways of looking at ethical issues. Some of them have been around for \ncenturies. It is important to know that many who think a lot about business and ethics have deeply held \nbeliefs about which perspective is best. Others would recommend considering ethical problems from a \nvariety of different perspectives. Here, we take a brief look at (1) utilitarianism, (2) deontology, (3) social \njustice and social contract theory, and (4) virtue theory. We are leaving out some important perspectives, \nsuch as general theories of justice and “rights” and feminist thought about ethics and patriarchy. \n \nUtilitarianism \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n50 \nUtilitarianism is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is well aligned with economics and the \nfree-market outlook that has come to dominate much current thinking about business, management, and \neconomics. Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill \n(who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. \nUtilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad",

                    "answer": "The basic principle that forms the basis for my judgment that it was right is the principle of utility. According to this principle, an action is right if it leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. In other words, an action is right if it produces the most good for the most people. In the case of the business organization, the action that was taken was legal but still struck me as wrong because it did not lead to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. The action may have been legal, but it did not produce the most good for the most people, which is the standard by which I judge whether an action is right or wrong."

While this may have been a legal action, I believe it was wrong because it led to the greatest unhappiness for the greatest number of people. The employees who were laid off were likely to be the ones who were most affected by the decision, and they were likely to be the ones who were most affected by the decision. The employees who were laid off were likely to be the ones who were most affected by the decision, and they were likely to be the ones who were most affected by the decision."

The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the",

Shareholders \nelect directors, who then hire officers to manage the company. From this structure, some very basic \nrealities follow. Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers \nhired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are \nnot always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law \nrequire officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the \ncompany. This is the “agency problem” often discussed in corporate governance: how to get officers and \nother top management to align their own interests with those of the shareholders. For example, a CEO \nmight trade insider information to the detriment of the company’s shareholders.

Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response.

Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine.

When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license.

The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves.

Understand the different but complementary roles of state and federal court systems. \n2. Explain why it makes sense for some courts to hear and decide only certain kinds of cases. \n3. Describe the difference between a trial court and an appellate court. \n \n \nAlthough it is sometimes said that there are two separate court systems, the reality is more complex. \nThere are, in fact, fifty-two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court system in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the federal court system. At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states. First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states. Thus a contract dispute resolved by an Arkansas court cannot be relitigated in North \nDakota when the plaintiff wants to collect on the Arkansas judgment in North Dakota. Fourth, state \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n83 \ncourts often must consider the laws of other states in deciding cases involving issues where two \nstates have an interest, such as when drivers from two different states collide in a third state. Under \nthese circumstances, state judges will consult their own state’s case decisions involving conflicts of \nlaws and sometimes decide that they must apply another state’s laws to decide the case (see Table 3.1 \n\"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). \n \nAs state courts are concerned with federal law, so federal courts are often concerned with state law \nand with what happens in state courts.

The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract.

They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital.

Jurisdiction is a \ncombination of two Latin words: juris (law) and diction(to speak). Which court has the power “to \nspeak the law” is the basic question of jurisdiction. \n \nThere are two questions about jurisdiction in each case that must be answered before a judge will \nhear a case: the question of subject matter jurisdiction and the question of personal jurisdiction. \nWe will consider the question of subject matter jurisdiction first, because judges do; if they \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n90 \ndetermine, on the basis of the initial documents in the case (the “pleadings”), that they have no \npower to hear and decide that kind of case, they will dismiss it. \n \nThe Federal-State Balance: Federalism \nState courts have their origins in colonial era courts. After the American Revolution, state courts \nfunctioned (with some differences) much like they did in colonial times. The big difference after 1789 was \nthat state courts coexisted with federal courts. Federalism was the system devised by the nation’s \nfounders in which power is shared between states and the federal government. This sharing requires a \ndivision of labor between the states and the federal government. It is Article III of the US Constitution \nthat spells out the respective spheres of authority (jurisdiction) between state and federal courts. \n \nTake a close look at Article III of the Constitution. (You can find a printable copy of the Constitution \nat http://www.findlaw.com.) Article III makes clear that federal courts are courts of limited power or \njurisdiction. Notice that the only kinds of cases federal courts are authorized to deal with have strong \nfederal connections.

(Most US states’ procedural laws are similar to the federal procedural code.) \n \nOnce at the court, the case will proceed through various motions (motions to dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction, for example, or insufficient service of process), the proofs (submission of evidence), and the \narguments (debate about the meaning of the evidence and the law) of contesting parties. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n99 \nThis is at the heart of the adversary system, in which those who oppose each other may attack the other’s \ncase through proofs and cross-examination. Every person in the United States who wishes to take a case \nto court is entitled to hire a lawyer. The lawyer works for his client, not the court, and serves him as an \nadvocate, or supporter. The client’s goal is to persuade the court of the accuracy and justness of his \nposition. The lawyer’s duty is to shape the evidence and the argument—the line of reasoning about the \nevidence—to advance his client’s cause and persuade the court of its rightness. The lawyer for the \nopposing party will be doing the same thing, of course, for her client. The judge (or, if one is sitting, the \njury) must sort out the facts and reach a decision from this cross-fire of evidence and argument. \n \nThe method of adjudication—the act of making an order or judgment—has several important features. \nFirst, it focuses the conflicting issues. Other, secondary concerns are minimized or excluded altogether. \nRelevance is a key concept in any trial. The judge is required to decide the questions presented at the trial, \nnot to talk about related matters. Second, adjudication requires that the judge’s decision be reasoned, and \nthat is why judges write opinions explaining their decisions (an opinion may be omitted when the verdict \ncomes from a jury). Third, the judge’s decision must not only be reasoned but also be responsive to the \ncase presented: the judge is not free to say that the case is unimportant and that he therefore will ignore it. \nUnlike other branches of government that are free to ignore problems pressing upon them, judges must \ndecide cases.

The judge must pay attention to the parties’ \narguments and his decision must result from their proofs and arguments. Evidence that is not presented \nand legal arguments that are not made cannot be the basis for what the judge decides. Also, judges are \nbound by standards of weighing evidence: the burden of proof in a civil case is generally a “preponderance \nof the evidence.” \n \nIn all cases, the plaintiff—the party making a claim and initiating the lawsuit (in a criminal case the \nplaintiff is the prosecution)—has the burden of proving his case. If he fails to prove it, the defendant—the \nparty being sued or prosecuted—will win. \nCriminal prosecutions carry the most rigorous burden of proof: the government must prove its case \nagainst the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, even if it seems very likely that the defendant \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n100 \ncommitted the crime, as long as there remains some reasonable doubt—perhaps he was not clearly \nidentified as the culprit, perhaps he has an alibi that could be legitimate—the jury must vote to acquit \nrather than convict. \n \nBy contrast, the burden of proof in ordinary civil cases—those dealing with contracts, personal injuries, \nand most of the cases in this book—is a preponderance of the evidence, which means that the plaintiff’s \nevidence must outweigh whatever evidence the defendant can muster that casts doubts on the plaintiff’s \nclaim. This is not merely a matter of counting the number of witnesses or of the length of time that they \ntalk: the judge in a trial without a jury (a bench trial), or the jury where one is impaneled, must apply the \npreponderance of evidence test by determining which side has the greater weight of credible, relevant \nevidence. \n \nAdjudication and the adversary system imply certain other characteristics of courts. Judges must be \nimpartial; those with a personal interest in a matter must refuse to hear it. The ruling of a court, after all \nappeals are exhausted, is final.

Often this is not a problem; you \nmight be suing a person who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state. Or a nonresident \nmay answer your complaint without objecting to the court’s “in personam” (personal) jurisdiction. But \nmany defendants who do not reside in the state where the lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the \ninconvenience of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum.

If a plaintiff sues five defendants and the court has personal jurisdiction over just one, the case \ncan be heard, but the court cannot make a judgment against the other four. \n1. \nBut if the plaintiff loses against defendant 1, he can go elsewhere (to another state or \nstates) and sue defendants 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n2. The court’s decision in the first lawsuit (against defendant 1) does not determine the \nliability of the nonparticipating defendants. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n103 \nThis involves the principle of res judicata, which means that you can’t bring the same action \nagainst the same person (or entity) twice. It’s like the civil side of double jeopardy. Res means \n“thing,” and judicata means “adjudicated.” Thus the “thing” has been “adjudicated” and \nshould not be judged again. But, as to nonparticipating parties, it is not over. If you have \na different case against the same defendant—one that arises out of a completely different \nsituation—that case is not barred by res judicata. \n3.

For example, Kumar Patel (a Missouri resident) opens a brokerage account with \nGoldman, Sachs and Co., and the contractual agreement calls for “any disputes arising under this \nagreement” to be determined “according to the laws of the state of New York.” When Kumar claims in a \nMissouri court that his broker is “churning” his account, and, on the other hand, Goldman, Sachs claims \nthat Kumar has failed to meet his margin call and owes $38,568.25 (plus interest and attorney’s fees), the \njudge in Missouri will apply New York law based on the contract between Kumar and Goldman, Sachs. \n \nOrdinarily, a choice-of-law clause will be accompanied by a choice-of-forum clause.

The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years. Depositions can consume days or even weeks of an executive’s time. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nMany cases never get to trial.

The judge presides, instructs the \njury, and may limit who testifies and what they testify about what. In all of this, the judge will usually commit \nsome errors; occasionally these will be the kinds of errors that seriously compromise a fair trial for both \nparties. Errors that do seriously compromise a fair trial for both parties are prejudicial, as opposed to \nharmless. The appeals court must decide whether any errors of the trial court judge are prejudicial or not. \nIf a judge directs a verdict, that ends the case for the party who hasn’t asked for one; if a judge grants \njudgment n.o.v., that will take away a jury verdict that one side has worked very hard to get. Thus a judge \nmust be careful not to unduly favor one side or the other, regardless of his or her sympathies. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What if there was not a doctrine of res judicata?

After reading the briefs on appeal, the appellate court may dispose of the appeal without \nargument, issuing a written opinion that may be very short or many pages. Often, though, the appellate \ncourt will hear oral argument. (This can be months, or even more than a year after the briefs are filed.) \nEach lawyer is given a short period of time, usually no more than thirty minutes, to present his client’s \ncase.

Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts. \n2. Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n121 \n \n \nAlmost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney. But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue?

But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave.

Understand the various ways that lawyers charge for services. \n2. Describe the contingent fee system in the United States. \n3. Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n \nLegal Fees \nLawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. \nA flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance \napproximately how long it will take her to do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are \nexamples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the \nworth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price. \n \nLawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial \nmatters. Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range \nfrom $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time. \n \nA contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the \nsuccess of the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., \nautomobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite often, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n125 \ncontingent fee is controversial. Trial lawyers justify it by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such \nlawsuits. A typical automobile accident case can cost at least ten thousand dollars to prepare, and a \ncomplicated products-liability case can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Few people have that kind of \nmoney or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit.

The book is\ndesigned for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as\nsecond-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences\nand course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the\nintroduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and\nPreface\n1\neconomics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial\ntheory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more\nrigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical\ncalculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.\nPedagogical Foundation\nPrinciples of Finance emphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business\nfunctions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates\na unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This\nmultifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.\nTheoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are\nintroduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.\nIn order to create meaning for all students, Principles of Finance exposes them to a range of companies,\nindustries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,\nand American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that\nmay be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,\nsmall business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews\ninclude diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.\nProblems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and\ncontexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students.

They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial",

                    "answer": "Financial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions required to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners. These could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store, partners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning helps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans typically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion."

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short.

Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective.

Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC).

In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities.

Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\n7\nUnited States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\n23\nHowever, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual\nfirm and industry forecasts. Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services.

They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete.

Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of\nconsumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like\nthis: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment\nadviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my\ninvestments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13\nmillion!”\nAn important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and\nlong-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be\navailable? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?\nWhen saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of\ncompounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low\ntolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start\na holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you\nhave funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.\nAn intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation\nhome. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment\nreturns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term\ninvestments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.\nLong-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and\nthe luxury of compounded returns over a long period.

Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634.

In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts\ngreater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments.

Accountants\ntrack, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present\nare “book values” and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”\nMarket values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset.

One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\n2.1\nBusiness Structures\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the business form created by most organizations.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\n•\nList and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized.

If the organization loses the lawsuit, the sole proprietor is personally responsible for paying the $500,000. \n2. There are limited opportunities for raising capital. Sole proprietors must use their own money or borrow from personal resources, such as a home equity loan. \n3. There is a limited life for the business. Sole proprietorships are considered to be the same legal entity as the owner. Therefore, when the owner dies or decides to stop the business, the sole proprietorship ceases to exist. \n4. There is a limited ability to attract talented employees. It is difficult to attract talented employees to work for a small business. Many talented employees prefer to work for larger companies with more resources and opportunities for advancement."

However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.",

First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships.

In order to begin the process of\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\narticles of incorporation include the following:\n•\nDomestic corporation (in state)\n•\nForeign corporation (out of state or out of country)\n•\nClose (closely held) corporation\n•\nProfessional corporation\n•\nNonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\n•\nStock corporation\n•\nNon-stock corporation\n•\nPublic benefit corporation\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\n2.2\nRelationship between Shareholders and Company Management\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between principals and agents.\n•",

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid.

In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors.

It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits.

In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors.

                    "answer": "It is considered a corporate governance best practice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held companies because independent directors bring a fresh perspective to the table and are less likely to be influenced by the company's management or other stakeholders. Independent directors are not affiliated with the company in any way, so they are able to provide objective advice and make decisions based on what is best for the company as a whole. This is particularly important for publicly traded companies, where shareholders have a right to know that the board is acting in their best interests. For privately held companies, independent directors can help ensure that the company is being managed in a responsible and ethical manner, and that any decisions made are in the best interests of all stakeholders."

This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate\nactions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,\nand ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\nInvestors versus Creditors\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\npossible default.\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\nstakeholders of the company.

Whether to release financial information, unveil new products or services, announce changes in management, or a host of other reasons, all communications have a different objective. Not all press releases are created equally, and they have varying degrees of effectiveness. Any press release should contain information in easy-to-understand language that is free of corporate jargon and as concise as possible. Press releases may be viewed by multiple audiences, such as customers, stakeholders, investors, potential investors, and the general public, which is vital to consider when drafting a press release. According to PR Newswire statistics, press releases that contain multimedia content have been known to substantially increase press release views.5 Using infographics and charts where possible and relaying the key messages in a press release are important factors in ensuring the success of a press release."

Corporate governance helps to minimize agency problems by setting up a system of checks and balances that ensures that managers are accountable to the shareholders.

If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price.

The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for\nsweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30. At a price of $30, the quantity demanded of 20 sweatshirts\nequals the quantity supplied of 20 sweatshirts.\nFigure 3.6 Graph of Demand and Supply for Sweatshirts\nChanges in Equilibrium Price\nA price that is either too high (above the equilibrium price) or too low (below the equilibrium price) is not\nsustainable in a competitive market. Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either\nsupply or demand changes.\nIf supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as in Figure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will\nfall.

In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement an increase in quantity demanded.\nDistinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an\nincrease in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.\nEquilibrium price will also fall if demand falls.

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls.

You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n77\ndelivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows\neconomists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a\ntypical family’s purchases.\nIn an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods\npurchased and the purchasing habits of families, Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon founded the Billion\nPrices Project. Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world. The Billion Prices Project website\n(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project) provides measures for inflation using this data as well as\nresearch papers regarding macroeconomic research.\nHistorical Trends in the Inflation Rate\nInflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed in Figure 3.10. The graph shows that for the past\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.",

The concepts of supply, demand, and equilibrium apply in this\nmarket just as they do in other markets. This market is referred to as the market for loanable funds.\nIn the market for loanable funds, the suppliers of funds are economic entities that currently have a surplus in\ntheir budget. In other words, they have more income than they currently want to spend; they would like to\nsave some of their money and spend it in future time periods. Instead of just putting these savings in a box on\na shelf for safekeeping until they want to spend it, they can let someone else borrow that money. In essence,\nthey are renting that money to someone else, who pays a rental price called the interest rate.\nThe suppliers of loanable funds, also known as lenders, are represented by the upward-sloping curve in Figure\n3.17. A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\nborrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At that\ninterest rate, the quantity supplied of loanable funds exactly equals the quantity demanded of loanable funds.",

If you want to borrow money to purchase a\ncar and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.\nOr suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing",

This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\n3.4 • Interest Rates\n87",

As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\nexposure.

                    "answer": "An index is a statistical measure that is used to track the performance of a particular aspect of the economy or the financial markets. An index helps compare the level of a variable at one point in time relative to another point in time. Indexes are often used when movement over time is more important than the absolute level of the variable at any one point in time. For example, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an index that is used to measure the rate of inflation. The CPI is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods. When the index is created, the total cost of the market basket, whether it is $300 or $950, is irrelevant. What economists are interested in is the magnitude of the difference in cost of the same market basket at a later date. In order to focus on the change over time, a base year is identified. The cost of the market basket in the base year is given an index level of 100. Let's assume that the market basket costs $300 in the base year. If the same basket of goods costs $330 the following year, then the index level the following year would be 110. The index level increases by 10% when the cost of the market basket increases by 10%. This makes it easy to compare different measures of inflation. For example, suppose a market basket costs 40,000 yen in the first year and 42,000 yen in the second year. In the first year, the index level would be 100. In the second year, the index level would be 105. This indicates that the cost of the market basket increased by 5% from the first year to the second year."

This makes it easy to compare\ndifferent measures of inflation.\nFor example, suppose a market basket costs 40,000 yen in the first year and 42,000 yen in the second year. In\nthe base year, the CPI in Japan would be set at 100; the following year, the index would rise to 105 (because of\nthe 5% rise in the market basket cost). Comparing the levels of the index in Japan with the index in the United\nStates allows you to compare inflation trends in the two countries.\nTable 3.6 contains the CPI for the United States, Japan, and Switzerland for each decade since 1970. A base year\nof 1970 is used for all three countries, so the index level is 100 for all three countries in 1970. You can see that\nJapan has experienced virtually no inflation for the last several decades. If the index level remains the same\nfrom one year to the next, there is a zero rate of inflation.

Although prices in\nSwitzerland rose much more slowly in the 1970s, the price level continued to rise over the next couple of\ndecades. Even though the price increases have followed different patterns in Switzerland and Japan, the\noverall price level today is about three times what it was in 1970 in both of those countries. However, the price\nlevel in the United States has continued to rise; today, the price level in the United States is about seven times\nhigher than it was in in the 1970s.\n15\nData from US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in US City Average\n(CPIAUCNS).” FRED.

Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\nCash-Basis Accounting\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris",

For example, as you saw above, Chris\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\n102\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexpense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\nWho Uses Each Method?\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is",

In this section you will explore the impact business transactions have on\nfinancial statements under each method. In doing so, you’ll be introduced to double-entry accounting and\nsee how it functions to support the accounting equation.\nTiming of Business Activity versus Cash Flow\nThe first financial statement prepared is the income statement, a statement that shows the organization’s\nfinancial performance for a given period of time. We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a\nsummer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used\nthe cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was\nusing her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance\ncosts. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.\nThis balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and\ninsurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)",

While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\n104\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSeptember rather than in August. In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,\na result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\nThe Accounting Equation\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance.

First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\ndegree pursued.\nSolution:\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization.

It is helpful to also think of net worth as the\naccounting value of the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and\nservices) increase the accounting value of the organization. So every dollar of revenue an organization\ngenerates increases the overall value of the organization.\n4.2 • Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\n105\nLikewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue) decrease the value of the organization. So\neach dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization. The same\napproach can be taken with the other elements of the financial statements:\n•\nGains increase the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nLosses decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nInvestments by owners increase the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nDistributions to owners decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nChanges in assets and liabilities can either increase or decrease the value (equity) of the organization\ndepending on the net result of the transaction.\nLet’s look at Chris’s Landscaping business again and do the same quick exercise you did with your personal\nfinances. If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s\ntractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset. Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash\nfor all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0.

The American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\nrevenue recognition.\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until\ncustomer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you\nrecognize revenue?\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\ngovernment.\nExpense Recognition\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers.

                    "answer": "Revenue recognition is the process of recognizing revenue when it is earned, while expense recognition is the process of recognizing expenses when they are incurred. Revenue recognition is based on the concept of accrual accounting, which recognizes revenue when it is earned, regardless of when cash is received. Expense recognition is based on the concept of cash basis accounting, which recognizes expenses when cash is paid. Both revenue and expense recognition are important concepts in accounting and finance, as they help to accurately reflect the financial position of a business."

Tangible assets can be either short term, such as inventory and supplies, or long term,\nsuch as land, buildings, and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset, the item needs to be\nused in the normal operation of the business for more than one year, be of material value, and not be near the\nend of its useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item in the near future. The useful life is\nthe time period over which an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known as fixed assets. It’s\nalso key to note that companies will capitalize a fixed asset if they have material value. A $10 stapler to be\nused in the office, for example, may last for years, but the value of the item is not significant enough to\nwarrant capitalizing it.\nBusinesses typically need many different types of these assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ\nfrom the company’s products. For example, the computers that Apple, Inc. intends to sell are considered\ninventory (a short-term asset), whereas the computers Apple’s employees use for day-to-day operations are\nlong-term assets. In Liam’s case, the new silk screen machine would be considered a long-term tangible asset\nas they plan to use it over many years to help generate revenue for their business. Long-term tangible assets\nare listed as noncurrent assets on a company’s balance sheet. Typically, these assets are listed under the\ncategory of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as fixed assets or plant assets.\nApple, Inc. lists a total of $36.766 million in total Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) on its September 2020\nconsolidated balance sheet (see Figure 4.7).

Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years.

If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\ntypically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense.

It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\naccounting courses. Note that these methods are for accounting and reporting purposes. The IRS allows firms\nto use the same or different methods to depreciate assets in calculating taxable income.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFixed Assets\nYou work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a\nproduction and warehouse facility in Pennsylvania.

                    "answer": "Depreciation expense is the portion of the cost of a physical asset that is consumed during a period. It is a non-cash expense that is used to reduce the book value of a tangible asset, such as equipment, furniture, or a building. Depreciation expense is recorded in the income statement and is calculated based on the asset's original cost, its estimated useful life, and its estimated salvage value. The expense is recorded over the life of the asset, typically through a depreciation schedule, and is used to allocate the cost of the asset over its useful life."

It is a contra account that is recorded as a reduction in the asset's carrying value, and it is used to track the decline in the asset's value over time. Accumulated depreciation is calculated by multiplying the depreciation expense by the number of periods the asset has been in use. It is recorded on the balance sheet as a deduction from the asset's carrying value, and it is used to determine the asset's net book value."

This is because\nthe expense would have been $5,011.20, and since we cannot depreciate the asset below the estimated\nsalvage value of $10,000, the expense cannot exceed $2,528, which is the amount left to depreciate (difference\nbetween the book value of $12,528 and the salvage value of $10,000). Since the asset has been depreciated to\nits salvage value at the end of year four, no depreciation can be taken in year five.\nIn our example, the first year’s double-declining-balance depreciation expense would be\n. For the remaining years, the double-declining percentage is multiplied by the\nremaining book value of the asset.

The net effect of the differences in straight-line\ndepreciation versus double-declining-balance depreciation is that under the double-declining-balance method,\nthe allowable depreciation expenses are greater in the earlier years than those allowed for straight-line\ndepreciation.

However, “management teams typically fail to invest either time or attention into\nmaking or periodically revisiting and revising reasonably supportable estimates of asset lives or salvage\nvalues, or the selection of depreciation methods, as prescribed by GAAP.”5 This failure is not an ethical\napproach to properly accounting for the use of assets.\nAccountants need to analyze depreciation of an asset over the entire useful life of the asset. As an asset\nsupports the cash flow of the organization, expensing its cost needs to be allocated, not just recorded as an\narbitrary calculation. An asset’s depreciation may change over its life according to its use. If asset depreciation\nis arbitrarily determined, the recorded “gains or losses on the disposition of depreciable property assets seen\nin financial statements”6 are not true best estimates. Due to operational changes, the depreciation expense\nneeds to be periodically reevaluated and adjusted.\nAny mischaracterization of asset usage is not proper GAAP and is not proper accrual accounting. Therefore,\n“financial statement preparers, as well as their accountants and auditors, should pay more attention to the\nquality of depreciation-related estimates and their possible mischaracterization and losses of credits and\ncharges to operations as disposal gains.”7 An accountant should always follow GAAP guidelines and allocate",

In accounting it is common to present net income in the following format:\nRecall that revenue is the value of goods and services a business provides to its customers and increases the\nvalue of the business.

While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings.

Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses.

Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don't normally do (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It's key to note that the timing of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not necessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out."

The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake\nSporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid\nout in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\nearnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced\nretained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning\nbalance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of\ntheir earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.\nFigure 5.10 Statement of Retained Earnings",

The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable? Again, the answer is no.\nRemember, the accounting equation rests on the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. This",

Common stockholders normally have voting rights.\nPreferred stock has unique rights that are “preferred,” or more advantageous, to shareholders than common\nstock. Unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights and do not\nshare in the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the “preferred” classification entitles shareholders\nto a dividend that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared). Treasury stock is shares that were\noutstanding and have been repurchased by the firm but not retired. Thus they are still issued, but not\noutstanding. Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and par value of the common\nstock. For example, if a firm issued and sold stock at a market price of $20 that had a $5 par value, $5 for each\nshare would be recorded into common stock and the excess $15 per share would be recorded into the\nadditional paid-in capital account.\nIf we review the balance sheet for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see just two elements of equity: common\nstock and retained earnings.

They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n143\nconsumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect. FASB (Financial Accounting\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\nfixed assets). Finally, financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business (loans, interest).",

The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash.

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task.

A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements.

They can also look at the percentage for each expense over time to see if they are\nspending more or less on certain areas of the business, such as research and development.

They\ncan also quickly see the percentage of current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities.\nIn Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement for the current and prior years, we can see that\ncost of goods as a percentage of sales remained the same (see Figure 5.24).

Apple’s MD&A reported significant updates on the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a few financial updates, product updates, segment performance data, a conversation\nabout its debt, contractual obligations, and accounting policies.\nSEC Reporting Requirements\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded firms to regularly provide several\nreports. The two most common are the 10-K and quarterly report (10-Q). Certain unique events also require an\nadditional filing called an 8-K. There are many events that might require reporting. A few key examples include\nchanges to rights of shareholders, changes in control of the company, and amendments to the company",

                    "answer": "A fiscal year is a 12-month period that a company uses for accounting purposes to keep track of its financials. A calendar year is the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31. Companies can choose to use a fiscal year that does not match the calendar year. For example, the fiscal year for Apple Inc. is from October 1 to September 30. This means that Apple's fiscal year 2021 ends on September 30, 2021."

The report typically includes financial statements, such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, as well as a management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section that provides a narrative explanation of the company's financial performance."

Beginning balances are provided, and all key\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\nneeds for growth.\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.\n5.8 Reporting Financial Activity\nPublicly traded firms must file company and financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\non a regular basis.

It differs\ndepending on the role and perspective of those performing the analysis. For example, your personal\naccountant will have different goals and needs in making recommendations to you about your personal\nfinances. All accounting professionals use financial analysis to check for validity, accurate data, compliance in\nreporting, and more.\nSome tactics for managing your personal finances can be the same as for managing business finances. For\nexample, reducing expenses and maximizing returns on long-term investments are always good practices.\nDebt can also be a beneficial tool in both personal and professional finances when used appropriately. Debt is\nneither inherently good nor bad; it simply needs to be properly managed in order to achieve a reasonable\nreturn in exchange for the cost and risk it poses.\nThough the process and tools may be similar, financial analysis from a business perspective has different goals\nand needs.

One of these roles is that of a financial\nanalyst. The skills and qualifications of a financial analyst vary widely from one industry to another, but\nthere are a number of similarities in individuals who hold these roles. As you watch the video about\nfinancial analysts (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-financial-analysts), consider your own career path\nand how your skills, abilities, and interests may fit this role.\n6.1\nRatios: Condensing Information into Smaller Pieces\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the importance of financial statement analysis in making informed decisions about business\nopportunities.\n•\nOutline the limitations of financial statement analysis in making investment decisions.\nWhen considering the outcomes from analysis, it is important for a company to understand that the data\ngenerated needs to be compared to similar data within the industry at large as well as that of close\ncompetitors. The company should also consider its past experience and how it corresponds to current and\nfuture performance expectations.\nImportance of Ratios and Analysis\nFinancial ratios help internal and external stakeholders make informed decisions about actions like investing,\nbecoming a supplier, making a loan, or altering internal operations, among other things. The information\nresulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success,\nset budget expectations, and compare industry competitors. There are four main types of ratios: liquidity,\nsolvency, efficiency, and profitability.

Examples of the most liquid assets include\ncash, accounts receivable, and inventory for merchandising or manufacturing businesses. The reason these\nare among the most liquid assets is that these assets will be turned into cash more quickly than land or\nbuildings, for example. Accounts receivable represents goods or services that have already been sold and will\ntypically be paid/collected within 30 to 45 days.\nInventory is less liquid than accounts receivable because the product must first be sold before it generates\ncash (either through a cash sale or sale on account). Inventory is, however, more liquid than land or buildings\nbecause, under most circumstances, it is easier and quicker for a business to find someone to purchase its\ngoods than it is to find a buyer for land or buildings.\nCurrent Ratio\nThe current ratio is closely related to working capital; it represents the current assets divided by current\nliabilities.

During the year, the company also declared a $5,000 dividend on preferred\nstock and a $6,000 dividend on common stock. The company had 8,000 common shares outstanding the entire\nyear. Clear Lake Sporting Goods has generated $3.75 of earnings ($35,000 less the $5,000 of preferred\ndividends) for each of the 8,000 common shares of stock it has outstanding.\nMeasuring Performance with Earnings per Share\nEarnings per share is a key profitability measure that both current and potential common stockholders\nmonitor. Its importance is accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies to report earnings per\nshare on the face of a company’s income statement. This is the only ratio that requires such prominent\nreporting. If fact, public companies are required to report two different earnings per share amounts on their\nincome statements—basic and diluted. We’ve illustrated the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted\nearnings per share, which is not demonstrated here, involves the consideration of all securities, such as stocks\nand bonds, that could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic earnings per share.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFinding Earning per Share for Public Companies\nWhere can you find earnings per share information on public companies?

The company\nneeds to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,\ncompany revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:\nprofit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.\nProfit Margin\nProfit margin represents how much of sales revenue has translated into income.

In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value\ntomorrow.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will\npay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year\nfrom now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\nturns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is\n$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that\ntime. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the\nprincipal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\nBy taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a\ntotal value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to\n$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that\n$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss\ninterest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can\nconsider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds\nand/or charged to the borrower of these same funds.

Unfortunately, you\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\ncost after six years?\nSolution:\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\nvalue of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn\nor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of\nor $105, in the account at the end of one\nyear.\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\nand five?\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n195\nUsing the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:\nHow the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding\nMelvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in\ninterest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future.

These will be covered in Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments.\nFuture Value (FV)\nThe Future Value function in Excel is also referred to as FV and can be used to calculate the value of a single\nlump sum amount carried to any point in the future. The FV function syntax is similar to that of the other four\nbasic time-value functions and has the following inputs (referred to as arguments), similar to the functions\nlisted above:\nLump sum problems do not involve payments, so the value of Pmt in such calculations is 0.

How much will you need to put away today at 5% interest to have $20,000 a year from now?\nEssentially, you are trying to determine how much $20,000 one year from now is worth today at 5% interest\nover the year. To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower or discount the future value\nback to the current period.\nThe interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the\ndiscount rate because it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to\nthe annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this\ndiscount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing\nthe FV equation, we can turn\ninto\nwhich is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest\nfactor (PVIF). The PVIF is simply the reciprocal of the FVIF, which makes sense because these factors are doing\nexactly opposite things.

If the government is currently paying 5% per year on savings bonds, how much will\nit cost you today to buy this savings bond?\nThe $1,000 face value of the bond is the future value, and the number of years n that Charlotte must wait to\nget this face value is 30 years.

In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\nrate.

By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n219\ntake the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\nNow, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in\n, or 36, years. However, if the rate of\ngrowth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in\n, or 6.55, years. By performing such\ncalculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\ngrowth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation\nand development.\nIt is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings\namounts that are earning interest.\nTo apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers\nwould lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in\n, or about 10.3,\nyears.\nIn an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of\n24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\nyou owe to the credit card company will double in only\n, or 3, years.\nSo, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage\npoint in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic\nforecasting models.",

A good\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in\nor\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only\n, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\nInvesting and Risk\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.\nRisk and return are the factors that will cause a rational person to believe that a dollar risked should end up\nearning more than that single dollar.\nTo summarize, the concept of the time value of money and the related TVM formulas are extremely important\nbecause they can be used in different circumstances to help investors and savers understand the value of their\nmoney today relative to its earning potential in the future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that\ninflation has on your money and why saving your money early can help increase the value of your savings",

For example, if the interest rate is 6%, the rule of 72 would estimate that it will take 12 years for the money to double.

The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\nThe idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.\nTVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the\nfuture. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money\nearly can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects\nof inflation.

Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity?

Assume\nthat we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at the end of each year for five years, earning 7%\ncompounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\ninterest from past periods.\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we\ndeposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the\nbeginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at\nthe end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity.

It’s important to note that rounding differences can\nbecome significant when dealing with larger multipliers, as in the financing of a multimillion-dollar machine or\nfacility. In this text, we will ignore them.\nIn conclusion, five payments of $25,000, or $125,000 in total, can be funded today with $99,817.81, with the\ndifference being obtained from interest always accumulating on the remaining balance at 8%. The running\nbalance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and\nsubtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year.

The reason is that you can’t\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\nmoney.

That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as\ntaxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.\n8.2 • Annuities\n233\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nEarlier, we defined an ordinary annuity. A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,",

Therefore, the amount only\ncompounds for four years rather than five. Also, our fifth payment is not made until the last day of our\ncontract in year 5, so it has no chance to earn a compounded future value. The investor has lost on both ends.\nIn the table above, we have made five calculations, and for a longer-term contract such as 10, 25, or 40 years,\nthis would be tedious. Fortunately, as with present values, this ordinary annuity can be solved in one step\nbecause all payments are identical.\nRepeating the formula, and then by substitution:\nThis proof emphasizes that year 1 is wasted, with no compounding because the payment is made on the last\nday of year 1 rather than immediately. We lose compounding through this ordinary annuity in another way:\nyear 5’s investment is made on the last day of this five-year contract and has no chance to accumulate interest.\nA more intuitive method would be to enter a contract for an annuity due so that our first payment can be\nmade immediately. In this way, we don’t waste the first year, and all five payments work in year 5 as well. As\nstated previously, this means that annuities due will yield larger results than ordinary annuities, whether one is\ndiscounting (PVa) or compounding (FVa).\nLet’s hold all facts constant with the previous example, except that we will invest at the beginning of each year,\nstarting immediately upon locking in this five-year contract. We follow the same technique as in the present\nvalue section: we multiply by one additional period to convert this ordinary annuity factor into a factor for an\nannuity due. Whether one is solving for a future value or a present value, the result of an annuity due must\nalways be larger than an ordinary annuity.

Additional requests from the same company require a small fee.\n•\nAn unsecured personal loan is an installment loan, initially drawn for a fixed amount and repaid on a\nperiodic schedule with interest, as we have seen in our annuity examples. Unsecured means that the loan\nis not secured by collateral but is instead based on the strong credit history of the borrower.\n•\nIn contrast, a secured personal loan has an asset backing up the unpaid amount, and if the consumer\ndefaults on the debt, the asset can be seized by the lender to satisfy their claim. A common example is an\nauto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the\nborrower’s car being repossessed.\n•\nA mortgage loan is another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even\n30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the\nborrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance\nremains on the debt.\n•\nStudent loans are borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a\nfinancial institution or the federal government. Interest rates on these loans are generally low and\nadvantageous, and repayment does not begin until after the borrower’s education is complete (or if they\ndrop below a certain level of time status, such as becoming a half-time student).\nCalculating Loan Payments Using Simple Amortization\nLoan amortization refers to a schedule of how and when a debt will be repaid with interest. As noted, we will\nfocus on fixed-rate debts, such as auto loans, personal loans with installment payments, or mortgages. Before\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into\nbusiness or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area of Time Value of Money I.\nWe’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a\nmonthly basis. Fortunately, our formulas are easily adjusted from annual to non-annual periods. You will recall\nthat we solve for non-annual periods in the same way, with two adjustments: (1) we divide the annual interest",

In addition, the debt is decreasing slowly in the early months and more rapidly in the later\n8.3 • Loan Amortization\n241\nmonths. We can all agree that lenders are compensated for the risks they take earlier rather than later. Of the\n36 payments of $973.50, $32,000 has been repaid as the principal borrowed. The remaining $3,046.08 is the\nlender’s revenue, the cost of credit.\nFor an additional example, one that drives home the point that more interest is paid in the early months of a\nlong-term loan, we will consider a 20-year home mortgage. Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance. Let’s assume you buy a $200,000 home, pay $60,000 as a cash deposit, and will finance the\nremaining $140,000 over 20 years. The bank offers you a 3.6% annual interest rate. What will the amount of\nyour monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s\nprove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of\nan annuity formula. Remember that you are not financing the entire $200,000 purchase; you pay $60,000 in\ncash, so you are only financing the remaining $140,000.\nWe modify the periods from years to months by multiplying by 12, and we modify the annual rate to a monthly\nrate by dividing by 12, resulting in\nBy substitution into the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe divide both sides by 170.907667 to isolate the payment amount (PYMT):",

Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore\nthis bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to\ncompound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (see Table 8.6).\nMonth Interest Balance\n1,000.00\n1\n15.00 1,015.00\n2\n15.23 1,030.23\n3\n15.45 1,045.69\n4\n15.69 1,061.36\n5",

The following Thursday, the borrower is expected to pay\noff the advance, and if they do not, the lender can deposit the postdated check. If that check has insufficient\nfunds, more fees and penalties will likely be assessed.\nOne primary reason that arrangements such as these are controversial is the excessively high nominal (stated)\ninterest rate that they can represent.

Assume no compounding during those\nfour weeks.\nSolution:\nA weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use\nof $800. Of course, that totals 2% of the amount advanced. There are 13 four-week periods in a year, so\neven though the interest rate appears to be small, it amounts to 26% when annualized!

Most of the calculations in this chapter were prepared\nwith Excel.\nThe boxes in the Excel gridwork, known individually as cells (located at the intersection of a column and a row),\ncan contain numbers, text, and very powerful formulas (or functions) for calculations and data analytics. Cells,\nrows, columns, and groups of cells (ranges) are easily moved, formatted, and replicated. In the mortgage\namortization table for 240 months seen in Section 8.3.2, only the formulas for month 1 were typed in. With one\nsimple command, that row of formulas was replicated 239 more times, with each line updating itself with\nrelevant number adjustments automatically. With some practice, a long table such as that can be constructed\nby even a relatively new user in less than 10 minutes.\nIn this section, we will illustrate how to use Excel to solve problems from earlier in the chapter, including\nperpetuities, ordinary annuities, effective interest rates, and loan amortization.

Second, the actual effect function\nin C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the word rate because we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so\nExcel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9, rate\nremains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.\nTo assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the\nanchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we\nuse the name rate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place\nthe cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the\ncurrent cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then\nhit the enter key, the value in that box will change to rate. Now, if you type “rate” (again, without quotation\nmarks) into a formula, Excel knows to use the contents of cell B3.",

Preferred stock is a common example with a preestablished\ndividend formula. An indefinite stream of payments cannot be compounded into a future value, but it can be\ndiscounted to a present value, providing an opportunity to determine the amount an investor should be\nwilling to pay for a share of that stock.\n8.2 Annuities\nAn annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments that is expected to be paid or received. Calculations of future\nvalue or present value are commonly performed on these payment streams for a wide number of reasons in\nbusiness and personal financial analysis, as seen in the chapter focusing on single amounts, particularly in\nloan repayment. Annuities may be ordinary annuities, in which the first cash flow of a series occurs at the end\nof the first period, or annuities due, if the first cash flow occurs at the beginning point of the first period.\n8.3 Loan Amortization\nLoans are contracts between a lender and a borrower. Failure to observe the rules of that contract, such as\npayment of interest or repayment of the amount owed, can subject the borrower to substantial penalties as\nwell as damage to their credit. Loan agreements bearing a fixed rate of interest have a scheduled\namortization, or rate and time of repayments with interest. Several types of business and personal loans were\ndescribed.\n8.4 Stated versus Effective Rates\nFor a borrower to understand the true cost of financing, they must be familiar with interannual compounding,\nwhich can cause a stated interest rate that appears to be annual to actually be higher. The effective rate of\ninterest was demonstrated to understand that true cost.\n8.5 Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\nThe use of two tools for managing and understanding the time value of money and its many applications was\ndiscussed: a professional financial calculator and the popular Microsoft Office Suite spreadsheet application\nExcel.\nKey Terms\nannuity",

But a\nprofessional decision maker must “hit it out of the park” when making major capital investment choices and\nrecommendations.\nAs a student in a course of business studies and career development, it is highly likely that you will be a\ndecision maker about projects that are likely to generate future cash flows but will also require a large initial\nexpense. When you ask your manager to invest $500,000 or more in a new piece of equipment that could help\nyour department meet or exceed its goals, you must be prepared to defend your request. Competing\nmanagers and departments will be asking for similar funding, and there simply might not be enough for\neveryone. This decision process requires financial analysis.\nMark Cuban of Shark Tank fame enjoys citing the series’ catchphrase: “Know thy numbers.” As a business\nprofessional, you must be able to assess potential profit against expenditures to be successful. In most cases,\nthis is based on our understanding of cash flow. A major capital investment might seem initially like a gamble,\nbut it is a gamble that can be hedged in your favor with understanding, analysis, and knowledge of your\nnumbers.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to give you information and instruction on how this is done.

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions.

Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•",

These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING",

Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors.

The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase.

This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\ncompared to stocks.\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n291\nWhile yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are\ncurrently low because the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) has kept interest rates low for several years,\ninvestors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.2 This is especially true as investors enter their\nretirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks. Because income from most bonds is fixed, such instruments can have\ntheir values eroded by external factors such as interest rates and inflation.

The most common and best-known\nrisks are interest rate risk and default risk, but other risks exist that should be understood. Among these\nrisks are the following:\n•\nCredit risk. If investors believe that a bond issuer is unlikely to meet its payment commitments, they may\ndemand a higher yield to purchase the bond issue in the first place. Due to the relative stability of\ngovernments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.\n•\nLiquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\n•\nDuration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n301\n•\nCall risk and reinvestment risk.

In general, the higher the credit rating of the issuer, the lower the default risk. Similarly, industries that are more stable and less subject to economic fluctuations will have lower default risk than industries that are more volatile. Finally, countries with strong and stable economies will have lower default risk than countries with weaker and more volatile economies."

Reinvestment risk is defined as the risk to investors\nwhen they find themselves facing unfavorable alternatives for investing the proceeds from their called\nbonds in new, lower-paying investments. This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\noriginal bond investors.\n•\nTerm risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to\nissue them to raise capital.

However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates.

Additionally, bond laddering helps to mitigate interest rate risk, as investors can adjust their portfolios to match changing market conditions. Furthermore, bond laddering can provide a steady stream of income, as investors can receive regular coupon payments from their bond holdings.

In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated\ncoupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.\nWe have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest\nrates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes",

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call",

However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by\ncompanies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate\nincome and eventual value for individual investors.\nWith common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will\nreceive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•",

This involves calculating a number of financial ratios that help identify trends,\nbringing elements of operational performance to light and allowing for clearer analysis and evaluation.\nA well-proven analytical approach for investors to use in evaluating common stock is to review the overall\nmarket value of the company that issues a stock. One of the most consistently used calculations in this\nanalysis, which has important applications in company and common stock evaluation, is the price-to-earnings\n(P/E) ratio.\nThe P/E ratio is computed using the following formula:\n320\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe P/E ratio is extremely useful to analysts in that it shows the expectations of the market. Essentially, the P/E\nratio is representative of the price an investor must pay for every unit of current (or future) corporate\nearnings.\nBottom-line earnings are a critical factor in valuing common stock. Investors will always want to know how\nprofitable a company is now as well as how profitable it will be in the future. When a company’s bottom line\nremains relatively flat over a period of time, leaving earnings per share (EPS) relatively unchanged, the P/E\nratio can be interpreted as the payback period for the original amount paid for each share of common stock.\nFor example, the common stock price of Cameo Corp. is currently at $24.00 a share, and its EPS for the year is\n$4.00. Cameo’s P/E ratio is calculated as\nThis ratio would typically be expressed in the form\n. Essentially, this means that investors are willing to pay\nup to six dollars for every one dollar of earnings. It can also be stated that Cameo stock is currently trading at\na multiple of six.\nThe P/E ratio is typically expressed in two primary ways. The first is as a metric listed by most finance websites\nand often carries the notation P/E (ttm). This refers to the Wall Street acronym for “trailing 12 months” and\nsignals the company’s operating performance over the past 12 months.\nAnother form of the P/E ratio is known as the forward (or leading) P/E.

The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings.

The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare).

Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their\ncommon stock:\nEV/Revenue (EV/R). Also called EV/Sales, EV/R is a valuation metric used to understand a company’s total\nvaluation compared to its annual sales levels. EV/R can help provide an analyst with an idea of exactly how\nmuch investors pay for every dollar of a company’s sales revenue.\nEV/R is considered a relatively crude metric but can be useful when analyzing companies that have different\nmethods of revenue recognition. P/E ratios, for example, can be significantly affected by changes in the\naccounting policies of companies being evaluated. This is another reason why multiple metrics should be used\nin valuations.\nAdditionally, EV/R is a useful measure for companies that are consuming cash or experiencing financial losses.\nSuch companies may be start-ups or emerging technology firms that have not fully matured and are still in a\ngrowth stage of development.\nEV/EBIT.

Using the stock’s price, a required rate of return, and the value\nof the next year’s dividend, investors can determine a stock’s value based on the total present value of future\ndividends.\nThis means that if an investor is buying a stock primarily based on its dividend, the DDM can be a useful tool to\ndetermine exactly how much of the stock’s price is supported by future dividends. However, it is important to\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n325\nunderstand that the DDM is not without flaws and that using it requires assumptions to be made that, in the\nend, may not prove to be true.\nThe Gordon Growth Model\nThe most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which uses the dividend for the next year (D1), the\nrequired return (r), and the estimated future dividend growth rate (g) to arrive at a final price or value of the\nstock.

In such a case, the\nstock’s intrinsic value is determined by dividing the annual dividend amount by the required rate of return:\nWhen examined closely, it can be seen that this is the exact same formula that is used to calculate the present\nvalue of a perpetuity, which is\nFor the purpose of using this formula in stock valuation, we can express this as\nwhere PV is equal to the price or value of the stock, D represents the dividend payment, and r represents the\nrequired rate of return.\nThis makes perfect sense because a stock that pays the exact same dividend amount forever is no different\nfrom a perpetuity—a continuous, never-ending annuity—and for this reason, the same formula can be used\nto price preferred stock. The only factor that might alter the value of a stock based on the zero-growth model\nwould be a change in the required rate of return due to fluctuations in perceived risk levels.\n326\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nExample:\nWhat is the intrinsic value of a stock that pays $2.00 in dividends every year if the required rate of return on\nsimilar investments in the market is 6%?\nSolution:\nWe can apply the zero growth DDM formula to get\nWhile this model is relatively easy to understand and to calculate, it has one significant flaw: it is highly unlikely",

Many analysts like to use the\ntwo-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable\nassumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level\nof, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will\nmaintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of\ndividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.\nAs we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:\n•\nThe first period analyzed will be one of high initial growth.\n•\nThis stage of higher growth will eventually transition into a period of more mature, stable, and sustainable\ngrowth at a lower rate than the initial high-growth period.\n•\nThe dividend payout ratio will be based on company performance and the expected growth rate of its\noperations.\nLet’s use an example. Lore Ltd. estimates that its dividend growth will be 13% per year for the next five years.\nIt will then settle to a sustainable, constant, and continuing rate of 5%.

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model.

The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\n11.4 Preferred Stock\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, there is no maturity date, and consequently, there\nis no final payment of the par value. The term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past\n(if cumulative) and present dividends before common shareholders receive any cash dividends.\n11.5 Efficient Markets\nEfficient markets are markets in which costs are minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. There\nare two forms of efficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency. Operational efficiency concerns\nthe speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available price. Informational efficiency\nconcerns how quickly a source reflects comprehensive information in the available trading prices. Financial",

Money market securities are available in smaller amounts if you choose to invest\nin money market mutual funds (MMMFs) or certain types of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nTreasury bills (T-bills) are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, with maturities of 4, 8, 13, or 26 weeks. The Treasury also auctions 52-week T-bills once every four\nweeks. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight.

The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs).

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. Financial institutions such as banks are required to keep a\nfraction of their deposits on reserve with the Fed. When banks find they are short of reserves and immediately\nneed cash to meet reserve requirements, they can borrow directly from the Fed through the so-called\n“discount window” or purchase excess reserves from other banks in the federal funds market. Often, the\nmaturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market\nnegotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate\nrange in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market.\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the activities and functioning of the federal funds market has changed. The\nfederal funds rate is still the rate targeted by the Fed for monetary policy, but the participants have evolved for\nseveral reasons. The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the\nFederal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not",

The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the\nFederal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not\nrequired to keep reserves with the Fed. In addition, the Fed now pays interest to commercial banks for\nreserves held at the Federal Reserve banks. Paying interest on reserves reduces the incentive for domestic\ncommercial banks to enter the federal funds market since they can already earn interest on their excess\nreserves.\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n355\nDaily trading volume in the federal funds market from 2016 through 2020 ranged from a high of $115 billion in\nMarch of 2018 to a low of only $34 billion on December 31, 2020.2 The volume of federal funds activity is lower\nin periods of slower economic growth because banks have fewer good opportunities to issue loans and are\nless likely to be short of required reserves.\nBond Markets\nBond markets are financial markets that make payments to investors for a specific period of time. Investors\ndecide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expect inflation to affect the value of the\nfixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\nGovernment Bond Markets\nIn the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities\nin the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.\nWe learned in Bonds and Bond Valuation that the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to\nraise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,\nas the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.\nThe debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online at https://www.usdebtclock.org/\n(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).\nTreasury notes (T-notes) are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years.

T-notes differ from T-bills in\nthat they are longer term and pay semiannual coupon interest payments, as well as the par or face value of\nthe note at maturity. T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\nexplicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and\ninstitutional investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are popular investment vehicles for many types of\ngovernment T-bill, T-note, and T-bond portfolios. An ETF is a basket of securities that can trade like stocks on a\nstock exchange. For example, IEI is an iShares ETF managed by BlackRock that invests in Treasury securities\nwith three to seven years to maturity. When investors buy this ETF, they purchase a small bundle of Treasury\nnotes that they can buy or sell, just as if they owned an individual share of stock. ETFs are a convenient way for\ninvestors to own broad portfolios of securities while still being able to trade the whole group in a single\ntransaction if they choose.\n2\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York. “Effective Federal Funds Rate.” Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\n356\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.2 Daily Trading Volume for US Treasury Notes and Bonds (data source: treasurydirect.gov)",

Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\ncost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade\nbonds. This could limit the number of investors who can participate in the market for lower-grade bonds,\nthereby reducing the liquidity, price, and tradability of those debt securities.\nThere are only two US companies with AAA credit ratings: Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson.5 Over the past 40\nyears, there has been a steady decline of AAA-rated companies (from sixty in 1980).

In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of\nthe three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.\nCommon stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a\nclaim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have\nvoting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.\nOne popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or\nmarket cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and\nessentially merge with the target. Underpricing of IPOs is well documented,12 and the owners of a private\ncompany going public do not capture the significant increase in stock price that frequently occurs in the\nmonths following an IPO.\nA SPAC offering allows the private firm owners to negotiate for a better price. A July 2020 study from\nRenaissance Capital reports that “of 223 SPAC IPOs conducted from the start of 2015 through July 2020, 89\nhave completed mergers and taken a company public.” According to the study, of those 89 mergers, “the\ncommon shares have delivered an average loss of 18.8% and a median return of minus 36.1%. That compares\nwith the average after-market return from traditional IPOs of 37.2%” over the same time period.13\nSequence of Trade Execution\nInvestors who wish to trade stocks (buy or sell) execute trades via a broker.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI.

                    "answer": "Inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply relative to the available goods and services. The factors that contribute to inflation include the following: \n\n1. Increase in money supply: When the government or central bank increases the money supply, it can lead to inflation. This is because there is more money chasing the same amount of goods and services, which drives up prices.\n\n2. Increase in demand: When demand for goods and services increases, prices tend to rise. This is because there are more people competing for the same goods and services, which drives up prices.\n\n3. Decrease in supply: When the supply of goods and services decreases, prices tend to rise. This is because there are fewer goods and services available, which drives up prices.\n\n4. Government policies: Government policies such as taxes, tariffs, and subsidies can also contribute to inflation. For example, if the government imposes a tax on a particular good, the price of that good will increase, which can lead to inflation.\n\n5. Expectations: Inflation can also be caused by people's expectations. If people expect prices to rise, they may be more willing to pay higher prices, which can lead to inflation."

After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, Yellen later\nattended Yale University and was the only woman in her 1971 PhD graduating class in economics. Men have\nlong dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.\nMotivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen\nrealized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary\npeople. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record. During her four-year tenure, the rate of unemployment\ndecreased by more than 2.5%, and employment increased in every month of her term. This is the first and\nonly time in the history of the Federal Reserve that the board chair has overseen continuous increases in\n12.2 • Historical Picture of Inflation\n365\nemployment over their entire tenure.",

In fact, T-bonds often\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,\nbond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments",

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies.

It represents the number\nof standard deviations by which a data value differs from the mean. For example, suppose that in a certain\nyear, the rates of return for various technology-focused mutual funds are examined, and the mean return is\n7.8% with a standard deviation of 2.3%. A certain mutual fund publishes its rate of return as 12.4%. Based on\nthis rate of return of 12.4%, we can calculate the relative standing of this mutual fund compared to the other\ntechnology-focused mutual funds. The corresponding z-score of a measurement considers the given\nmeasurement in relation to the mean and standard deviation for the entire population.\nThe formula for a z-score calculation is as follows:\nwhere x is the measurement,\nis the mean, and\nis the standard deviation.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nInterpreting a z-Score\nA certain technology-based mutual fund reports a rate of return of 12.4% for a certain year, while the mean\nrate of return for comparable funds is 7.8% and the standard deviation is 2.3%.

For this example, it was\ndecided to create a frequency distribution table with seven rows and a class width set to 300. The class\nwidth is the distance from the start of one interval to the start of the next interval in the subsequent row.\nFor example, the interval for the second row starts at 300, the interval for the third row starts at 600, and so\non.\nIn the second column, record the frequency, or the number of data values that fall within the interval, for\neach row. For example, for the first row, count the number of data values that fall between 0 and 299.\nBecause there is only one data value (278) that falls in this interval, the corresponding frequency is 1.

Many typical applications involve\ndetermining if there is a correlation between various stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the DJIA, and\nthe Russell 2000 index. The procedure is to first generate a scatter plot to determine if a visual trend is\nobserved, then calculate a correlation coefficient and check for significance.

To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute\nthe value of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent\nvariable (y).

Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will\nonly be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to\ntake the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make\ninvesting in US Treasury securities.\nFrom 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher\nthan the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.7 Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,\nhowever, have also been much more volatile.

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3.

Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta.

Also, you want to place the returns for SPY in the column to\nthe left of the returns for AMZN so that when you create your graph, SPY will automatically appear on the\nhorizontal axis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nState Street Global Advisors\nYou can learn more about State Street Global Advisors and its creation of the first ETF by visiting the\ncompany’s history page at its website (ssga.com) (https://openstax.org/r/ssga_institutional_our-history).\nYou will use a scatter plot to create a graph.

                    "question": "What is the standard deviation of the monthly portfolio returns?",
                    "answer": "This four-stock portfolio has a standard deviation of 7.10%. Unlike the average return, this standard deviation is not equal to the average of the standard deviations of returns of the four stocks. In fact, the standard deviation for the portfolio is less than the standard deviation for any one of the four stocks. Remember that this occurs because the stock returns are not perfectly positively correlated. The high return of one of the stocks in one month is dampened by a lower return in another stock during the same month. Likewise, a negative return in one stock during a month might be offset by a positive return in one of the other three stocks during the same month. This is the risk reduction benefit of holding a portfolio of stocks."

Investors will not be rewarded for firm-specific risk because they can diversify away from it. Investors are, however, rewarded for systematic risk. To determine how much of a firm’s risk is due to systematic risk, you can use Excel to calculate the stock’s beta."

                    "answer": "The risk and return of an investment are two important factors that investors consider when making investment decisions. Risk refers to the volatility of an investment, or the possibility of losing money. Return refers to the potential profit that an investment can generate. An investor can use the risk and return of an investment to make informed decisions about where to allocate their money. For example, an investor may choose to invest in a low-risk investment with a lower return, such as a savings account, if they are risk-averse and want to minimize the chance of losing money. On the other hand, an investor may choose to invest in a high-risk, high-return investment, such as a startup company, if they are willing to take on more risk in exchange for the potential for a higher return. In general, the risk and return of an investment are inversely related, meaning that the higher the risk, the higher the potential return, and vice versa. By considering both factors, investors can make informed decisions about where to allocate their money and achieve their investment goals."

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the\nportfolio returns can also be calculated easily.

This website on calculating the NPV on an MBA degree\n(https://openstax.org/r/calculating-the-NPV) lets you apply this concept in an educational setting. The\ninitial cost of the MBA includes both the dollars spent on tuition and the wages that a full-time student\ncould have earned if they were not in school. Why is it appropriate to include these forgone wages in the\ncalculation? What adjustments would students need to make to this analysis if they wanted to consider\nattending a part-time MBA program that allowed them to continue working while completing the program?\nNPV Profile\nThe NPV of a project depends on the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to\ntranslate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the\nembroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash\nflows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.\nTheoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In\nreality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an\napproximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall\nconclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and\nallows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.\nTo construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery\nmachine project using each of those discount rates. Table 16.6 below shows the NPV for several discount rates.\nNotice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate",

We knew the IRR was about 14% for the\nembroidery machine project because we had previously calculated the NPV for several discount rates. The IRR\nis about, but not exactly, 14%, because NPV is not exactly equal to zero (just very close to zero) when we use\n14% as the discount rate. Before the prevalence of financial calculators and spreadsheets, calculating the exact\nIRR was difficult and time-consuming. With today’s technology, this is no longer a major consideration. Later\nin this chapter, we will look at how to use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.\nNo Single Mathematical Solution. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method is that there may not be a\nsingle mathematical solution to an IRR problem. This can happen when negative cash flows occur in more than\none period in the project. Suppose your company is considering building a facility for an upcoming Olympic\ncompetition. The construction cost would be $350 million. The facility would be used for one year and generate\ncash inflows of $950 million. Then, the following year, your company would be required to convert the facility\ninto a public park area for the city, which is expected to cost $620 million.

It is the time it takes the company to recoup its\ninitial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\nNPV is negative.\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\n16.4 Alternative Methods\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered. MIRR provides a variation on IRR in which all cash\nflows are compounded using the cost of capital, resolving the reinvestment rate assumption problem of the",

This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average.

Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%.

To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\nequity in the capital structure:\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases.

Starting as a DVD rental company, Netflix\nquickly shifted its model to content streaming. In recent years, the company has become a major producer\nof content, and it is currently the largest media/entertainment company by market capitalization. It is\nexpensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content. Netflix has funded much of its content through\nselling debt.\nYou can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answers the\ncompany provides to common investor questions (https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can\nalso find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s\nbalance sheet has increased over the past few years.\nFigure 17.4 demonstrates how the value of a levered firm varies with the level of debt financing used. Vu is the\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\ninterest and taxes (EBIT).

The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to\ndetermine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target.

The calculations are based on corporate\ninformation at the end of December 2020. A risk-free rate of 3% and a market-risk premium of 5% are assumed\nin the calculations. You can see that the capital structure used by firms varies widely by industry. Companies in\nthe online retail industry are financed almost entirely through equity capital; on average, less than 7% of the\ncapital comes from debt for those companies. On the other hand, companies in the rubber and tires industry\ntend to use a heavy amount of debt in their capital structure.

This is called forecasting. Accounting and finance professionals use past performance\nalong with what they know about the business, its competitors, the economy, and the company’s plans for the\nfuture to assemble detailed financial forecasts. Forecasts are useful to many individuals for different reasons.\nA budget, a type of static forecast, helps accountants and managers see how their plans for the coming year\ncan be achieved. It outlines sales targets and how much can be spent on cost of goods sold and expenses to\nachieve the company’s bottom-line (net income) targets. Investors use financial forecasts to help guide their\ndecisions to buy, sell or hold stocks or to estimate future potential income through dividends. Perhaps most\nimportantly, for our purposes in finance, forecasts are used to help predict and manage cash flows.\nA business can have all the profit in the world at the end of the year, but if it doesn’t raise enough cash\n(liquidity) to pay the bills and pay its employees halfway through the year, it could still go bankrupt despite\nbeing profitable. Forecasting sales and expenses helps assemble a cash forecast—when sales will be collected\nand when expenses will be paid—so that financial managers can look forward far enough to have enough time\nto react accordingly and secure short- or long-term financing to meet gaps in cash flow.\nFinancial Forecasting\n18\n18 • Why It Matters\n535\n18.1\nThe Importance of Forecasting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss how to use financial statements in forecasting firm financials.\n•\nExplain why balance sheet items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\n•\nExplain why income statement items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\nIn this section, we will briefly review some of the basic elements of financial statements and how we can",

It uses financial statements to understand its\nprofitability and current financial position, to manage cash flow, and to communicate its finances to outside\nparties such as investors, governing bodies, and lenders. We will use Clear Lake’s company information and\nhistorical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that\nin this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast\nfinancial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to\nforecast their financial performance differently. We are demonstrating just one approach here.\nThe balance sheet shows all the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity at one point in time. It also supports the\naccounting equation in a very clear and transparent way. We find one section of the balance sheet contains all\ncurrent and noncurrent assets that must total the other section of the balance sheet: total liabilities and\nequity.

A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance. This means that total assets\n(what the company owns) must equal total liabilities and equity (what the company owes).\n538\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

                    "answer": "The statement of cash flows is a financial statement that summarizes the cash inflows and outflows for a business over a period of time. It is one of the four main financial statements that a company must prepare to give a complete picture of its financial health. The statement of cash flows is used to show how a company's cash position has changed over time and to provide information about the sources and uses of cash. It is also used to assess a company's ability to meet its financial obligations and to make payments on its debt. The statement of cash flows is prepared using the cash-basis accounting method, which means that it only includes transactions that result in a change in cash. This means that non-cash transactions, such as the sale of inventory or the purchase of equipment, are not included in the statement of cash flows. The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The operating activities section shows the cash flow from the company's core business activities, such as sales and cost of goods sold. The investing activities section shows the cash flow from the company's investments in assets, such as the purchase of equipment or the sale of investments. The financing activities section shows the cash flow from the company's financing activities, such as the issuance of debt or the payment of dividends. The statement of cash flows is an important financial statement because it provides information about a company's cash position and its ability to meet its financial obligations. It is used by investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to assess the financial health of a company."

This represents a 4.5%\ngrowth from the prior year. Forecasted sales, based solely on this information, might be appropriate at\n4.5% growth for the next year, keeping in mind that many other factors should also be considered along\nwith this information. Historical sales are only one set of data to use as a starting point.\nLooking at Figure 18.9, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods decides to take its first pass at a forecast using\nthe more conservative estimate of 18% total sales growth. The company could consider last year’s sales of\n$126,000 and increase them by 18% to arrive at total forecasted sales for next year of\n. Next, to get the monthly sales, the company could use the same percent of the\ntotal for each month that it did for the previous year. For example, sales in January of last year were 7.1% of\nthe full year’s sales. To find the forecast for the next year, the company would take the forecasted sales of\n$148,680 for the year and multiply that by 7.1% to get $10,620 for January. The process is repeated for each\n542\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmonth to get the full year.\nFigure 18.9 Forecasted Sales Data\nKeep in mind that this is only a starting point.

It’s critical that all members of the team take the time and effort to research their\ncustomers and the factors that impact their business in order to effectively assess the impact of these factors\non future sales. Though only two adjustments were made here, it’s likely that a large firm would have to\nconsider many, many factors that would ultimately impact monthly sales figures before arriving at a\nconclusion.\n18.3\nPro Forma Financials\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine pro forma in the context of a financial forecast.\n•\nDescribe the factors that impact the length of a financial forecast.\n•\nExplain the risks associated with a financial forecast.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will move beyond the sales forecast and look at the general nature, length,\nand timeline of forecasts and the risks associated with using them. We’ll look at why we use them, how long\nthey generally are, what the key variables in a forecast are, and how we pair those variables with common-size\nanalysis to develop the forecast.\nPurpose of a Forecast\nAs mentioned earlier in the chapter, forecasts serve different purposes depending on who is using them. Our\nfocus here, however, is the world of finance. In this realm, the key purpose of pro forma (future-looking)\nfinancial statements is to manage a firm’s cash flow and assess the overall value that the firm is generating\nthrough future sales growth. Growing just for the sake of growing doesn’t always yield favorable income for\nthe firm. A larger top-line sales figure that results in lower net income doesn’t make sense in the grand\nscheme of things. The same is true of profitable sales that don’t generate enough cash flows at the right time.\nThe firm may make a profit, but if it doesn’t manage the timing of its cash flows, it could be forced to shut\ndown if it can’t cover the costs of payroll or keep the lights on. Forecasting helps assess both cash flow and the\nprofitability of future growth. Managers can forecast cash flow using data from forecasted financial",

Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As we saw earlier in the chapter, we begin with forecasted sales because they are\nthe basis for many of the forecasted costs.\nLet’s begin with the sales forecast for Clear Lake Sporting Goods that we saw earlier in the chapter, in Figure\n18.9, and use it along with the prior year income statement by month shown in Figure 18.12. We will consider\nother data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.12 Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month\nThe first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income.

Figure 18.13 shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods using all of this data.\nFigure 18.13 Forecasted Income Statement\nForecast the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales.

Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable.

Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings.

For example, if the company has a goal of maintaining a certain level of inventory or a\nminimum balance in its cash account, that information can be used to guide the estimate for those accounts.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n549\n18.5\nForecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a cash flow forecast.\n•\nAssess a cash flow forecast to determine future cash funding needs.\n•\nUse pro forma financial statements and cash flow forecasts to assess the value of growth to the firm.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will use the forecasted income statement, forecasted balance sheet, and\nother information we know about the firm’s policies and goals for the coming year to generate and assess a\ncash flow forecast.\nCreate a Cash Flow Forecast\nA cash flow forecast isn’t overly complex, yet it is not easy to assemble because it requires making many\nassumptions about the future. A cash forecast begins with the beginning cash balance, adds anticipated cash\ninflows, and deducts anticipated cash outflows. This identifies cash surpluses and shortages.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, we see in Figure 18.15 that the company begins with cash of\n$42,581,000 in January of the new year. Next, it lists the cash inflows, or cash received from customers. Given\nthe assumption that customers pay in 90-day terms, the cash flow is filled in by plugging in the sales forecast\nfor the three prior months. For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the\nnet sales forecast for March (see Figure 18.13).",

For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the\nnet sales forecast for March (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.15 Forecasted Cash Inflows\nNext, Clear Lake identifies cash outflows, which include accounts payable, salaries, rent, utilities, dividends,\nand interest payments. Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods\nsold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, in Figure 18.16, we\nsee that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted\nincome statement.\nSalaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent. Utilities,\nlike accounts payable, are assumed to be paid within 30 days. Thus, the cash outflow for utilities is the utilities\nexpense for the prior month from the forecasted income statement.\nManagement intends to pay a quarterly dividend of $10,000. Thus, in Figure 18.16, we see $10,000 cash\noutflows forecasted for March, June, September, and December. Interest on the long-term liability is paid\nquarterly. Thus, the $500 cash outflows in March, June, September, and December are simply the monthly\ninterest expense of $167 from the income statement, summed for each quarter.\n550\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.16 Forecasted Cash Inflows and Outflows\nUsing a Cash Forecast to Determine Additional Funds Needed\nFinally, at the end of the cash flow forecast, cash outflows are subtracted from the cash inflows. This identifies\nwhether a cash surplus (extra) or cash deficit (not enough) exists for each month. For example, in Figure\n18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,\nwhich results in a cash deficit of $13,000.\nClear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess\ntheir monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,\nthe deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that\nthe company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March. It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth",

While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process.

In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement.

Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential\nchanges they are considering. They may reduce the new salaries package by a percentage point to see if it\ngets them closer to their goal. They may adjust cost of goods sold by a certain percentage if they feel they can\nnegotiate with vendors to work down their costs.

These statements could all have been generated by hand, of course, but that\nwouldn’t be an effective use of time. As mentioned in prior sections, several different types of software can be\nquite effective in making the forecasting process faster and more flexible. In this section, we will review just\none common option, Microsoft Excel.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file) containing key Chapter 18\nExcel exhibits.\nUsing the “Sheet”\nCreating a budget in Excel can be very simple or extremely complex, depending on the size and complexity of\nthe business and the number of formulas and dependencies that are written into the Excel workbook.\nCreating the forecast in Excel follows the same steps and flow we just explored in this chapter but with the\npower of a software program to do the math for you. We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key\nformulas in Excel.\n1.\nFirst, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is\ncalculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. In Figure 18.19, you\ncan see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase\nthe prior year’s sales by 18%.\n2.\nNext, the sales are distributed by month. In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula",

Notice that the formula\nthen multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last\nquarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new\nyear by roughly 2%.\nFigure 18.19 Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel\n3.\nAs Clear Lake continues to fill out its forecasted income statement, the next formula we see is a simple\nsum formula to calculate net sales in B8 (see Figure 18.20). It’s a simple formula that subtracts sales\nreturns and allowances in B7 from gross sales in B4. Similar formulas are also found in B10 for gross\nmargin and B18 for net income.\n4.\nIn cell B9, we see a multiplication formula that multiplies sales from B4 by 0.5, or 50%. This is because\n554\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmanagement feels that cost of goods sold will remain the same as last year, in most quarters at least, and\nlast year’s percentage was 50%.\n5.\nRent, depreciation, and salaries are all simply typed in, as they are fixed expenses that remain the same as\nlast year.\n6.\nThe utilities calculation, found in cell B14, is somewhat similar to the sales calculation.

To begin the year, in Figure 18.22, we see that the formula\nin B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three\nmonths prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected\nfrom customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.\nUtilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be\nthe utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement. Note that interest payments are\nassumed to be zero in January and February, but in March, the formula in D14 sums the interest expenses on\nthe forecasted income statement for January, February, and March. This is because interest is paid quarterly.\nFinally, note the formula in C4.

Financial managers monitor and analyze each component\nof the cash conversion cycle. Ideally, a company’s management should minimize the number of days it takes\nto convert inventory to cash while maximizing the amount of time it takes to pay suppliers.\nQuickly converting inventory to sales speeds up cash inflows and shortens the cash cycle, but it also could help\nreduce inventory losses as a result of obsolescence. Inventory becomes obsolete because of a variety of\nfactors including time—inventory that has not been sold for a long period of time and is not expected to be\nsold in the future has to be written down or written off according to accounting rules. Write-offs of inventory\ncan result in significant losses for a company. In the food business, inventory conversion periods take on great\nimportance because of spoilage of perishable goods; in retailing, seasonal items lose value the longer they\nstay on the shelves.\nVarious inventory management techniques are used to shorten production time in manufacturing, and in\nretailing, strategies are used to reduce the amount of time a product sits on the shelf or is stored in the\nwarehouse. Production techniques such as just-in-time inventory systems and marketing and pricing\nstrategies can have an impact on the number of days in the inventory conversion cycle.\nFor the receivables collection period, a relatively long receivables collection period means that the company is\nhaving trouble collecting cash from its customers and so whatever can be done to speed up collections while\nstill offering competitive credit terms should be pursued by financial managers. For example, companies that\nconverted paper invoicing to e-invoicing most likely reduce the average collection period by some number of\ndays, as it makes sense that if a bill is transmitted electronically, lag time is cut (no delays because of “snail\nmail”) and collections (payments back to the company from customers) may happen sooner.

Purchasing managers search for and evaluate vendors, negotiate order quantities, and prepare\npurchase orders. In carrying out the purchasing process, credit terms are granted by the company’s vendors\nand purchases of inventory and services can be made on trade credit accounts—allowing the purchaser time\nto pay. The purchaser carries an accounts payable balance until the account is paid.\nTrade credit is referred to as spontaneous financing, as it occurs spontaneously with the gearing up of\noperations and the additional investment in current assets. Think of it this way: If sales are increasing, so too is\nproduction. Increased sales mean more current assets (accounts receivable and inventory), and increased\nsales mean increases in accounts payable (financing happening spontaneously with increased sales and\ninventory purchases). Compared to other financing arrangements, such as lines of credit and bank loans,\ntrade credit is convenient, simple, and easy to use.\nOnce a company is approved for trade credit, there is no paperwork or contracts to sign, as is the case with\nvarious forms of bank financing. Invoices specify the credit terms, and there is usually no interest expense\nassociated with trade credit.

With a credit card, a consumer opens an account with a credit limit. Most trade credit is\noffered to a company with an open account that has a credit limit up to which the company can purchase\ngoods or services without having to pay the cash up front. As long as the payments are made in accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement (also called credit terms), no interest or additional fees are charged on the\ncredit balance except possibly for a fee for late payment.\nInitially, the vendor’s credit department approves both a trade credit limit and credit payment terms (i.e.,\nnumber of days after the invoice date that payment is due). Timely payments on accounts payable (trade\ncredit) helps create a credit history for the purchasing firm.\nTrade Credit Terms\nTrade credit arrangements often carry credit terms that offer an incentive, called a discount, for a company\n(the buyer) to pay its bill within a relatively short period of time. Net terms, also referred to as the full credit\nperiod, are the number of days that a business (purchaser) has before they must pay their invoice. A common\nnet term is Net 30, with payment due in full within 30 days of the invoice.\nMany vendors also offer cash discounts to customers that pay their bill early. A company’s invoice that\nspecifies payment terms of “2/10 n/30” (stated as: “two ten net 30”) would allow a 2 percent discount if the\nbuyer’s account balance is paid within 10 days of the invoice date; otherwise, the net amount owed would be\ndue in 30 days. The “10 days” in the example is the discount period—the number of days the buyer has to\ntake advantage of the cash discount for an early payment, also known as quick payment.\nFor example, Jackson’s Premium Jams Inc. received a $10,500 invoice for the purchase of jelly jars. The invoice\nhas payment terms of 2/10 n/30. Jackson’s pays the bill within 10 days of the invoice date. Jackson’s payment\nwould be\n.

In Cost of Trade Credit, there is an example that shows the high annualize opportunity cost (36.73\npercent) of not taking advantage of cash discounts.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nTrade Credit of International Trade\nWhen international trade occurs, two important documents are commonly required: a letter of credit and\na bill of lading. A letter of credit is issued by a financial institution on behalf of the foreign buyer\n(importer). The bill of lading is a legal document that gives proof of a contract between a transportation\ncompany and the buyer and is one important piece of documentation that allows the buyer to draw on the\nletter of credit. A bill of lading serves as a document of title and proof of receipt of goods by the shipper.\nThe letter of credit secures a promise of payment to the seller (exporter) provided that the terms of the sale\nare met. For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a\nliability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.\nCost of Trade Credit\nTrade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,\nbank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade\ncredit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts\npayable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long\n576\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nas payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.\nHowever, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of\ncash discounts when offered by sellers.

Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments. Cash alternative investments are not committed to the\nstock market.\nSecurity\nDescription\nUS Treasury bills",

The\nCorporate Finance Institute’s website states that “the ‘5 Cs of Credit’ is a common phrase used to describe\nthe five major factors [character, capacity, collateral, capital, and conditions] used to determine a potential\nborrower’s creditworthiness.” It goes on to say that “a credit report provides a comprehensive account of\nthe borrower’s total debt, current balances, credit limits, and history of defaults and bankruptcies, if any.”5\nMore on the 5 Cs of credit can be found on the Corporate Finance Institute’s website (https://openstax.org/\nr/corporate-finance).\nDetermining the Credit Policy\nA company’s credit policy encompasses rules of credit granting and procedures for the collections of accounts.\nIt’s how a company will process credit applications, utilize credit scoring and credit bureaus, analyze financial\nstatements, make credit limit decisions, and conduct collection efforts when accounts become delinquent (still\noutstanding after their due date).\nEstablishing Credit Terms\nTrade credit terms were discussed earlier. Recall that part of the terms and conditions of a sale are the credit\nterms—elements of a sales agreement (contract) that indicate when payment is due, possible discounts (for\nquick payments), and any late fee charges.\nIf open credit is for a sales transaction, an agreement is made as to the length of time for which credit is to be\ngranted (payment period) and a discount for early payment.

One of those tools is the accounts\nreceivable aging schedule (report). To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account\nbalances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.\nAn account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice).

Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000.

Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender).

The cash budget, like any other budget, looks to the future. It projects the cash flows\ninto and out of the company. The budgeting process of a company is a really an integrated process—it links a\nseries of budgets together so that company objectives can be achieved. For example, in a manufacturing\ncompany, a series of budgets such as those for sales, production, purchases, materials, overhead, selling and\nadministrative costs, and planned capital expenditures would need to be prepared before cash needs (cash\nbudget) can be predicted.",

The sales budget impacts what needs to be produced (production\nbudget), and the production budget influences planned purchases of material (purchases budget), overhead\nresources (overhead budget), and the amount of labor costs for the year ahead (direct labor budget.)\nFor a merchant (such as a wholesaler or retailer), the annual budget would be less complex than that of a\nmanufacturing firm but would still require an inventory purchases budget and an operating expense budget\n(such as selling and administrative expenses). For a service firm, a purchase budget for inventory would not be\nnecessary, but an operating budget would be. All businesses need a cash budget, which is the topic of the next\nsection of this chapter.\nThe example operating budget presented here is of a merchandising company. Budgets are prepared\nfollowing a process that begins with a sales (or revenue) forecast. The sales forecast is normally based on\ninformation obtained from both internal and external sources and predicts the amount of units to be sold in\nthe planning period—usually one year into the future.\nA company’s management, in consultation with its marketing and sales executives, would prepare a sales\nbudget by making assumptions about the number of units that are expected to be sold and the prices that will\nbe charged. From the sales budget, projections are made as to cash receipts each month, and therefore\nassumptions have to be made as to how much of each month’s sales will be cash sales and how much cash will\nflow into the company from the collection credit sales (including cash flow in from the prior month’s sales).\nFigure 19.7 provides an example of a sales budget and projected accounts receivable collections and cash\nsales for the months of January through December. Keep in mind that projected monthly sales amounts are\nnot equal to cash collected from sales. Because of sales on credit, some cash from sales lags credit sales as\ncollections can extend beyond the month of sale. Credit terms such terms such as net 30 (net amount owed to\nbe paid in 30 days) have to be considered when developing a forecasted cash collection pattern.\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n585\nFigure 19.7 Example of a Sales and Collections Budget\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file1) containing key Chapter 19\nExcel exhibits.",

If sales are expected to increase, purchases of\ninventory and some operating expenses would also increase. To meet the demand for goods and services (as\ndefined in the sales budget), a purchases (inventory) budget would be prepared. In this example (Figure 19.8),\nthe purchases budget shows projected purchases of inventory (merchandise) and the projected payments\n(also called disbursements) for each month.\nCash outflows as a result of purchases often do not equal the projected purchase amount. That is because\npayments for purchases are usually on credit (accounts payable), and so purchases for one month typically get\nspread out over a period of time that encompasses the current month and the month (or months) thereafter.\nTo keep this example simple, the assumption is that the purchases are paid for in the following month (an\naverage days payable outstanding of 30 days). However, in other cases, payment patterns may be based on\nother payment periods such as 45, 60, or even 90 days, depending on the trade credit terms.\nFigure 19.8 Purchases Budget\nAn operating expense budget is prepared next and is basically a prediction of the selling and administrative\nexpenditures of the company. Notice in Figure 19.9 that in the operating expense budget, cost of goods sold\n(an expense) is not included, nor are noncash expenses such as depreciation. The cash outlays related to\ngoods sold, at least in a merchandising operation, are accounted for in the purchases budget (payments for\npurchases of inventory.)\nWith the sales, purchases, and operating expense budgets prepared, the cash budget can be prepared. Some\nof the “inputs” to the cash budget are from the sales (collections of cash), purchases (payments), and the\noperating expense budget (cash expenditures for selling and administrative expenses).

The purpose of the cash budget is to estimate\ncash flows, to help ensure sufficient cash balances are maintained during the planning period, and to plan for\nexternal financing during periods of cash deficits.\nWhen a budget is prepared in Excel, cash budget analysts can play “what if” with different scenarios to see\nwhen cash surpluses and deficits are expected. Cash surpluses means that funds can be invested in\nmarketable securities to earn a rate of return, while cash deficits mean that financing, such as a line of credit,\nwill be necessary (assuming forecasts are accurate).\nAlthough the example shown in Figure 19.10 is a monthly cash budget, a cash budget could be prepared using\nany useful time elements: weekly, monthly, or quarterly.\nOne common practice is to use a rolling cash budget. A rolling cash budget is continually updated to add a\nnew budget period, such as a month’s amount of cash flow activity, as the most recent budgeted month\nexpires. For example, assume that a 12-month cash budget is prepared for a period covering January 20X1 to\nDecember 20X1. Once the month of January 20X1 has concluded, a 12-month planning period continues by\nadd January 20X2 to the last column of the budget. The rolling cash monthly budget is an extension of the\ninitial cash budget model, adding one month and thereby always extending cash flow projections one year\ninto the future.\nFigure 19.9 Operating Expenses Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n587\nFigure 19.10 Sample Cash Budget\nUsing Figure 19.9 as an example, Table 19.5 shows the formulas that form the skeleton of a monthly cash\nbudget.\nBeginning\nCash Balance\nThis is the amount of cash the company expects to have on the first day of the month.

The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables.

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital.

Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the\nexpenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.\nThe Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in\nFigure 20.3. In 2012, $1.00 could be purchased with fewer than 80 Japanese yen. In 2015, it took over 120 yen to\npurchase $1.00.\nFigure 20.3 Japanese Yen to One US Dollar8\nIf a company is receiving yen from customers and paying expenses in dollars, the company is harmed when\nthe yen depreciates relative to the dollar, meaning that the yen the company receives from its customers can\nbe exchanged for fewer dollars. Conversely, when the yen appreciates, it takes fewer yen to purchase each\ndollar; this appreciation of the yen benefits companies with revenues in yen and expenses in dollars.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nProjecting Sales in US Dollars\nThe managers of a firm think that the exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollars will be\nnext year.

The hotel agrees to provide\nyou the room on March 1 and cannot change the price of the room when you arrive. With a forward contract,\nyou are also agreeing that you will indeed make the purchase and you cannot change your mind; so, using the\nhotel room analogy, this would mean that the hotel will definitely charge your credit card for the agreed-upon\n$200 per night on March 1.\nThe forward contract is an individualized contract between the buyer and the seller; they are both under a",

This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate\nthe company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six\nmonths.\nThe price that is in the contract is called the strike price (exercise price). Suppose the company purchases a\ncall contract for US dollars with a strike price of KWN 1,200/USD. While this contract would be for a set size, or\na certain number of US dollars, we will talk about this transaction as if it were per one US dollar to highlight\nhow options contracts work.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n609\nThe company must pay a price, known as the premium, to purchase this call option contract. For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is\n, then the company will choose to exercise\nthe option. The company will be saving KWN 25 for each dollar purchased, but the company originally paid 50\nKWN for the contract. So, the company will be 25 KWN worse off than if it had never purchased the call option.",

By purchasing this put option, the\ncompany is spending INR 5 to guarantee that it can sell its US dollars for rupees in three months at a price of\nINR 75/USD.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n611\nIf, in three months, when the company receives payment in US dollars, the spot exchange rate is higher than\n, the company will simply exchange the US dollars for rupees at that exchange rate, allowing",

With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate.

Southwest Airlines has been known as the most\naggressive airline when it comes to hedging the risk of jet fuel cost volatility. In this interview, the CEO of\nSouthwest Airlines, Gary Kelly, discusses crude oil prices in the spring of 2012 and the impact on Southwest\nAirlines.\n1. How volatile are oil prices, and how large of an impact does that volatility have on the cost structure of an\nairline?\n2. Gary Kelly states that he sees fuel prices as the largest single business risk Southwest Airlines faces and\nthat hedging that risk has become more expensive. Why do you think it became more expensive for\nSouthwest Airlines to hedge this risk in 2012?\nBMW in the United States\nClick to view content (https://openstax.org/r/BMW_US_Natural_Hedging)\nWhile the name BMW may sound German, a significant amount of BMW’s production occurs outside of\nGermany. Watch this video to learn about this international activity of BMW.\n3. In the video, the potential car buyer is concerned about the impact of the value of the euro on the price of\nthe BMW. Why, if he is paying for the car in US dollars, do you think that he is impacted by the currency\nexchange rate?\n4. How do you think opening plants in the United States, and in other parts of the world, provides a currency\nhedge for BMW?\n622\n20 • Video Activity\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIndex\nSymbols\n“C&G” Credit Ratings\n358\n(ESG)\n53\n(GAAP)\n156\n2014 Winter Olympics\n491\n3M\n288\n3M (MMM)\n450\n401k plans\n9\nA\nAAPL (Apple)\n468\naccounting equation\n105, 134\nAccounting Standards Update\nNo. 2014-09\n110\naccounts receivable aging\nschedule\n581\naccounts receivable turnover\nratio\n168\naccrual basis\n144\naccrual-basis accounting\n102\nacid-test ratio\n172\nafter-tax cost of debt\n510\nagency problem\n50\nAgency theory\n52\nagent\n50\nAIG\n47\nAlibaba\n177\nallowance for doubtful\naccounts\n581\nAlphabet (Google)\n359\nAmazon\n21, 43, 180, 327, 332,\n341, 359\nAmazon (AMZN)\n178\nAmerican Airlines\n67, 507, 514,\n515, 599\nAmerican Express\n579\nAmerican Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA)\n110\nAmerican options\n609\nAmerican Superconductor\nCorporation\n169\namortization\n323\nAMZN (Amazon)\n467\nannual meeting\n55\nannual report\n54\nannuity\n231\nannuity due\n234\nApple\n179, 359, 508\nApple, Inc.\n112, 131, 132, 134,\n135, 136, 137, 139, 141, 142, 147,\n153, 154, 156, 157, 284, 450\nappreciated\n605",

                    "question": "P/E TTM",
                    "answer": "P/E TTM is a ratio that compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share (EPS). It is used to determine a company's valuation and to compare it to other companies in the same industry. The ratio is calculated by dividing the company's stock price by its earnings per share for the trailing 12 months. A high P/E TTM ratio indicates that the company's stock is expensive relative to its earnings, while a low ratio indicates that the stock is undervalued. The P/E TTM ratio is a useful tool for investors to assess the value of a company's stock and to make informed investment decisions."

                    "answer": "A payday advance loan is a short-term, unsecured loan that is typically used to cover unexpected expenses or to bridge the gap between paychecks. It is a type of loan that is often used by people who do not have access to traditional forms of credit, such as a credit card or a bank loan. The loan is usually repaid on the borrower's next payday, along with any fees or interest that may be charged by the lender. Payday advance loans are generally considered to be a high-cost form of credit and should be used only as a last resort."

                    "answer": "The current yield of the 3-month Treasury bill is 0.06%. This is based on the most recent auction of the 3-month Treasury bill, which was held on February 27, 2023. The current yield is calculated by dividing the current market price of the Treasury bill by the face value of the bill and then multiplying by 100. The current market price of the 3-month Treasury bill is $99.95, and the face value is $100. Therefore, the current yield is 0.06%. This is a relatively low yield compared to other types of investments, such as stocks or bonds, but it is still a relatively safe investment due to the government backing of the Treasury bill."

The yield to maturity is calculated by dividing the current market price of the Treasury bond by the face value of the bond and then subtracting the coupon rate from the result. The current market price of the 30-year Treasury bond is $97.25, and the face value is $100. The coupon rate is 2.75%, so the yield to maturity is 2.6%. This is a relatively low yield compared to other types of investments, such as stocks or bonds, but it is still a relatively safe investment due to the government backing of the Treasury bond."
