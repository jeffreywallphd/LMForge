But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics.

In \nEngland, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision. They often \nresorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way. This is essentially reasoning by analogy. Thus the use of precedent in common-law cases \ncame into being, and a doctrine of stare decisis (pronounced STAR-ay-de-SIGH-sus) became accepted \nin English courts. Stare decisis means, in Latin, “let the decision stand.” \n \nMost judicial decisions that don’t apply legislative acts (known as statutes) will involve one of three areas \nof law—property, contract, or tort. Property law deals with the rights and duties of those who can legally \nown land (real property), how that ownership can be legally confirmed and protected, how property can \nbe bought and sold, what the rights of tenants (renters) are, and what the various kinds of “estates” in \nland are (e.g., fee simple, life estate, future interest, easements, or rights of way). Contract law deals with \nwhat kinds of promises courts should enforce. For example, should courts enforce a contract where one of \nthe parties was intoxicated, underage, or insane?

The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v.

We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies.

To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to \nunderstand the relationships between the various kinds of law. \n \n \nConstitutions \nConstitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1]",

Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body.

As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness.

Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers \nhired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are \nnot always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law \nrequire officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the \ncompany. This is the “agency problem” often discussed in corporate governance: how to get officers and \nother top management to align their own interests with those of the shareholders. For example, a CEO \nmight trade insider information to the detriment of the company’s shareholders. Even board members are \nsusceptible to misalignment of interets; for example, board members might resist hostile takeover bids \nbecause they would likely lose their perks (short for perquisites) as directors, even though the tender offer \nwould benefit stockholders. Among other attempted realignments, the use of stock options was an \nattempt to make managers more attentive to the value of company stock, but the law of unintended \nconsequences was in full force; managers tweaked and managed earnings in the bubble of the 1990s bull \nmarket, and “managing by numbers” became an epidemic in corporations organized under US corporate \nlaw.

Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist.

The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment.

Moreover, \nGriswold illustrates another important and much-debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive \ndue process (see Section 4.5.3 \"Fifth Amendment\"). The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is \nbrought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business \nafter Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited \nrather than overruled Roe v.

The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In \ndeciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the \nSupreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the \nConstitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its \ninterpretation.

Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional.

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president.

Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision.

For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job.

The specialist \ngave him erroneous information over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form that said \nCharles could safely take on the extra work. Unfortunately, as it turned out, Charles did exceed the salary \nlimit, and so the government cut off his pension during the time he earned too much. Charles sues to \nrecover his lost pension.

(Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.)

An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him.

Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the \nguilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But imputation of guilt is not \nlimited to a conspiracy. The agent may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate officer \ndirects a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home. The employee \nreasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains \nmoney that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit.

If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his \nstate of mind was.

The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that \nmay cause harm to others.

A \ncriminal case begins with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing from the scene; if \nthe defendant is not caught, a warrant for the defendant’s arrest will issue. The warrant is issued by a \njudge or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge of a specific crime against the \naccused. It is not enough for a police officer to go before a judge and say, “I’d like you to arrest \nBonnie because I think she’s just murdered Clyde.” She must supply enough information to satisfy \nthe magistrate that there is probable cause (reasonable grounds) to believe that the accused \ncommitted the crime. The warrant will be issued to any officer or agency that has power to arrest the \naccused with warrant in hand. \n \nThe accused will be brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing. The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail.

For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial.

The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort.

Hurting \nsomeone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet \nthe law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a \nremedy for \"defaming\" someone, orally or in writing, to others. \n \nAlthough the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines. More and \nmore people injured by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of remedy through the \ncourts). Headlines boast of multimillion-dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations, \nagainst newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against oil companies that devastate entire \necosystems. All are examples of tort suits. \n \nThe law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by \nlegislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the \ncommon law (judicial decisions). Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules \nthat govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other. Through \ncontracts, individuals can craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other. In the absence of \ncontracts, tort law holds individuals legally accountable for the consequences of their actions. Those who \nsuffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated. \n \nMany acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious. But torts and crimes are different, and the \ndifference is worth noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society punishes the murderer; \nit does not usually compensate the family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a \nprivate wrong for which damages are owed.

Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant.

Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions. One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than",

Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

This rule has \nbeen abolished by workers’ compensation statutes in most states. \n \nAct of God \nTechnically, the rule that no one is responsible for an “act of God,” or force majeure as it is sometimes \ncalled, is not an excuse but a defense premised on a lack of causation. If a force of nature caused the harm, \nthen the defendant was not negligent in the first place. A marina, obligated to look after boats moored at \nits dock, is not liable if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was possible destroys \nsomeone’s vessel. However, if it is foreseeable that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by \na natural event, then there is liability. For example, a work crew failed to remove residue explosive gas \nfrom an oil barge. Lightning hit the barge, exploded the gas, and injured several workmen. The plaintiff \nrecovered damages against the company because the negligence consisted in the failure to guard against \nany one of a number of chance occurrences that could ignite the gas. [3] \n \nVicarious Liability \nLiability for negligent acts does not always end with the one who was negligent. Under certain \ncircumstances, the liability is imputed to others. For example, an employer is responsible for the \nnegligence of his employees if they were acting in the scope of employment. This rule of vicarious liability \nis often called respondeat superior, meaning that the higher authority must respond to claims brought \nagainst one of its agents. Respondeat superior is not limited to the employment relationship but extends \nto a number of other agency relationships as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n305 \nLegislatures in many states have enacted laws that make people vicariously liable for acts of certain people \nwith whom they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency. It is common, for example, for \nthe owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car. So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others. In these situations, although the injurious \nact of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) \nis not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now \nturn. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY",

This fault is not synonymous with moral blame. \n \nAside from acts intended to harm, the fault lies in a failure to live up to a standard of reasonableness or \ndue care. But this is not the only basis for tort liability. Innocent mistakes can be a sufficient basis. As we \nhave already seen, someone who unknowingly trespasses on another’s property is liable for the damage \nthat he does, even if he has a reasonable belief that the land is his. And it has long been held that someone \nwho engages in ultrahazardous (or sometimes, abnormally dangerous) activities is liable for damage that \nhe causes, even though he has taken every possible precaution to avoid harm to someone else. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n307 \n \nLikewise, the owner of animals that escape from their pastures or homes and damage neighboring \nproperty may be liable, even if the reason for their escape was beyond the power of the owner to stop (e.g., \na fire started by lightning that burns open a barn door). In such cases, the courts invoke the principle of \nstrict liability, or, as it is sometimes called, liability without fault. The reason for the rule is explained \nin Klein v. Pyrodyne Corporation (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"). \n \nStrict Liability for Products \nProducts liability is extremely important. Strict liability may also apply as a legal standard for products, \neven those that are not ultrahazardous. In some national legal systems, strict liability is not available as a \ncause of action to plaintiffs seeking to recover a judgment of products liability against a manufacturer, \nwholesaler, distributor, or retailer. (Some states limit liability to the manufacturer.) But it is available in \nthe United States and initially was created by a California Supreme Court decision in the 1962 case \nof Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. \n \nIn Greenman, the plaintiff had used a home power saw and bench, the Shopsmith, designed and \nmanufactured by the defendant.

We have already seen assumption of risk and comparative negligence in terms of negligence \nactions; the application of these is similar in products-liability actions. \n \nUnder product misuse, a plaintiff who uses a product in an unexpected and unusual way will not recover \nfor injuries caused by such misuse.

Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are \ncharges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees. California has been the leader among \nthe state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints \nthat the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless \ncompanies. Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of \ncontract. \n \nSpecific Performance \nSpecific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which \nhe obligated himself in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be \nissued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is seeking \nenforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from \ndoing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate \nremedy.) Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental \nvalue because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while still \nexecutory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily. Specific \nperformance is an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach of contract to sell a unique \nitem (real estate is always unique). \n \nRestitution \nAs the word implies, restitution is a restoring to one party of what he gave to the other. Therefore, only \nto the extent that the injured party conferred a benefit on the other party may the injured party be \nawarded restitution. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n354 \nIf the claimant has given the other party a sum of money, there can be no dispute over the amount of the \nrestitution interest.

Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom’s restitution \ninterest is $100. But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance. The courts \nhave considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the \ninjured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the \nproperty of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance. Mellors, a gardener, agrees to \nconstruct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500. After erecting \nthree, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased \nthe value of the Lady’s grounds by $800. If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s \nrestitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would \nhave cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends on who \nrepudiated the contract and for what reason. \n \nTort vs. Contract Remedies \nFrequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious conduct. A physician warrants her treatment as \nperfectly safe but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient for life. The patient could sue \nfor malpractice (tort) or for breach of warranty (contract). The choice involves at least four \nconsiderations: \n1. Statute of limitations. Most statutes of limitations prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort \nactions. \n2. Allowable damages. Punitive damages are more often permitted in tort actions, and certain kinds of \ninjuries are compensable in tort but not in contract suits—for example, pain and suffering. \n3. Expert testimony. In most cases, the use of experts would be the same in either tort or contract suits, \nbut in certain contract cases, the expert witness could be dispensed with, as, for example, in a contract \ncase charging that the physician abandoned the patient. \n4. Insurance coverage. Most policies do not cover intentional torts, so a contract theory that avoids the \nelement of willfulness would provide the plaintiff with a surer chance of recovering money damages. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n355",

There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights. It is “well established” that an optionor may not rely on an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n403 \noptionee’s failure to exercise an option when he has committed any act or failed to perform any duty \n“calculated to cause the optionee to delay in exercising the right.” [Citation] “[T]he optionor may not \nmake statements or representations calculated to cause delay, [or] fail to furnish [necessary] \ninformation.…” Similarly, “[I]t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause \nof the failure of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own \nliability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.” [Citation]… \n \nApplying these principles, we agree with the magistrate judge, who concluded that Microsoft, which \ncreated a benefit to which the plaintiffs were entitled, could not defend itself by arguing that the plaintiffs \nwere unaware of the benefit, when its own false representations precluded them from gaining that \nknowledge.

If the principal directed the agent to commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the \nagent’s carrying out his instructions would bring harm to someone, the principal is liable. This is an \napplication of the general common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by delegating an \nunlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls \nthe trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in his use of agents will be held liable for their \nnegligence. This rule comes into play when the principal fails to supervise employees adequately, gives \nfaulty directions, or hires incompetent or unsuitable people for a particular job.

Whether Brown had apparent authority to make the July 16, 1976, modification is \na question of how, in the circumstances, a third person, e.g., a customer of the Bank such as Kanavos, \nwould reasonably interpret Brown’s authority in light of the manifestations of his principal, the Bank. \n \nTitles of office generally do not establish apparent authority. Brown’s status as executive vice-president \nwas not, therefore, a badge of apparent authority to modify agreements to which the Bank was a party. \n \nTrappings of office, e.g., office and furnishing, private secretary, while they may have some tendency to \nsuggest executive responsibility, do not without other evidence provide a basis for finding apparent \nauthority. Apparent authority is drawn from a variety of circumstances. Thus in Federal Nat. Bank v. \nO’Connell…(1940), it was held apparent authority could be found because an officer who was a director, \nvice-president and treasurer took an active part in directing the affairs of the bank in question and was \nseen by third parties talking with customers and negotiating with them. In Costonis v. Medford Housing \nAuthy.…(1961), the executive director of a public housing authority was held to have apparent authority to \nvary specifications on the basis of the cumulative effect of what he had done and what the authority \nappeared to permit him to do. \n \nIn the instant case there was evidence of the following variety of circumstances: Brown’s title of executive \nvice-president; the location of his office opposite the president; his frequent communications with the \npresident; the long course of dealing and negotiations; the encouragement of Kanavos by the president to \ndeal with Brown; the earlier amendment of the agreement by Brown on behalf of the Bank on material \npoints, namely the price to be paid by the Bank for the shares and the repurchase price; the size of the",

Three types of authority \nmay bind the principal: (1) express authority—that which is actually given and spelled out, (2) implied \nauthority—that which may fairly be inferred from the parties’ relationship and which is incidental to the \nagent’s express authority, and (3) apparent authority—that which reasonably appears to a third party \nunder the circumstances to have been given by the principal. Even in the absence of authority, a principal \nmay ratify the agent’s acts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n452 \nThe principal may be liable for tortious acts of the agent but except under certain regulatory statutes may \nnot be held criminally liable for criminal acts of agents not prompted by the principal. Under the doctrine \nof respondeat superior, a principal is generally liable for acts by a servant within the scope of employment. \nA principal usually will not be held liable for acts of nonservant agents that cause physical damage, \nalthough he will be held liable for nonphysical torts, such as misrepresentation. The principal will not be \nheld liable for tortious acts of independent contractors, although the principal may be liable for injuries \nresulting from his failure to act in situations in which he was not legally permitted to delegate a duty to \nact. Whenever an agent is acting to further the principal’s business interests, the principal will be held \nvicariously liable for the agent’s intentional torts. What constitutes scope of employment is not easy to \ndetermine; the modern trend is to hold a principal liable for the conduct of an agent if it was foreseeable \nthat the agent might act as he did. \n \nMost states have special rules of vicarious liability for special situations; for example, liability of an \nautomobile owner for use by another. Spouses are not vicariously liable for each other, nor are parents for \nchildren, except for failing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nIn general, an agent is not personally liable on contracts he has signed on behalf of a principal. This \ngeneral rule has several exceptions recognized in most states: (1) when the agent is serving an undisclosed \nor partially disclosed principal, (2) when the agent lacks authority or exceeds his authority, and (3) if the \nagent entered into the contract in a personal capacity.",

Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order.

The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460 \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit”) and retained the \ncommon-law theory that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals—the aggregate theory. \n \nRUPA moved more toward making partnerships entities. According to the NCCUL, “The Revised Act \nenhances the entity treatment of partnerships to achieve simplicity for state law purposes, particularly in \nmatters concerning title to partnership property. RUPA does not, however, relentlessly apply the entity \napproach. The aggregate approach is retained for some purposes, such as partners’ joint and several \nliability.” [4] Section 201(a) provides, “A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.” [5] \nEntity Characteristics of a Partnership \nUnder RUPA, then, a partnership has entity characteristics, but the partners remain guarantors of \npartnership obligations, as always—that is the partners’ joint and several liability noted in the previous \nparagraph (and discussed further in Chapter 12 \"Partnership Operation and Termination\"). This is a very \nimportant point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them \nis, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes \npersonal and unlimited liability. This personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished, \nsubject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and limited liability companies, as discussed \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". And, of course, the owners of corporations are also not generally \nliable for the corporation’s obligations, which is a major reason for the corporate form’s popularity. \n \nFor Accounting Purposes \nUnder both versions of the law, the partnership may keep business records as if it were a separate entity, \nand its accountants may treat it as such for purposes of preparing income statements and balance sheets. \n \nFor Purposes of Taxation \nUnder both versions of the law, partnerships are not taxable entities, so they do not pay income taxes. \nInstead, each partner’s distributive share, which includes income or other gain, loss, deductions, and",

Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important.

Loomis and Shanahan bring this appeal \nafter an agreement entered into with respondent Jerry Carr Whitehead failed. \n \nIn the fall of 2003, Shanahan entered into a verbal agreement with Whitehead, a rancher, through \nWhitehead’s ranch foreman to have their cattle wintered at Whitehead’s ranch. Neither Loomis nor \nWhitehead was present when the ranch foreman made the deal with Shanahan, but the parties agree that \nthere was no mention of the 52 Cattle Company at the time they entered into the agreement or anytime \nduring the course of business thereafter. Shanahan and Loomis subsequently alleged that their cattle were \nmalnourished and that a number of their cattle died from starvation that winter at Whitehead’s ranch. \nWhitehead denied these allegations. \n \nSuit against Whitehead \nThe following summer, Shanahan and Loomis sued Whitehead, claiming negligence and breach of \ncontract. Later, well into discovery, Whitehead was made aware of the existence of the 52 Cattle Company \nwhen Shanahan stated in his deposition that he did not actually own any of the cattle on Whitehead’s \nranch. In his deposition, he described the partnership arrangement. At about the same time, Whitehead \nlearned that the name “52 Cattle Company” was not registered with the Elko County Clerk. \n \nWhitehead then filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that, pursuant to NRS 602.070, \nLoomis and Shanahan’s failure to register their fictitiously named partnership with the county clerk \nbarred them from bringing a legal action. The district court agreed with Whitehead, granted the motion, \nand dismissed Loomis and Shanahan’s claims.

He initially \nthought that Shanahan owned the cattle and Loomis had “some type of interest.” Shanahan did not enter \ninto the contract under the fictitious “52 Cattle Company” name. Moreover, Whitehead does not allege \nthat he was misled by either Loomis or Shanahan in any way that would cause him to think he was doing \nbusiness with the 52 Cattle Company. In fact, Whitehead did not know of the 52 Cattle Company until \nShanahan mentioned it in his deposition. Under these circumstances, when there simply was no \nindication that Loomis and Shanahan represented that they were conducting business as the 52 Cattle \nCompany and no reliance by Whitehead that he was doing business with the 52 Cattle Company, NRS \n602.070 does not bar the suit against Whitehead. \n \nWe therefore reverse the district court’s partial summary judgment in this instance and remand for trial",

Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”?

Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404.

[16] For postdissociation liability, exposure is for two years if at the time of entering into the \ntransaction the other party (1) reasonably believed the dissociated one was a partner, (2) didn’t have \nnotice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have constructive notice from a filed “statement of \ndissociation.” For example, Baker withdraws from the firm of Able, Baker, and Carr. Able contracts with \nHydroLift for a new hydraulic car lift that costs $25,000 installed. HydroLift is not aware at the time of \ncontracting that Baker is disassociated and believes she is still a partner. A year later, the firm not having \nbeen paid, HydroLift sues Able, Baker, and Carr and the partnership. Baker has potential liability. Baker \ncould have protected herself by filing a “statement of dissociation,” or—better—the partnership agreement \nshould provide that the firm would file such statements upon the dissociation of any partner (and if it \ndoes not, it would be liable to her for the consequences). \n \nDissolution \nDissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution (see the discussion later in this section of how the firm \ncontinues after a dissociation); dissolution and winding up happen only for the causes stated in RUPA \nSection 801, discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nThere are three causes of dissolution: (1) by act of the partners—some dissociations do trigger dissolution; \n(2) by operation of law; or (3) by court order. The partnership agreement may change or eliminate the \ndissolution trigger as to (1); dissolution by the latter two means cannot be tinkered with.[17] \n \n(1) Dissolution by act of the partners may occur as follows: \n \n• \nAny member of an at-will partnership can dissociate at any time, triggering dissolution and \nliquidation.

The first corporations were not \nbusiness enterprises; instead, they were associations for religious and governmental ends in which \nperpetual existence was a practical requirement. Thus until relatively late in legal history, kings, popes, \nand jurists assumed that corporations could be created only by political or ecclesiastical authority and that \ncorporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more",

The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends",

The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the \ndefinition in the 1933 and 1934 acts. Thus a security may be governed by the securities acts but not by the \nUCC. The definition of a private placement of securities also differs between the UCC and the securities \nacts. Other differences exist.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\").

By this device, voting shares are given to voting trustees, who are empowered to vote the \nshares in accordance with the objectives set out in the trust agreement. Section 7.30 of the RMBCA limits \nthe duration of voting trusts to ten years.

These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting \nrecords) must also have a “proper purpose,” such as to determine the propriety of the company’s dividend \npolicy or to ascertain the company’s true financial worth.

Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients.

There are two \nmain types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. In a cash merger, the shareholders of the \ndisappearing corporation surrender their shares for cash. These shareholders retain no interest in the \nsurviving corporation, having been bought out. This is often called a freeze-out merger, since the \nshareholders of the disappearing corporation are frozen out of an interest in the surviving corporation. \n \nIn a noncash merger, the shareholders of the disappearing corporation retain an interest in the surviving \ncorporation. The shareholders of the disappearing corporation trade their shares for shares in the \nsurviving corporation; thus they retain an interest in the surviving corporation when they become \nshareholders of that surviving corporation. \n \nUnless the articles of incorporation state otherwise, majority approval of the merger by both boards of \ndirectors and both sets of shareholders is necessary (see Figure 18.2 \"Merger\").

As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay).

(Of course Attorney should not indorse in blank; she should indorse “Tina Attorney, \nin trust for Carlene Creditor” and deposit the check in her trust account.) \n \nThe dichotomy here between restrictive and unrestrictive indorsements is the indorser’s way of showing \nto what use the instrument may be put. \n \nConditional Indorsement \nAn indorser might want to condition the negotiation of an instrument upon some event, such as “Pay \nCarla Green if she finishes painting my house by July 15.” Such a conditional indorsement is generally \nineffective: the UCC, Section 3-206(b), says a person paying for value can disregard the condition without \nliability. \n \nQualified Indorsement \nAn indorser can limit his liability by making a qualified indorsement. The usual qualified indorsement \nconsists of the words “without recourse,” which mean that the indorser has no contract liability to \nsubsequent holders if a maker or drawee defaults. A qualified indorsement does not impair negotiability. \nThe qualification must be in writing by signature on the instrument itself. By disclaiming contract \nliability, the qualified indorser also limits his warranty liabilities, though he does not eliminate them. \nSection 3-415(a) of the UCC narrows the indorser’s warranty that no defense of any party is good against \nthe indorser. In its place, the qualified indorser warrants merely that he has no knowledge of any defense. \n \n“Without recourse” indorsements can have a practical impact on the balance sheet. A company holding a \npromissory note can obtain cash by discounting it—indorsing it over to a bank for maturity value less the \nbank’s discount. As an indorser, however, the company remains liable to pay the amount to subsequent \nholders should the maker default at maturity. The balance sheet must reflect this possibility as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n823 \ncontingent liability. However, if the note is indorsed without recourse, the company need not account for \nany possible default of the maker as a contingent liability. \n \nThe dichotomy here between qualified and unqualified indorsements is the indorser’s way of indicating \nwhat liability she is willing to incur to subsequent holders. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY",

This matter presents a question of first \nimpression in the Pennsylvania state courts, namely how should the loss be allocated in double forgery \nsituations.

The Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC” or “Code”) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n838 \naddresses the allocation of liability in cases where either the maker’s signature is forged or where the \nindorsement of the payee or holder is forged.

However, the drafters of the UCC failed to specifically \naddress the allocation of liability in double forgery situations.…Consequently, the courts have been left to \ndetermine how liability should be allocated in a double forgery case.… \n \nII. The Effect of the UCC Revisions \nIn 1990, new revisions to Articles 3 and 4 of the UCC were implemented (the “revisions”).…The new \nrevisions made a major change in the area of double forgeries. Before the revisions, the case law was \nuniform in treating a double forgery case as a forged drawer’s signature case [only], with the loss falling \n[only] on the drawee bank. The revisions, however, changed this rule by shifting to a comparative fault \napproach. Under the revised version of the UCC, the loss in double forgery cases is allocated between the \ndepositary and drawee banks based on the extent that each contributed to the loss.… \n \nSpecifically, revised § 3-405 of the UCC, entitled “Employer’s Responsibility for Fraudulent Indorsement \nby Employee,” introduced the concept of comparative fault as between the employer of the dishonest \nemployee/embezzler and the bank(s).

It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the \ncheck jointly to Gill and Wisner as co-payees. Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that",

Why didn’t the Hauser Co. specifically deny the authenticity of the signatures? \n4.

Discussion \nA. Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability. \nTransfer warranties trigger when a person transfers an instrument for consideration. UCC § 3-416(a)). A \ntransfer, for purposes of the statute, occurs when an instrument is delivered by a person other than its \nissuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. § 3-\n203(a). Martin transferred an instrument to PNC when he endorsed the check and deposited it in his \naccount, thereby granting PNC the right to enforce the check. [Citation] Consideration, for purposes of the \nstatute, need only be enough to support a simple contract. [Citation] Martin received consideration from \nPNC because PNC made the funds provisionally available before confirming whether First Century Bank \nwould honor the check. \n \nAs a warrantor, Martin made a number of representations to PNC, including representations that he was \nentitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. [UCC] § \n3-416(a). Martin breached his warranties twofold. First, he was not entitled to enforce the check because \nthe check was a counterfeit and, as a result, Martin had nothing to enforce. Second, the drawer’s signature \nwas not authentic because the check was a counterfeit. \n \nMartin does not dispute these facts. Instead, Martin argues, summary judgment is inappropriate because \nFriedman and Jennewein admitted that PNC made a mistake when Friedman said that he thought the \ncheck cleared and Jennewein said that she never would have authorized the wire transfer. Friedman’s and \nJennewein’s statements are immaterial facts. The transfer warranties placed the risk of loss on Martin, \nregardless of whether PNC, Martin, or both of them were at fault. [Citation] Martin, in any event, fails to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n928 \nsupport Friedman’s and Jennewein’s statements with firsthand deposition testimony or affidavits, so the \nstatements do not qualify as competent evidence.

First, all but one of the cases were decided before the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Martin fails to argue, much less demonstrate, \nthat his cases are good law. Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss. Martin’s cases address who \nbears the risk of loss as between other players: a drawee bank and a collecting agent [Citation]; a drawer \nand a drawee bank [Citation]; and an execution creditor and drawee bank [Citation—all of these cases are \nfrom 1910–1930]. The one modern case that Martin cites is also inapposite because the case involves a \ndrawer and a drawee bank. [Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card. Under the agreement’s terms, Martin agreed to bind himself to the \nagreement by signing the signature card. Martin does not dispute that the account agreement was a \nbinding contract, and he does not dispute the account agreement’s terms. \n \nMartin’s account agreement authorized PNC to charge Martin’s account for the value of any item returned \nto PNC unpaid or any item on which PNC did not receive payment. If PNC’s charge-back created an \noverdraft, Martin was required to pay PNC the amount of the overdraft immediately. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n929 \nThe scam of which Martin was a victim falls squarely within the charge-back provision of the account \nagreement. The check was returned to PNC unpaid. PNC charged Martin’s account, leaving it with an \noverdraft. Martin was obliged to pay PNC immediately. \n \nAs with the breach-of-transfer-warranties claim, Martin cannot defend against the breach-of-contract",

The account agreement authorized PNC to charge back \nMartin’s account “even if the amount of the item has already been made available to you.” The account \nagreement, as a result, placed the risk of loss on Martin. Any mistake on PNC’s part was immaterial \nbecause PNC always had the right to charge back Martin’s account. [Citation] \n \nC. Martin’s Counterclaims \nMartin has asserted counterclaims for violations of various Uniform Commercial Code provisions; \nnegligence and failure to exercise ordinary care; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; detrimental reliance; conversion; and \nnegligent retention and supervision. Martin argues that “[t]o the extent that either party should be \nentitled to summary judgment in this case, it would be Martin with respect to his counterclaims against \nPNC.” Martin, however, has not moved for summary judgment on his counterclaims, and the court does \nnot address them on PNC’s motion. \n \nD. Damages \nPNC’s recovery under both theories of liability is contingent on PNC’s demonstrating that it acted in good \nfaith. PNC may recover for breach of the transfer warranties only if it took the check in good faith. § 3-\n416(b). Moreover, PNC must satisfy the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which Kentucky \nlaw incorporates in the account agreement.

Also, \ncertainly, tight limits on interest rates cause creditors to deny credit to the less creditworthy, which may \nnot be helpful to the lower classes. That’s the rationale for the usury exceptions related to pawnshop and \npayday loans. \n \n \nDisclosure of Credit Costs \nSetting limits on what credit costs—as usury laws do—is one thing. Disclosing the cost of credit is another. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act \nUntil 1969, lenders were generally free to disclose the cost of money loaned or credit extended in any way \nthey saw fit—and they did. Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why?

Before the law went into effect, the companies—as one commentator put it—\nunleashed a “frenzy of retaliation,” [2]by repricing customer accounts, changing fixed rates to variable \nrates, lowering credit limits, and increasing fees. \n \nState Credit Disclosure Laws \nThe federal TILA is not the only statute dealing with credit disclosures. A uniform state act, the Uniform \nConsumer Credit Code, as amended in 1974, is now on the books in twelve US jurisdictions, [3] though its \neffect on the development of modern consumer credit law has been significant beyond the number of \nstates adopting it. It is designed to protect consumers who buy goods and services on credit by \nsimplifying, clarifying, and updating legislation governing consumer credit and usury. \n \nGetting Credit \nDisclosure of credit costs is a good thing. After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check. And somebody who knows another person’s \ncreditworthiness has what is usually considered confidential information, the possession of which is \nsubject to abuse, and thus regulation. \n \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThrough the 1960s, banks and other lending and credit-granting institutions regularly discriminated \nagainst women. Banks told single women to find a cosigner for loans. Divorced women discovered that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n993 \nthey could not open store charge accounts because they lacked a prior credit history, even though they had \ncontributed to the family income on which previous accounts had been based. Married couples found that \nthe wife’s earnings were not counted when they sought credit; indeed, families planning to buy homes \nwere occasionally even told that the bank would grant a mortgage if the wife would submit to a \nhysterectomy! In all these cases, the premise of the refusal to treat women equally was the unstated—and \nusually false—belief that women would quit work to have children or simply to stay home. \n \nBy the 1970s, as women became a major factor in the labor force, Congress reacted to the manifest \nunfairness of the discrimination by enacting (as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974.

It may be that this case involves an instance of disparate treatment based on sex in the denial of \ncredit.

[4] The notice requirement is aimed at \nprotecting a secured party in the typical situation in which incoming inventory is subject to a prior \nagreement to make advances against it. If the original creditor gets notice that new inventory is subject to \na PMSI, he will be forewarned against making an advance on it; if he does not receive notice, he will have \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1043 \npriority. It is usually to the earlier creditor’s advantage that her debtor is able to get credit to “floor” \n(provide) inventory, without selling which, of course, the debtor cannot pay back the earlier creditor. \n \n(3) Purchase-money security interest in fixtures. Under UCC Section 9-334(e), a perfected security in \nfixtures has priority over a mortgage if the security interest is a PMSI and the security interest is perfected \nby a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days after. A mortgagee is usually a \nbank (the mortgagor is the owner of the real estate, subject to the mortgagee’s interest). The bank’s \nmortgage covers the real estate and fixtures, even fixtures added after the date of the mortgage (after-\nacquired property clause). In accord with the general rule, then, the mortgagee/bank would normally have \npriority if the mortgage is recorded first, as would a fixture filing if made before the mortgage was \nrecorded. But with the exception noted, the bank’s interest is subordinate to the fixture-seller’s later-\nperfected PMSI. Example: Susan buys a new furnace from Heating Co. to put in her house. Susan gave a \nbank a thirty-year mortgage on the house ten years before. Heating Co. takes back a PMSI and files the \nappropriate financing statement before or within twenty days of installation. If Susan defaults on her loan \nto the bank, Heating Co. would take priority over the bank. And why not? The mortgagee has, in the long \nrun, benefited from the improvement and modernization of the real estate. (Again, there are further \nnuances in Section 9-334 beyond our scope here.) A non-PMSI in fixtures or PMSIs perfected more than \ntwenty days after goods become a fixture loses out to prior recorded interests in the realty. \n \nOther Exceptions \nWe have noted the three immediate exceptions to the general rule that “the firstest with the mostest” \nprevails.

Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live. Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\nRisk and Return in Finance\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk.

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm",

Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial\npaper until maturity.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\nmaturity of the NCD.

Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of\nconsumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like\nthis: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment\nadviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my\ninvestments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13\nmillion!”\nAn important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and\nlong-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be\navailable? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?\nWhen saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of\ncompounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low\ntolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start\na holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you\nhave funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.\nAn intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation\nhome. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment\nreturns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term\ninvestments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.\nLong-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and\nthe luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater\nrisk and higher expected average annual rates of return.

In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity.

At the turn of the millennium, the\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced.

For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds.

Or would it be better for them to think not in terms of\ntime, but rather in the usage of the machine?\nDouble-Declining-Balance Depreciation\nThe double-declining-balance depreciation method is the most complex of the three methods because it\naccounts for both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few years of the asset’s life. Double\ndeclining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under\nstraight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a\nfive-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year.\nNext, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-\n118\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndeclining method takes usage into account by doubling the straight-line percentage.

While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\nProfit versus Cash Flow\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the",

The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake\nSporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid\nout in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\nearnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced\nretained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning\nbalance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of\ntheir earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.\nFigure 5.10 Statement of Retained Earnings",

The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable? Again, the answer is no.\nRemember, the accounting equation rests on the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. This",

Common stockholders normally have voting rights.\nPreferred stock has unique rights that are “preferred,” or more advantageous, to shareholders than common\nstock. Unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights and do not\nshare in the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the “preferred” classification entitles shareholders\nto a dividend that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared). Treasury stock is shares that were\noutstanding and have been repurchased by the firm but not retired. Thus they are still issued, but not\noutstanding. Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and par value of the common\nstock. For example, if a firm issued and sold stock at a market price of $20 that had a $5 par value, $5 for each\nshare would be recorded into common stock and the excess $15 per share would be recorded into the\nadditional paid-in capital account.\nIf we review the balance sheet for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see just two elements of equity: common\nstock and retained earnings.

It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared.

It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business.

The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these\nare liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an\nincrease to the statement.",

Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared.

That is exactly how the answer turns\nout, as the calculated required interest rate of approximately 6.19% is just slightly greater than the growth\nrate of 6% used in the previous example. So, based on this, it looks like our answer here passes a simple\n“sanity check” review.\n7.4\nApplications of TVM in Finance\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how the time value of money can impact your personal financial goals.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to inflation.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to financial risk.\n•\nExplain how compounding period frequency affects the time value of money.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet’s say you want to buy a new car next year, and the one you have your eye on should be selling for $20,000\na year from now. How much will you need to put away today at 5% interest to have $20,000 a year from now?\nEssentially, you are trying to determine how much $20,000 one year from now is worth today at 5% interest\nover the year. To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower or discount the future value\nback to the current period.\nThe interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the\ndiscount rate because it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to\nthe annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this\ndiscount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing\nthe FV equation, we can turn\ninto\nwhich is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest\nfactor (PVIF). The PVIF is simply the reciprocal of the FVIF, which makes sense because these factors are doing\nexactly opposite things. Therefore, the amount you need to deposit today to earn $20,000 in one year\nat 5% interest is\nThe Multiple-Period Scenario\nThere will often be situations when you need to determine the present value of a cash flow that is scheduled to\noccur several years in the future (see Figure 7.17).

When\ninterest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury and money market investments due\nto their extremely poor returns.\nIt soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and\ndirect impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples",

The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\nrate.

An old adage in finance claims, “If you aren’t in control of\nyour money, your money is controlling you.” Fortunately, learning to manage your money is not difficult if\nyou’re disciplined and understand some simple techniques. For example, several years ago, the author was\nnegotiating for a three-year auto loan from a well-known regional dealer, who was offering an interest rate of\n2%. When the manager left the room for a few minutes, we pulled out a financial calculator and proved in less\nthan a minute that the actual interest rate in the payments he was proposing was nearly double the quoted\nand advertised rate.\nIn addition to understanding how the loan process works, which improves your negotiation skills when\nborrowing, businesses and individuals can better control their investments by understanding basic rules of\nfinance, particularly as seen in this and the preceding chapter. Assume you pledge to invest $1,000 per year at\n5% return per year and are curious about how much you will have accumulated by age 60. If you begin at age\n30, you will have $69,760; if you begin at age 20, you will have $126,840. Can the extra 10 years make that much\nof a difference?

Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\nBy substitution,\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend\nof $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what\nprice should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is\n, or $30.17.\nSome investments might involve a growing perpetuity. In this case, some degree of change in the amount of\nthe dividend is expected. The formula is altered slightly to include a rate of growth in the denominator, noted\nas G, making the growing perpetuity formula\n8.1 • Perpetuities\n229\nTo illustrate a growing perpetuity, let’s revisit Rooney Corp.’s stock, with its annual dividend of $1.75 and a\nrequired rate of return in the market of 5.8%.

But a\nprofessional decision maker must “hit it out of the park” when making major capital investment choices and\nrecommendations.\nAs a student in a course of business studies and career development, it is highly likely that you will be a\ndecision maker about projects that are likely to generate future cash flows but will also require a large initial\nexpense. When you ask your manager to invest $500,000 or more in a new piece of equipment that could help\nyour department meet or exceed its goals, you must be prepared to defend your request. Competing\nmanagers and departments will be asking for similar funding, and there simply might not be enough for\neveryone. This decision process requires financial analysis.\nMark Cuban of Shark Tank fame enjoys citing the series’ catchphrase: “Know thy numbers.” As a business\nprofessional, you must be able to assess potential profit against expenditures to be successful. In most cases,\nthis is based on our understanding of cash flow. A major capital investment might seem initially like a gamble,\nbut it is a gamble that can be hedged in your favor with understanding, analysis, and knowledge of your\nnumbers.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to give you information and instruction on how this is done. The techniques we\nwill discuss in this chapter will clarify decisions that must be made in the process of investing in a business.

While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,",

The issuer\nstates the rate as an annual rate, even though payments may be made more frequently. Thus, for semiannual\nbonds, the most common type of corporate and government bond, the coupon payment is the par value of the\nbond multiplied by the annual coupon rate and then divided by the number of payments per year, 2.\nWe have already seen the coupon rate.

Using a par value of $1,000, we determined that the annual coupon\npayments would be\n.\nFor the Coca-Cola bond, we note from Table 10.5 that it has a coupon rate of 1% and is paid semiannually.\nUsing a par value of $1,000, we can determine that the coupon payments would be\n.\nThe Relationship of Yield to Maturity and Coupon Rate to Bond Prices\nThe value or price of any bond has a direct relationship with the YTM and the coupon rate.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate of a bond exceeds the YTM, the bond sells at a premium compared to its par value.\nThat is, market demand will push the price of the bond to an amount greater that than its face or par\nvalue. We call this kind of bond a premium bond.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate is less than the YTM, the bond sells at a discounted amount, or less than its par\nvalue. We refer to such a bond as a discount bond.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate and YTM are identical, a bond will sell at its par value. Bonds that experience this\nscenario in the market are referred to as par value bonds.\nThe interest or coupon payments of a bond are determined by its coupon rate and are calculated by",

The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-",

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to\nissue them to raise capital. In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political\nmovement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets.

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call",

This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•",

For example, a firm might shift into a dividend stream\npattern that will allow you to use one of the dividend models to take a shortcut for pricing the stock.

However, problems can arise\nwhen using these models because the timing and amounts of future cash flows may be difficult to predict.\n340\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n11.3\nDiscounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how the DCF model differs from DDMs.\n•\nApply the DCF model.\n•\nExplain the advantages and disadvantages of the DCF model.\nWhen investors buy stock, they do so in order to receive cash inflows at different points in time in the future.\nThese inflows come in the form of cash dividends (provided the stock does indeed pay dividends, because not\nall do) and also in the form of the final cash inflow that will occur when the investor decides to sell the stock.\nThe investor hopes that the final sale price of the stock will be higher than the purchase price, resulting in a\ncapital gain. The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young",

However, it should be noted\nthat cash flow is not always the best means of measuring financial health. A company can always sell a large\nportion of its assets to generate a positive cash flow, even if it is operating at a loss or experiencing other\nfinancial difficulties. Additionally, investors prefer to see companies reinvesting their cash back into their\nbusinesses rather than sitting on excessive balances of idle cash.\nSimilar to other models, the discounted cash flow model is only as good as the information entered. As the\ncommon expression goes, “garbage in, garbage out.” This can often be the case if reasonably accurate cash\nflow estimates are not available or if an unrealistic discount rate or required rate of return is used in the\ncalculations. It is always best to use several different methods when valuing companies and their common\nstock.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nPlease view this short video on discounted cash flow (https://openstax.org/r/short_video_on_discounted)\nand how this method can be applied in stock valuation.\n11.4\nPreferred Stock\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine preferred stock.\n•\nCalculate the intrinsic value of preferred stock.\n•\nUnderstand the difference between common stock and preferred stock.\nFeatures of Preferred Stock\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\nPreferred stock will often feature a dividend that a company is obligated to pay out before it makes any\ndividend payments to common stockholders. In cases of bankruptcy and liquidation of the issuing company,\npreferred stockholders have priority claim to assets before common stockholders. Additionally, preferred\nstockholders are usually entitled to a set (or constant) dividend every period.\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, they have no maturity date, and consequently,\nthere is no final payment of the par value.

The only time a company would pay this par value to the\nshareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\n11.4 • Preferred Stock\n343\nFor example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future. It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant\ncash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of\nperpetuity.\nIt is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another\nform of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred\nstock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.\nDetermining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock\nWe can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the\nfollowing example.

Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases.

The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation. A lower standard deviation of returns suggests less uncertainty of\nreturns and therefore less risk.\nCapital market history demonstrates that the average return to stocks has significantly outperformed other\nfinancial security classes, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or the money market.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies.

Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\nSolution:\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\n$5,000,000.\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\nset.\n13.1 • Measures of Center\n383\nMode\nAnother measure of center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one\nmode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data\nset with two modes is called bimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology\nstock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:\nTo find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this\ndata set is 72. It is helpful to know that the most common closing price of this particular stock over the past 20\nweeks has been $72.00.\nGeometric Mean\nThe arithmetic mean, median, and mode are all measures of the center of a data set, or the average. They are\nall, in their own way, trying to measure the common point within the data—that which is “normal.” In the case\nof the arithmetic mean, this is accomplished by finding the value from which all points are equal linear\ndistances. We can imagine that all the data values are combined through addition and then distributed back to\neach data point in equal amounts.\nThe geometric mean redistributes not the sum of the values but their product. It is calculated by multiplying\nall the individual values and then redistributing them in equal portions such that the total product remains the\nsame. This can be seen from the formula for the geometric mean, x̃ (pronounced x-tilde):\nThe geometric mean is relevant in economics and finance for dealing with growth—of markets, in investments,\nand so on.

It is small when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little\nvariation or spread. It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\nvariation.\nSuppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The average stock\nprice for both stocks is $5. For Stock A, the standard deviation of the stock price is 2, whereas the standard\ndeviation for Stock B is 4. Because Stock B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more\nvariation in the stock price for Stock B than in the price for Stock A.\nThere are two different formulas for calculating standard deviation. Which formula to use depends on whether\nthe data represents a sample or a population. The notation s is used to represent the sample standard\ndeviation, and the notation\nis used to represent the population standard deviation. In the formulas shown\nbelow, x̄ is the sample mean,\nis the population mean, n is the sample size, and N is the population size.\nFormula for the sample standard deviation:\nFormula for the population standard deviation:\nVariance\nVariance also provides a measure of the spread of data values.

The value of the stock of a company changes as the expectations of the\nfuture revenues and expenses of the company change. These expectations may change due to a number of\nevents and new information.

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

Geopolitical events, major storms, and pandemics can also impact the\nentire market. Investors in stocks cannot avoid this type of risk. This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that\ninvestors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.\nIn addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,4 the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as\nthe number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration in this\nsubsequent article by Statman (https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman) for context). Increasing the size\nof the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio\nincreases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How\nmany stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all\nfinancial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification\nthan a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients. A portfolio that consists of American Airlines,\nSpirit Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Jet Blue, along with a few other stocks, is\nnot very diversified because of the heavy concentration in the airline industry. The term diversified portfolio is\na relative concept, but the average investor can create a reasonably diversified portfolio with approximately a\ndozen stocks.\n15.3\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine risk premium.\n•\nExplain the concept of beta.\n•\nCompute the required return of a security using the CAPM.\nRisk-Free Rate\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a financial theory based on the idea that investors who are willing\nto hold stocks that have higher systematic risk should be rewarded more for taking on this market risk.

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3.

Second, the NPV method provides a clear decision criterion. Projects with a positive NPV\nshould be accepted, and projects with a negative NPV should be rejected.

However, if it costs Sam’s more than 14% to attract capital, the\nembroidery machine should not be purchased.\nIn other words, a company wants to accept projects that have an IRR that exceed the company’s cost of\nattracting funds. The cash flow from these projects will be great enough to cover the cost of attracting money\nfrom investors in addition to the other costs of the project. A company should reject any project that has an\nIRR less than the company’s cost of attracting funds; the cash flows from such a project are not enough to\ncompensate the investors for the use of their funds.\nCalculating IRR without a financial calculator is an arduous, time-consuming process that requires trial and\nerror to find the discount rate that makes NPV exactly equal zero. Your calculator uses the same type of trial-\nand-error iterative process, but because it uses an automated process, it can do so much more quickly than\nyou can.

Investors like to\nspeak in terms of annual percentage returns when evaluating investment possibilities.\nDisadvantages\nOne disadvantage of using IRR is that it can be tedious to calculate. We knew the IRR was about 14% for the\nembroidery machine project because we had previously calculated the NPV for several discount rates. The IRR\nis about, but not exactly, 14%, because NPV is not exactly equal to zero (just very close to zero) when we use\n14% as the discount rate. Before the prevalence of financial calculators and spreadsheets, calculating the exact\nIRR was difficult and time-consuming. With today’s technology, this is no longer a major consideration. Later\nin this chapter, we will look at how to use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.\nNo Single Mathematical Solution. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method is that there may not be a\nsingle mathematical solution to an IRR problem. This can happen when negative cash flows occur in more than\none period in the project. Suppose your company is considering building a facility for an upcoming Olympic\ncompetition. The construction cost would be $350 million. The facility would be used for one year and generate\ncash inflows of $950 million. Then, the following year, your company would be required to convert the facility\ninto a public park area for the city, which is expected to cost $620 million. Placing these cash flows in a timeline\nresults in the following (Table 16.8):\n16.3 • Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\n487\nYear\n0\n1\n2\nCash Flow ($Millions) (350) 950 (620)\nTable 16.8\nThe NPV profile for this project looks like Figure 16.3.

Because\nthe NPV profile line crosses the horizontal axis twice, there are two IRRs. In other words, there are two interest\nrates at which NPV equals zero.\nFigure 16.3 NPV Profile Graph for a Project with Two IRRs\nReinvestment Rate Assumption.

Therefore, the decision criterion using the PI method is to accept a\nproject if the PI is greater than 1 and reject a project if the PI is less than 1.\nNote that the NPV method and the PI method of project evaluation will always provide the same answer to the\naccept-or-reject question. The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from\nbest to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.\nDiscounted Payback Period\nThe payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the\nfact that it ignores the time value of money. The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\ndetermine the payback period.\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback\nperiod does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00)\n2,000.00\n4,000.00\n5,000.00\n5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\nDiscounted Cash Flow ($)\n(16,000)\n1,834.86\n3,366.72\n3,860.92\n3,542.13 3,249.66 2,981.34\nCumulative Discounted\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00) (14,165.14) (10,798.42) (6,937.50) (3,395.37) (145.72) 2,835.62\nTable 16.9\nWhen the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.\nThe discounted payback period would be\nyears. This adjusted calculation addresses the\npayback period method’s flaw of not considering the time value of money, but managers are still confronted\nwith the other disadvantages. No objective criterion for acceptance or rejection exists because of the lack of a\ntheoretical underpinning for what is an acceptable payback period length. The discounted payback period\nignores any cash flows after breakeven occurs; this is a serious drawback, especially when comparing mutually\nexclusive projects.\nModified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)\nFinancial analysts have developed an alternative evaluation technique that is similar to the IRR but modified in",

This truck is smaller and will not be able to hold as many\nfrozen treats. However, the truck is newer, with lower mileage, and you estimate that you can use it for six\nyears. This newer truck will allow you to generate a cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The\nNPV of the newer truck is $80,658.\nBecause both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which\ntruck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its\nhigher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made\nsimply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV\nthan the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.\nThere are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life\nproject concludes, another, similar project will be available.\nReplacement Chain Approach\nWith the replacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal\nthe life of the long-life project. You can purchase the newer, lower-mileage ice-cream truck and run your\nbusiness for six years. To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last\nfor three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for\nthe next three years. In essence, you are comparing a six-year project with two consecutive three-year projects\nso that both options will generate cash inflows for six years.

The lack of any debt in the capital structure means the firm\nwould have no financial leverage. The equity in a firm that has no financial leverage is called unlevered\nequity.\nThe Levered Firm\nNext, consider borrowing some of the money that you will need to start this T-shirt business. Although the\ncash flows from the business are uncertain, suppose you are certain that the business will generate at least\n$18,000. (Perhaps you have a guaranteed order from the cycling competition sponsors.) If you borrowed\n$17,000 at the risk-free interest rate of 4%, you would owe\nto the lenders at the\nend of the year. Because you are certain that you will generate at least $18,000 in cash, which is greater than\n$17,680, you can borrow the $17,000 without any risk of defaulting.\nThe $17,000 will not be enough to pay for all the start-up costs. You will also need to raise some capital by\nselling equity. Because your firm will have some debt, or financial leverage, the equity that you raise will be\nknown as levered equity.

Thus far in the chapter, the cost of equity capital calculations have assumed that\nthe earnings were being retained for equity capital financing.\nThe net income that is left after all expenses are paid is the residual income that belongs to the shareholders.\nInstead of receiving a fixed payment for letting the firm use their capital (like bondholders who receive fixed\ninterest payments), the reward to shareholders for letting the company use their capital varies from year to\nyear. In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth. Shareholders are willing to allow the company to retain these\nearnings because they expect that the money will be used to fund profitable projects, leading to an even larger\nreward for shareholders in future years.\nAlthough managers do not need to actively solicit the funds that are retained to fund the business, managers\ncannot view these funds as costless. The shareholders will require a return on those funds to entice them to\nallow the company to delay paying the dollars to them immediately in terms of a dividend.\nSuppose a company has $1 million in net income one year. If it pays $250,000 in dividends and retains\n$750,000, then it can finance $750,000 more in assets. If the company has a capital structure of 25% debt and\n75% equity and wants to maintain that capital structure, it must increase its debt by $250,000 to balance the\nincrease in equity.

This is called forecasting. Accounting and finance professionals use past performance\nalong with what they know about the business, its competitors, the economy, and the company’s plans for the\nfuture to assemble detailed financial forecasts. Forecasts are useful to many individuals for different reasons.\nA budget, a type of static forecast, helps accountants and managers see how their plans for the coming year\ncan be achieved. It outlines sales targets and how much can be spent on cost of goods sold and expenses to\nachieve the company’s bottom-line (net income) targets. Investors use financial forecasts to help guide their\ndecisions to buy, sell or hold stocks or to estimate future potential income through dividends. Perhaps most\nimportantly, for our purposes in finance, forecasts are used to help predict and manage cash flows.\nA business can have all the profit in the world at the end of the year, but if it doesn’t raise enough cash\n(liquidity) to pay the bills and pay its employees halfway through the year, it could still go bankrupt despite\nbeing profitable. Forecasting sales and expenses helps assemble a cash forecast—when sales will be collected\nand when expenses will be paid—so that financial managers can look forward far enough to have enough time\nto react accordingly and secure short- or long-term financing to meet gaps in cash flow.\nFinancial Forecasting\n18\n18 • Why It Matters\n535\n18.1\nThe Importance of Forecasting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss how to use financial statements in forecasting firm financials.\n•\nExplain why balance sheet items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\n•\nExplain why income statement items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\nIn this section, we will briefly review some of the basic elements of financial statements and how we can",

Managers can forecast cash flow using data from forecasted financial\nstatements; this allows them to identify potential gaps in cash and plan ahead in order to either alter collection\nand payment policies or obtain funding to cover the gap in the timing of cash flows.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPro Forma Financial Statements\nReview the video Business Plan and Pro-Forma Financial Statements (https://openstax.org/r/\nBusiness_Plan_and_Pro-Forma_Financial_Statements) to learn about the basics of pro forma financial\nstatements and why they are helpful.\n544\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLength of a Forecast\nForecasts can generally be for any length of time. The length generally depends on the user’s needs. A one-\nyear forecast, broken down by month, is quite typical. A firm will often go through a formal budgeting process\nnear the end of its calendar or fiscal year to project financial plans and goals for the coming year. Once that is\ndone, a rolling financial forecast is then done monthly to adjust as time moves on, more information becomes\navailable, and circumstances change.\nTo be useful, the future forecast for financial planning purposes is almost always calculated as monthly\nincrements rather than one total figure for the next 12 months. Breaking the data down by month allows\nfinance managers to more clearly see fluctuations in cash flows in and out, identify potential gaps in cash flow,\nand plan ahead for their cash needs.\nForecasts can also be done for several years into the future. In fact, they commonly are. However, once the\nfirm is looking out beyond 12 months, it gets difficult to forecast items with a great degree of accuracy. Often,\nforecasts beyond a year will be completed only to quarterly or even annual figures rather than monthly.\nForecasts that far into the future are often strategic in nature, made more to communicate future plans for the\nfirm than for more detailed decision-making and cash flow planning.\nCommon-Size Financials\nAs we saw earlier in the chapter, common-size analysis involves using historical financial statements as a basis\nfor future forecasts.

Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),\nand the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other\nexpenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.\nWe learned in Financial Statements that net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.\nIt’s also common to find other general policies or procedures that help drive performance and aid in\nforecasting balances. For example, if the company has a goal of maintaining a certain level of inventory or a\nminimum balance in its cash account, that information can be used to guide the estimate for those accounts.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n549\n18.5\nForecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a cash flow forecast.\n•\nAssess a cash flow forecast to determine future cash funding needs.\n•\nUse pro forma financial statements and cash flow forecasts to assess the value of growth to the firm.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will use the forecasted income statement, forecasted balance sheet, and\nother information we know about the firm’s policies and goals for the coming year to generate and assess a\ncash flow forecast.\nCreate a Cash Flow Forecast\nA cash flow forecast isn’t overly complex, yet it is not easy to assemble because it requires making many\nassumptions about the future. A cash forecast begins with the beginning cash balance, adds anticipated cash\ninflows, and deducts anticipated cash outflows. This identifies cash surpluses and shortages.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, we see in Figure 18.15 that the company begins with cash of\n$42,581,000 in January of the new year. Next, it lists the cash inflows, or cash received from customers. Given\nthe assumption that customers pay in 90-day terms, the cash flow is filled in by plugging in the sales forecast\nfor the three prior months. For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the\nnet sales forecast for March (see Figure 18.13).",

Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods\nsold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, in Figure 18.16, we\nsee that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted\nincome statement.\nSalaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent. Utilities,\nlike accounts payable, are assumed to be paid within 30 days. Thus, the cash outflow for utilities is the utilities\nexpense for the prior month from the forecasted income statement.\nManagement intends to pay a quarterly dividend of $10,000. Thus, in Figure 18.16, we see $10,000 cash\noutflows forecasted for March, June, September, and December. Interest on the long-term liability is paid\nquarterly.

This identifies\nwhether a cash surplus (extra) or cash deficit (not enough) exists for each month. For example, in Figure\n18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,\nwhich results in a cash deficit of $13,000.\nClear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess\ntheir monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,\nthe deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that\nthe company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March. It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth",

Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase",

The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities.

In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company.

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments.

The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due.

For example, assume that a 12-month cash budget is prepared for a period covering January 20X1 to\nDecember 20X1. Once the month of January 20X1 has concluded, a 12-month planning period continues by\nadd January 20X2 to the last column of the budget. The rolling cash monthly budget is an extension of the\ninitial cash budget model, adding one month and thereby always extending cash flow projections one year\ninto the future.\nFigure 19.9 Operating Expenses Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n587\nFigure 19.10 Sample Cash Budget\nUsing Figure 19.9 as an example, Table 19.5 shows the formulas that form the skeleton of a monthly cash\nbudget.\nBeginning\nCash Balance\nThis is the amount of cash the company expects to have on the first day of the month.

The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables.

Even a company that is not involved in international transactions can face this type of risk. Consider a\ncompany located in Mississippi that makes shirts using 100% US-grown cotton. All of the shirts are made in the\nUnited States and sold to retail outlets in the United States. Thus, all of the company’s expenses and revenues\nare in US dollars, and the company holds no assets outside of the United States.\nAlthough this firm has no financial transactions involving international currency, it can be impacted by\nchanges in exchange rates. Suppose the US dollar strengthens relative to the Vietnamese dong. This will allow\nUS retail outlets to purchase more Vietnamese dong, and thus more shirts from Vietnamese suppliers, for the\nsame amount of US dollars. Because of this, the retail outlets experience a drop in the cost of procuring the\nVietnamese shirts relative to the shirts produced by the firm in Mississippi. The Mississippi company will lose\nsome of its customers to these Vietnamese producers simply because of a change in the exchange rate.\nHedging\nJust as companies may practice hedging techniques to reduce their commodity risk exposure, they may\nchoose to hedge to reduce their currency risk exposure. The types of futures contracts that we discussed\nearlier in this chapter exist for currencies as well as for commodities. A company that knows that it will need\nKorean won later this year to purchase raw materials from a South Korean supplier, for example, can purchase\na futures contract for Korean won.\nWhile futures contracts allow companies to lock in prices today for a future commitment, these contracts are\nnot flexible enough to meet the risk management needs of all companies. Futures contracts are standardized\ncontracts. This means that the contracts have set sizes and maturity dates. Futures contracts for Korean won,\nfor example, have a contract size of 125 million won. A company that needs 200 million won later this year\nwould need to either purchase one futures contract, hedging only a portion of its needs, or purchase two\nfutures contracts, hedging more than it needs.

For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is\n, then the company will choose to exercise\nthe option.

Then the writer of the option will be obligated to sell the Korean\nwon at a price of KWN 1,200/USD. If the spot rate is\n, the option writer will be obligated\nto sell the dollars for KWN 50 less than what they are worth; because the option writer was initially paid a KWN\n50 premium for taking on that obligation, the option writer will just break even. For any exchange rate higher\nthan\n, the writer of the call option will have a loss.\nThe option contract is a zero-sum game. Any payoff the owner of the option receives is exactly equal to the\nloss the writer of the option has. Any loss the owner of the option has is exactly equal to the payoff the writer\nof the option receives.\nPut Options\nWhile the call option you just considered gives the owner the right to buy an underlying asset, the put option\ngives the owner to right to sell an underlying asset. Take, for example, an Indian company that has a contract\nto provide graphic artwork for a US company. The US company will pay the Indian company 200,000 US dollars\nin three months.\nWhile the Indian company receives US dollars, it must pay its workers in Indian rupees. Because the company\ndoes not know what the spot exchange rate will be in three months, it faces transaction risk and may be\ninterested in hedging this exposure using a put option.\nThe company knows that the current spot rate is\n, meaning that the company would be able\nto use $200,000 to purchase\nif it possessed the $200,000 today. If\nthe Indian rupee appreciates relative to the US dollar over the next three months, however, the company will\nreceive fewer rupees when it makes the exchange; perhaps the company will not be able to purchase enough\nrupees to cover the wages of its employees.\nAssume the company can purchase a put option that gives it the right to sell US dollars in three months at a\nstrike price of INR 75/USD; the premium for this put option is INR 5. By purchasing this put option, the\ncompany is spending INR 5 to guarantee that it can sell its US dollars for rupees in three months at a price of\nINR 75/USD.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n611\nIf, in three months, when the company receives payment in US dollars, the spot exchange rate is higher than\n, the company will simply exchange the US dollars for rupees at that exchange rate, allowing",

The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most\ncommonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can\nborrow money at rate equal to\n; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.\nIf the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLIBOR Transition\nAlthough the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial\ninstruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit the About LIBOR\nTransition (https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition) website.\nBeta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher\ninterest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit. Table 20.5\nsummarizes the situation and the rates at which Alpha and Beta can borrow. It also illustrates a way in which\nan interest rate swap can benefit both Alpha and Beta.\nAlpha\nBeta\nBond rating\nAAA\nBBB\nFloating rate\nFixed rate\n5\n6.75\nRate company chooses\nFixed at 5.0\nFloating at\nSwap\nN/A\nN/A\nBeta pays Alpha fixed rate\n5.5\n-5.5\nTable 20.5 Example of a Swap Agreement\n616\n20 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAlpha\nBeta\nAlpha pays Beta floating rate\n-LIBOR\n+LIBOR\nPayments and receipts\nNet amount\n-6.25\nBenefit\n0.75\n0.5\nTable 20.5 Example of a Swap Agreement",
