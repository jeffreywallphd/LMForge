That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence.",

Positivist law, on the other hand, is based on the belief that the law is created by human beings through their laws and institutions, and that it is subject to change and evolution.

The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence. \nSome Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to \noverturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n11 \nRelated to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought. This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nEach of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource. Which school of legal thought does \nher criticism reflect? \n2. Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” \nWhich school of legal thought is represented by this quote? \n3. Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard \nunder Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual \nextermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald. After an Israeli “extraction team” took him \nfrom Argentina to Israel, he was put on trial for “crimes against humanity.” His defense was that he was \n“just following orders.” Explain why Eichmann was not an adherent of the natural-law school of legal \nthought. \n \n  \n \n[1] Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, s.v. “natural law.” \n[2] Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” \n \n \n \n1.3 Basic Concepts and Categories of US Positive Law \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Contract law and tort law are two different types of laws that govern legal relationships between individuals and businesses. Contract law governs the formation and enforcement of contracts, while tort law governs the legal remedies for wrongful acts or injuries caused by one party to another. Contract law is based on the principle of consent, which means that both parties must agree to the terms of the contract in order for it to be legally binding. In contrast, tort law is based on the principle of negligence, which means that one party may be held liable for causing harm or injury to another party if they failed to take reasonable care to prevent the harm from occurring. For example, if a business fails to provide a safe working environment and an employee is injured as a result, the business may be held liable under tort law for the employee's injuries. On the other hand, if an employee fails to perform their duties in accordance with the terms of their employment contract, the employer may be able to enforce the contract through contract law. In general, contract law is used to enforce the terms of a contract, while tort law is used to provide a legal remedy for wrongful acts or injuries."

                    "answer": "Law plays an important role in supporting ethical norms in our society by providing a framework for resolving disputes and enforcing agreements. By setting clear rules and standards for behavior, law helps to create a stable and predictable environment in which individuals and businesses can operate. This, in turn, promotes trust and cooperation, which are essential for the smooth functioning of society. For example, laws that protect the rights of workers, such as minimum wage laws and labor standards, help to ensure that workers are treated fairly and are paid a fair wage for their labor. Similarly, laws that protect the environment, such as regulations on air and water pollution, help to ensure that businesses and individuals are held accountable for their impact on the environment. By promoting ethical behavior and protecting the rights of individuals and businesses, law helps to create a more just and equitable society."

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts.

The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code.

The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year.

Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases. How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A holding is the \ncourt’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the \nmeaning of the case as a precedent for future cases. \n \nBeyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to \nunderstand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought) \neach trial or appellate judge believes in.

As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment. Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct \nalleged in Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments “‘so heavily polluted with \ndiscrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group \nworkers,’” Id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. \n957,32 L. Ed. 2d 343, 92 S. Ct. 2058 (1972), merely present some especially egregious examples of \nharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what is actionable. \n \nWe therefore believe the District Court erred in relying on whether the conduct “seriously affected \nplaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test.

But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while \npsychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is \nrequired. \n \nIII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n37 \nForklift, while conceding that a requirement that the conduct seriously affect psychological well-\nbeing is unfounded, argues that the District Court nonetheless correctly applied the Meritor \nstandard. We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.” \n \nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nSo ordered. \n \nNote to Students \n \nThis was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case. Many \nfeminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile-working-\nenvironment claims under Title VII more difficult to win. That did not happen. When the question to be \ndecided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case. Here, the question that the \ncourt poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological \ninjury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the \ncourt revisits a similar question and answers it differently. This does happen, but happens rarely. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Is this a criminal case or a civil-law case? How can you tell? \n2. Is the court concerned with making a procedural rule here, or is the court making a statement about the \nsubstantive law? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n38 \n3. Is this a case where the court is interpreting the Constitution, a federal statute, a state statute, or the \ncommon law? \n4. In Harris v. Forklift, what if the trial judge does not personally agree that women should have any rights to \nequal treatment in the workplace? Why shouldn’t that judge dismiss the case even before trial? Or should \nthe judge dismiss the case after giving the female plaintiff her day in court? \n5. What was the employer’s argument in this case? Do you agree or disagree with it? What if those who \nlegislated Title VII gave no thought to the question of seriousness of injury at all? \n \n \n \n \n1.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThere are differing conceptions of what law is and of what law should be. Laws and legal systems differ \nworldwide. The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government.

An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each. The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money.

In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct \nthan achieving the right results. A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society,",

If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation.

Insofar as his actions…reduce returns to stockholders, he is spending their \nmoney. Insofar as his actions raise the price to customers, he is spending the customers’ money. \nInsofar as his actions lower the wages of some employees, he is spending their money. \n \nThis process raises political questions on two levels: principle and consequences. On the level of \npolitical principle, the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of tax proceeds are governmental \nfunctions. We have established elaborate constitutional, parliamentary, and judicial provisions to \ncontrol these functions, to assure that taxes are imposed so far as possible in accordance with the \npreferences and desires of the public.… \n \n \nOthers have challenged the notion that corporate managers have no real duties except toward the owners \n(shareholders). By changing two letters in shareholder, stakeholder theorists widened the range of people \nand institutions that a corporation should pay moral consideration to. Thus they contend that a \ncorporation, through its management, has a set of responsibilities toward nonshareholder interests. \n \nStakeholder Theory \nStakeholders of a corporation include its employees, suppliers, customers, and the community. \nStakeholder is a deliberate play on the word shareholder, to emphasize that corporations have obligations \nthat extend beyond the bottom-line aim of maximizing profits. A stakeholder is anyone who most would \nagree is significantly affected (positively or negatively) by the decision of another moral agent. \n \nThere is one vital fact about corporations: the corporation is a creation of the law. Without law (and \ngovernment), corporations would not have existence. The key concept for corporations is the legal fact of \nlimited liability. The benefit of limited liability for shareholders of a corporation meant that larger pools of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n69 \ncapital could be aggregated for larger enterprises; shareholders could only lose their investments should \nthe venture fail in any way, and there would be no personal liability and thus no potential loss of personal \nassets other than the value of the corporate stock. Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be",

Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven.

If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n73 \nIf you manage by the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers, based on the need to get \nstock price ever higher. At Enron, “15 percent a year or better earnings growth” was the mantra. Jeffrey \nPfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, observes how the belief that “stock \nprice is all that matters” has been hardwired into the corporate psyche. It dictates not only how people \njudge the worth of their company but also how they feel about themselves and the work that they are \ndoing. And, over time, it has clouded judgments about what is acceptable corporate behavior. [6] \n \nManaging by Numbers: The Sears Auto Center Story \nIf winning is the most important thing in your life, then you must be prepared to do anything to \nwin. \n—Michael Josephson \n \nMost people want to be winners or associate with winners. As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers. But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs.

Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year \nperiod. New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n• \nThe long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to \nmeasure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially. \n• \nSears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant \ninformation about the service being offered. This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier. Sears, like other \nsellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would \nnot permit such information distortions. \n• \nPeople in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary. \n \nNoting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had \nlost sight of other goals for the organization. \n \nThe emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical. The \ntemptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write \nthe history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done. In a way, this \nfits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. \n \nConscious Capitalism \nOne effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious \ncapitalism movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7]",

Understanding the long-standing \nperspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting \nout the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses. Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices. A firm that has purpose and passion \nbeyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself \nfor long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nConsider again Milton Friedman’s article. \na. What does Friedman mean by “ethical custom”? \nb. If the laws of the society are limiting the company’s profitability, would the company be within \nits rights to disobey the law? \nc. \nWhat if the law is “on the books,” but the company could count on a lack of enforcement from \nstate officials who were overworked and underpaid? Should the company limit its profits? \nSuppose that it could save money by discharging a pollutant into a nearby river, adversely \naffecting fish and, potentially, drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities. In \npolluting against laws that aren’t enforced, is it still acting “within the rules of the game”? What \nif almost all other companies in the industry were saving money by doing similar acts? \n2 \nConsider again the Harris v.

A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states). Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85 \nOne familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases \ninvolving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for \nconsiderably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000). The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels.

Explain the concept of subject matter jurisdiction and distinguish it from personal jurisdiction. \n2. Understand how and where the US Constitution provides a set of instructions as to what federal courts are \nempowered by law to do. \n3. Know which kinds of cases must be heard in federal courts only. \n4. Explain diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and be able to decide whether a case is eligible for diversity \njurisdiction in the federal courts. \n \n \nJurisdiction is an essential concept in understanding courts and the legal system. Jurisdiction is a \ncombination of two Latin words: juris (law) and diction(to speak). Which court has the power “to \nspeak the law” is the basic question of jurisdiction. \n \nThere are two questions about jurisdiction in each case that must be answered before a judge will \nhear a case: the question of subject matter jurisdiction and the question of personal jurisdiction. \nWe will consider the question of subject matter jurisdiction first, because judges do; if they \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n90 \ndetermine, on the basis of the initial documents in the case (the “pleadings”), that they have no \npower to hear and decide that kind of case, they will dismiss it. \n \nThe Federal-State Balance: Federalism \nState courts have their origins in colonial era courts. After the American Revolution, state courts \nfunctioned (with some differences) much like they did in colonial times. The big difference after 1789 was \nthat state courts coexisted with federal courts. Federalism was the system devised by the nation’s \nfounders in which power is shared between states and the federal government. This sharing requires a \ndivision of labor between the states and the federal government. It is Article III of the US Constitution \nthat spells out the respective spheres of authority (jurisdiction) between state and federal courts. \n \nTake a close look at Article III of the Constitution. (You can find a printable copy of the Constitution \nat http://www.findlaw.com.) Article III makes clear that federal courts are courts of limited power or \njurisdiction. Notice that the only kinds of cases federal courts are authorized to deal with have strong \nfederal connections. For example, federal courts have jurisdiction when a federal law is being used by the \nplaintiff or prosecutor (a “federal question” case) or the case arises “in admiralty” (meaning that the \nproblem arose not on land but on sea, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any state, or in navigable \nwaters within the United States). Implied in this list is the clear notion that states would continue to have \ntheir own laws, interpreted by their own courts, and that federal courts were needed only where the issues \nraised by the parties had a clear federal connection. The exception to this is diversity jurisdiction, \ndiscussed later. \n \nThe Constitution was constructed with the idea that state courts would continue to deal with basic kinds \nof claims such as tort, contract, or property claims. Since states sanction marriages and divorce, state \ncourts would deal with “domestic” (family) issues. Since states deal with birth and death records, it stands \nto reason that paternity suits, probate disputes, and the like usually wind up in state courts. You wouldn’t \ngo to the federal building or courthouse to get a marriage license, ask for a divorce, or probate a will: these \nmatters have traditionally been dealt with by the states (and the thirteen original colonies before them). \nMatters that historically get raised and settled in state court under state law include not only domestic and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n91 \nprobate matters but also law relating to corporations, partnerships, agency, contracts, property, torts, and \ncommercial dealings generally. You cannot get married or divorced in federal court, because federal \ncourts have no jurisdiction over matters that are historically (and are still) exclusively within the domain \nof state law. \n \nIn terms of subject matter jurisdiction, then, state courts will typically deal with the kinds of disputes just \ncited. Thus if you are Michigan resident and have an auto accident in Toledo with an Ohio resident and \nyou each blame each other for the accident, the state courts would ordinarily resolve the matter if the \ndispute cannot otherwise be settled.

The \ncourt there could hear it (having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction \nover Bobby) but would apply New Mexico law, which governs motor vehicle laws and \naccidents in New Mexico. Why would the Texas judge do that? \n(b) The Texas judge knows that which state’s law is chosen to apply to the case can make \na decisive difference in the case, as different states have different substantive law \nstandards. For example, in a breach of contract case, one state’s version of the \nUniform Commercial Code may be different from another’s, and which one the court \ndecides to apply is often exceedingly good for one side and dismal for the other. \nIn Anna v. Bobby, if Texas has one kind of comparative negligence statute and New \nMexico has a different kind of comparative negligence statute, who wins or loses, or \nhow much is awarded, could well depend on which law applies. Because both were \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n96 \nunder the jurisdiction of New Mexico’s laws at the time, it makes sense to apply New \nMexico law. \n(3) Why do some nonresident defendants prefer to be in federal court? \n(a) In the state court, the judge is elected, and the jury may be familiar with or \nsympathetic to the “local” plaintiff. \n(b) The federal court provides a more neutral forum, with an appointed, life-tenured \njudge and a wider pool of potential jurors (drawn from a wider geographical area). \n(4) If a defendant does not want to be in state court and there is diversity, what is to be done? \n(a) Make a motion for removal to the federal court. \n(b) The federal court will not want to add to its caseload, or docket, but must take the \ncase unless there is not complete diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy \nis less than $75,000. \n \n \nTo better understand subject matter jurisdiction in action, let’s take an example. Wile E. Coyote wants a \nfederal judge to hear his products-liability action against Acme, Inc., even though the action is based on \nstate law. Mr. Coyote’s attorney wants to “make a federal case” out of it, thinking that the jurors in the \nfederal district court’s jury pool will understand the case better and be more likely to deliver a “high value” \nverdict for Mr. Coyote. Mr. Coyote resides in Arizona, and Acme is incorporated in the state of Delaware \nand has its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. The federal court in Arizona can hear and \ndecide Mr. Coyote’s case (i.e., it has subject matter jurisdiction over the case) because of diversity of \ncitizenship. If Mr. Coyote was injured by one of Acme’s defective products while chasing a roadrunner in \nArizona, the federal district court judge would hear his action—using federal procedural law—and decide \nthe case based on the substantive law of Arizona on product liability. \n \nBut now change the facts only slightly: Acme is incorporated in Delaware but has its principal place of",

In Section 3.8 \"Alternative Means of \nResolving Disputes\", we will discuss other dispute-resolution forums, such as arbitration and mediation. \nFor now, let us consider how courts make decisions in civil disputes. Judicial decision making in the \ncontext of litigation (civil lawsuits) is a distinctive form of dispute resolution. \n \nFirst, to get the attention of a court, the plaintiff must make a claim based on existing laws. Second, courts \ndo not reach out for cases. Cases are brought to them, usually when an attorney files a case with the right \ncourt in the right way, following the various laws that govern all civil procedures in a state or in the federal \nsystem. (Most US states’ procedural laws are similar to the federal procedural code.) \n \nOnce at the court, the case will proceed through various motions (motions to dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction, for example, or insufficient service of process), the proofs (submission of evidence), and the \narguments (debate about the meaning of the evidence and the law) of contesting parties. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n99 \nThis is at the heart of the adversary system, in which those who oppose each other may attack the other’s \ncase through proofs and cross-examination. Every person in the United States who wishes to take a case \nto court is entitled to hire a lawyer. The lawyer works for his client, not the court, and serves him as an \nadvocate, or supporter. The client’s goal is to persuade the court of the accuracy and justness of his \nposition. The lawyer’s duty is to shape the evidence and the argument—the line of reasoning about the \nevidence—to advance his client’s cause and persuade the court of its rightness. The lawyer for the \nopposing party will be doing the same thing, of course, for her client. The judge (or, if one is sitting, the \njury) must sort out the facts and reach a decision from this cross-fire of evidence and argument. \n \nThe method of adjudication—the act of making an order or judgment—has several important features. \nFirst, it focuses the conflicting issues. Other, secondary concerns are minimized or excluded altogether. \nRelevance is a key concept in any trial. The judge is required to decide the questions presented at the trial, \nnot to talk about related matters. Second, adjudication requires that the judge’s decision be reasoned, and \nthat is why judges write opinions explaining their decisions (an opinion may be omitted when the verdict \ncomes from a jury). Third, the judge’s decision must not only be reasoned but also be responsive to the \ncase presented: the judge is not free to say that the case is unimportant and that he therefore will ignore it. \nUnlike other branches of government that are free to ignore problems pressing upon them, judges must \ndecide cases. (For example, a legislature need not enact a law, no matter how many people petition it to do \nso.) Fourth, the court must respond in a certain way. The judge must pay attention to the parties’ \narguments and his decision must result from their proofs and arguments. Evidence that is not presented \nand legal arguments that are not made cannot be the basis for what the judge decides. Also, judges are \nbound by standards of weighing evidence: the burden of proof in a civil case is generally a “preponderance \nof the evidence.” \n \nIn all cases, the plaintiff—the party making a claim and initiating the lawsuit (in a criminal case the \nplaintiff is the prosecution)—has the burden of proving his case. If he fails to prove it, the defendant—the \nparty being sued or prosecuted—will win. \nCriminal prosecutions carry the most rigorous burden of proof: the government must prove its case \nagainst the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, even if it seems very likely that the defendant \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n100 \ncommitted the crime, as long as there remains some reasonable doubt—perhaps he was not clearly \nidentified as the culprit, perhaps he has an alibi that could be legitimate—the jury must vote to acquit \nrather than convict. \n \nBy contrast, the burden of proof in ordinary civil cases—those dealing with contracts, personal injuries, \nand most of the cases in this book—is a preponderance of the evidence, which means that the plaintiff’s \nevidence must outweigh whatever evidence the defendant can muster that casts doubts on the plaintiff’s \nclaim. This is not merely a matter of counting the number of witnesses or of the length of time that they \ntalk: the judge in a trial without a jury (a bench trial), or the jury where one is impaneled, must apply the \npreponderance of evidence test by determining which side has the greater weight of credible, relevant \nevidence. \n \nAdjudication and the adversary system imply certain other characteristics of courts.

These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail. Cases can be decided \non the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the \ncourt can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks. (2) The defendant can move to \ndismiss the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to “state a claim on which relief can be \ngranted,” or on the basis that there is no subject matter jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, \nor on the basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is saying, in effect, \nthat even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by \nthe court. For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-\ncalled alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will \ndismiss the complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a \ndemurrer.) \n \nA third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment. If there is no triable \nquestion of fact or law, there is no reason to have a trial. For example, the plaintiff sues on a promissory \nnote and, at deposition (an oral examination under oath), the defendant admits having made no payment \non the note and offers no excuse that would be recognizable as a reason not to pay. There is no reason to \nhave a trial, and the court should grant summary judgment. \n \nDiscovery \nIf there is a factual dispute, the case will usually involve some degree of discovery, where each party tries \nto get as much information out of the other party as the rules allow. Until the 1940s, when discovery \nbecame part of civil procedure rules, a lawsuit was frequently a game in which each party hid as much \ninformation as possible and tried to surprise the other party in court. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n109 \nBeginning with a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in 1938 \nand subsequently followed by many of the states, the parties are entitled to learn the facts of the case \nbefore trial. The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a",

This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause. For \nexample, in the Robinsons’ case against Audi, the attorneys representing Audi will want to know if any \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n112 \nprospective jurors have ever owned an Audi, what their experience has been, and if they had a similar \nproblem (or worse) with their Audi that was not resolved to their satisfaction. If so, the defense attorney \ncould well believe that such a juror has a potential for a bias against her client. In that case, she could use \na challenge for cause, explaining to the judge the basis for her challenge. The judge, at her discretion, \ncould either accept the for-cause reason or reject it. \n \nEven if an attorney cannot articulate a for-cause reason acceptable to the judge, he may use one of several \nperemptory challenges that most states (and the federal system) allow. A trial attorney with many years of \nexperience may have a sixth sense about a potential juror and, in consultation with the client, may decide \nto use a peremptory challenge to avoid having that juror on the panel. \n \nAfter the jury is sworn and seated, the plaintiff’s lawyer makes an opening statement, laying out the \nnature of the plaintiff’s claim, the facts of the case as the plaintiff sees them, and the evidence that the \nlawyer will present. The defendant’s lawyer may also make an opening statement or may reserve his right \nto do so at the end of the plaintiff’s case. \n \nThe plaintiff’s lawyer then calls witnesses and presents the physical evidence that is relevant to her proof. \nThe direct testimony at trial is usually far from a smooth narration. The rules of evidence (that govern the \nkinds of testimony and documents that may be introduced at trial) and the question-and-answer format \ntend to make the presentation of evidence choppy and difficult to follow. \n \nAnyone who has watched an actual televised trial or a television melodrama featuring a trial scene will \nappreciate the nature of the trial itself: witnesses are asked questions about a number of issues that may \nor may not be related, the opposing lawyer will frequently object to the question or the form in which it is \nasked, and the jury may be sent from the room while the lawyers argue at the bench before the judge. \n \nAfter direct testimony of each witness is over, the opposing lawyer may conduct cross-examination. This \nis a crucial constitutional right; in criminal cases it is preserved in the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment \n(the right to confront one’s accusers in open court). The formal rules of direct testimony are then relaxed, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n113 \nand the cross-examiner may probe the witness more informally, asking questions that may not seem \nimmediately relevant. This is when the opposing attorney may become harsh, casting doubt on a witness’s \ncredibility, trying to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or not to be trusted. This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence. A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant. Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial.",

Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is. If it is favorable to the \nparty the judge thinks should win, she can rely on that verdict. If the verdict is for the other party, he can \ngrant the motion for judgment n.o.v. This is a safer way to proceed because if the judge is reversed on \nappeal, a new trial is not necessary. The jury’s verdict always can be restored, whereas without a jury \nverdict (as happens when a directed verdict is granted before the case goes to the jury), the entire case \nmust be presented to a new jury. Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") illustrates the \njudgment n.o.v. process in a case where the judge allowed the case to go to a jury that was overly \nsympathetic to the plaintiffs. \nRule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the authorization for federal judges making a \njudgment contrary to the judgment of the jury. Most states have a similar rule. \n \nRule 50(b) says, \nWhenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any \nreason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a \nlater determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Not later than 10 days after entry \nof judgment, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any \njudgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with the party’s \nmotion for a directed verdict.…[A] new trial may be prayed for in the alternative. If a verdict was \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n116 \nreturned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either \norder a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe purpose of a trial judge is to ensure justice to all parties to the lawsuit. The judge presides, instructs the \njury, and may limit who testifies and what they testify about what. In all of this, the judge will usually commit \nsome errors; occasionally these will be the kinds of errors that seriously compromise a fair trial for both \nparties. Errors that do seriously compromise a fair trial for both parties are prejudicial, as opposed to \nharmless. The appeals court must decide whether any errors of the trial court judge are prejudicial or not. \nIf a judge directs a verdict, that ends the case for the party who hasn’t asked for one; if a judge grants \njudgment n.o.v., that will take away a jury verdict that one side has worked very hard to get. Thus a judge \nmust be careful not to unduly favor one side or the other, regardless of his or her sympathies. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What if there was not a doctrine of res judicata? What would the legal system be like? \n2. Why do you think cross-examination is a “right,” as opposed to a “good thing”?

Understand the posttrial process—how appellate courts process appeals. \n2. Explain how a court’s judgment is translated into relief for the winning party. \n \n \nJudgment or Order \nAt the end of a trial, the judge will enter an order that makes findings of fact (often with the help of a jury) \nand conclusions of law. The judge will also make a judgment as to what relief or remedy should be given. \nOften it is an award of money damages to one of the parties. The losing party may ask for a new trial at \nthis point or within a short period of time following. Once the trial judge denies any such request, the \njudgment—in the form of the court’s order—is final. \n \nAppeal \nIf the loser’s motion for a new trial or a judgment n.o.v. is denied, the losing party may appeal but must \nordinarily post a bond sufficient to ensure that there are funds to pay the amount awarded to the winning \nparty. In an appeal, the appellant aims to show that there was some prejudicial error committed by the \ntrial judge. There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic \nidea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides. Enforcement \nof the court’s judgment—an award of money, an injunction—is usually stayed (postponed) until the \nappellate court has ruled. As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the \nparty defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent). \n \nDuring the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge.

In an adversarial system, the goal is to allow both sides to present their best case, and to allow the judge or jury to make a decision based on the evidence presented.  Cross-examination is a key part of this process, because it allows the opposing side to challenge the credibility of the witness and to test the accuracy of the witness's testimony.  Without cross-examination, it would be difficult for the opposing side to effectively challenge the witness's testimony, and the judge or jury would be left with an incomplete picture of the facts.  In a judicial system that did not allow cross-examination, the opposing side would not have a fair opportunity to challenge the witness's testimony, and the judge or jury would not have a complete picture of the facts.  This would make it difficult for the judge or jury to make an informed decision, and it would undermine the fairness of the judicial system."

You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore.

Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought?

So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave. If she does, she will not be \nincluded in an eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n123 \ncannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the \noutcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAnyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has \nstanding will be heard by the courts. Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to \nensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries. Class actions are \na way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1.

Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware). The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so \nthe federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate seats for every state, no matter how small. \nThe Senate was also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial nominations. The net effect \nof this today is that senators from a very small number of states can block treaties and other important \nlegislation. The power of small states is also magnified by the Senate’s cloture rule, which currently \nrequires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. \n \nBecause the Constitution often speaks in general terms (with broad phrases such as “due process” and \n“equal protection”), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those terms apply in specific cases. The \nUnited States is unique among industrialized democracies in having a Supreme Court that reserves for \nitself that exclusive power to interpret what the Constitution means. The famous case of Marbury v. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n143 \nMadison began that tradition in 1803, when the Supreme Court had marginal importance in the new \nrepublic. The decision in Bush v. Gore, decided in December of 2000, illustrates the power of the court to \nshape our destiny as a nation. In that case, the court overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court \nregarding the way to proceed on a recount of the Florida vote for the presidency. The court’s ruling was \npurportedly based on the “equal protection of the laws” provision in the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nFrom Marbury to the present day, the Supreme Court has articulated the view that the US Constitution \nsets the framework for all other US laws, whether statutory or judicially created. Thus any statute (or \nportion thereof) or legal ruling (judicial or administrative) in conflict with the Constitution is not \nenforceable. And as the Bush v. Gore decision indicates, the states are not entirely free to do what they \nmight choose; their own sovereignty is limited by their union with the other states in a federal sovereign. \n \nIf the Supreme Court makes a “bad decision” as to what the Constitution means, it is not easily \noverturned. Either the court must change its mind (which it seldom does) or two-thirds of Congress and \nthree-fourths of the states must make an amendment (Article V). \n \nBecause the Supreme Court has this power of judicial review, there have been many arguments about how \nit should be exercised and what kind of “philosophy” a Supreme Court justice should have. President \nRichard Nixon often said that a Supreme Court justice should “strictly construe” the Constitution and not \nadd to its language. Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” \nThe general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in \naccord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their \nown views and values. Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the \nConstitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics \nof the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as",

Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything \nthat moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of \nsomething instead of buying something. \n \nThus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing \nthat differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that \noriginate elsewhere. If Michigan were to let counties decide for themselves whether to take garbage from \noutside of the county or not, this could also be a discrimination based on a place of origin outside the \nstate. (Suppose, for instance, each county were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then \nall Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste from outside of Michigan, which is \ndiscriminatory.) [3] \n \nThe Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste requirements that did not differentiate on the \nbasis of origin. If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific hazards, then the law would apply \nequally to in-state and out-of-state garbage. Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could \nstill act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state \nwaste from coming into their own borders. But Congress has declined to do so. What follows is a \nstatement from one of the US senators from Michigan, Carl Levin, in 2003, regarding the significant \namounts of waste that were coming into Michigan from Toronto, Canada. \n \nDealing with Unwelcome Waste \nSenator Carl Levin, January 2003 \nMichigan is facing an intolerable situation with regard to the importation of waste from other \nstates and Canada. \n \nCanada is the largest source of waste imports to Michigan. Approximately 65 truckloads of waste \ncome in to Michigan per day from Toronto alone, and an estimated 110–130 trucks come in from \nCanada each day. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n156 \nThis problem isn’t going to get any better. Ontario’s waste shipments are growing as the Toronto \narea signs new contracts for waste disposal here and closes its two remaining landfills. At the \nbeginning of 1999, the Toronto area was generating about 2.8 million tons of waste annually, \nabout 700,000 tons of which were shipped to Michigan. By early this year, barring unforeseen \ndevelopments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal. \nWhy can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada? They say that after 20 years of searching they \nhave not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage. Ontario has about \n345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles. With six times the land mass, \nthat argument is laughable. \n \nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, for every five years of \ndisposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill \ncapacity. The environmental impacts on landfills, including groundwater contamination, noise \npollution and foul odors, are exacerbated by the significant increase in the use of our landfills \nfrom sources outside of Michigan. \n \nI have teamed up with Senator Stabenow and Congressman Dingell to introduce legislation that \nwould strengthen our ability to stop shipments of waste from Canada. \n \nWe have protections contained in a 17 year-old international agreement between the U.S. and \nCanada called the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste. \nThe U.S. and Canada entered into this agreement in 1986 to allow the shipment of hazardous \nwaste across the U.S./Canadian border for treatment, storage or disposal. In 1992, the two \ncountries decided to add municipal solid waste to the agreement. To protect both countries, the \nagreement requires notification of shipments to the importing country and it also provides that \nthe importing country may withdraw consent for shipments. Both reasons are evidence that these \nshipments were intended to be limited. However, the agreement’s provisions have not been \nenforced by the United States. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n157 \nCanada could not export waste to Michigan without the 1986 agreement, but the U.S. has not \nimplemented the provisions that are designed to protect the people of Michigan. Although those of \nus that introduced this legislation believe that the Environmental Protection Agency has the \nauthority to enforce this agreement, they have not done so. Our bill would require the EPA \n[Environmental Protection Agency] to enforce the agreement. \n \nIn order to protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Michigan and our environment, we \nmust consider the impact of the importation of trash on state and local recycling efforts, landfill",

Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that sets standards for \nforeign vessels to enter the navigable waters and ports of the United States. If a state creates a law that \nsets standards that conflict with the federal law or sets standards so burdensome that they interfere with \nfederal law, the doctrine of preemption will (in accordance with the supremacy clause) void the state \nlaw or whatever parts of it are inconsistent with federal law. \n \nBut Congress can allow what might appear to be inconsistencies; the existence of federal statutory \nstandards does not always mean that local and state standards cannot be more stringent. If California \nwants cleaner air or water than other states, it can set stricter standards—nothing in the Clean Water Act \nor Clean Air Act forbids the state from setting stricter pollution standards. As the auto industry well \nknows, California has set stricter standards for auto emissions. Since the 1980s, most automakers have \nmade both a federal car and a California car, because federal Clean Air Act emissions restrictions do not \npreempt more rigorous state standards. \n \nLarge industries and companies actually prefer regulation at the national level. It is easier for a large \ncompany or industry association to lobby in Washington, DC, than to lobby in fifty different states. \nAccordingly, industry often asks Congress to put preemptive language into its statutes. The tobacco \nindustry is a case in point. \n \nThe cigarette warning legislation of the 1960s (where the federal government required warning labels on \ncigarette packages) effectively preempted state negligence claims based on failure to warn. When the \nfamily of a lifetime smoker who had died sued in New Jersey court, one cause of action was the company’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n160 \nfailure to warn of the dangers of its product. The Supreme Court reversed the jury’s award based on the \nfederal preemption of failure to warn claims under state law.

When Congress chooses to expressly preempt state law, the \nonly question for courts becomes determining whether the challenged state law is one that the federal law \nis intended to preempt. Implied preemption presents more difficult issues. The court has to look beyond \nthe express language of federal statutes to determine whether Congress has “occupied the field” in which \nthe state is attempting to regulate, or whether a state law directly conflicts with federal law, or whether \nenforcement of the state law might frustrate federal purposes. \n \nFederal “occupation of the field” occurs, according to the court in Pennsylvania v. Nelson (1956), when \nthere is “no room” left for state regulation. Courts are to look to the pervasiveness of the federal scheme of \nregulation, the federal interest at stake, and the danger of frustration of federal goals in making the \ndetermination as to whether a challenged state law can stand. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n161 \nIn Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee (1984), the court, voting 5–4, found that a $10 million punitive damages \naward (in a case litigated by famed attorney Gerry Spence) against a nuclear power plant was not \nimpliedly preempted by federal law. Even though the court had recently held that state regulation of the \nsafety aspects of a federally licensed nuclear power plant was preempted, the court drew a different \nconclusion with respect to Congress’s desire to displace state tort law—even though the tort actions might \nbe premised on a violation of federal safety regulations. \n \nCipollone v. Liggett Group (1993) was a closely watched case concerning the extent of an express \npreemption provision in two cigarette labeling laws of the 1960s.

Your \nemployer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example, if drug testing of all \nemployees every week is done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of action to object \nbased on the Fourth Amendment. However, if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug \ntesting, employees have no constitutional arguments to make; they can simply leave that employer, or \nthey may pursue whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n167 \nFifth Amendment \nThe Fifth Amendment states, “No person shall be…deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” \n \nThe Fifth Amendment has three principal aspects: procedural due process, the takings clause, \nand substantive due process. In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents \ngovernment from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also \nconstitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair. This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger \nKing v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, \nbut the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely \ncontract with one another. Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down \nthat aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions. \nHowever, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of \nlaws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties.

Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties. The first category \nincludes most of the liberties expressly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Through a process known as \nselective incorporation, the court has interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nbar states from denying their residents the most important freedoms guaranteed in the first ten \namendments to the federal Constitution. Only the Third Amendment right (against involuntary \nquartering of soldiers) and the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury have not been made \napplicable to the states. Because these rights are still not applicable to state governments, the Supreme \nCourt is often said to have “selectively incorporated” the Bill of Rights into the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n169 \nThe second category of fundamental liberties includes those liberties that are not expressly stated in the \nBill of Rights but that can be seen as essential to the concepts of freedom and equality in a democratic \nsociety. These unstated liberties come from Supreme Court precedents, common law, moral philosophy, \nand deeply rooted traditions of US legal history. The Supreme Court has stressed that he \nword liberty cannot be defined by a definitive list of rights; rather, it must be viewed as a rational \ncontinuum of freedom through which every aspect of human behavior is protected from arbitrary \nimpositions and random restraints. In this regard, as the Supreme Court has observed, the due process \nclause protects abstract liberty interests, including the right to personal autonomy, bodily integrity, self-\ndignity, and self-determination. \n \nThese liberty interests often are grouped to form a general right to privacy, which was first recognized \nin Griswold v. Connecticut (Section 4.6.1), where the Supreme Court struck down a state statute \nforbidding married adults from using, possessing, or distributing contraceptives on the ground that the \nlaw violated the sanctity of the marital relationship. According to Justice Douglas’s plurality opinion, this \npenumbra of privacy, though not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, must be protected to establish \na buffer zone or breathing space for those freedoms that are constitutionally enumerated. \n \nBut substantive due process has seen fairly limited use since the 1930s. During the 1990s, the Supreme \nCourt was asked to recognize a general right to die under the doctrine of substantive due process. \nAlthough the court stopped short of establishing such a far-reaching right, certain patients may exercise a \nconstitutional liberty to hasten their deaths under a narrow set of circumstances. In Cruzan v.

                    "answer": "The Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties. The first category includes most of the liberties expressly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Through a process known as selective incorporation, the court has interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to bar states from denying their residents the most important freedoms guaranteed in the first ten amendments to the federal Constitution. Only the Third Amendment right (against involuntary quartering of soldiers) and the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury have not been made applicable to the states. Because these rights are still not applicable to state governments, the Supreme Court is often said to have “selectively incorporated” the Bill of Rights into the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The second category of fundamental liberties includes those liberties that are not expressly stated in the Bill of Rights but that can be seen as essential to the concepts of freedom and equality in a democratic society. These unstated liberties come from Supreme Court precedents, common law, moral philosophy, and deeply rooted traditions of US legal history."

In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages. The \nAlabama trial jury considered that BMW was engaging in a fraudulent practice and wanted to punish the \ndefendant for a number of frauds it estimated at somewhere around a thousand nationwide. The jury \nawarded not only the $4,000 in compensatory damages but also $4 million in punitive damages, which \nwas later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. On appeal to the US Supreme Court, the \ncourt found that punitive damages may not be “grossly excessive.” If they are, then they violate \nsubstantive due process. Whatever damages a state awards must be limited to what is reasonably \nnecessary to vindicate the state’s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. \n \n“Equal protection of the laws” is a phrase that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868. \nThe amendment provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.” This is the equal protection clause. It means that, generally speaking, \ngovernments must treat people equally. Unfair classifications among people or corporations will not be \npermitted. A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white \nchildren and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public \nservices, such as water fountains or restrooms. Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954). [6] \n \nGovernments make classifications every day, so not all classifications can be illegal under the equal \nprotection clause. People with more income generally pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n171 \nPeople with proper medical training are licensed to become doctors; people without that training cannot \nbe licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do practice medicine. To know what classifications are \npermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified. The court has \ncreated three classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by \nknowing how the court is likely to classify the case: \n \n• \nMinimal scrutiny: economic and social relations. Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights. Classifications based on any of these are \nalmost never upheld. \n \nUnder minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues \nare presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen. For example, suppose that the city council decreed that all street vendors must be women, thinking \nthat would attract even more tourism. A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner \ntest than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to \nsubstantially relate to important government objectives. Increasingly, courts have nullified government \nsex classifications as societal concern with gender equality has grown. (See Shannon Faulkner’s case \nagainst The Citadel, an all-male state school.) [7] \n \nSuppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could \ndrive a taxicab or be a street vendor. That kind of classification would be examined with strict scrutiny to \nsee if there was any compelling justification for it. As noted, classifications such as this one are almost \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n172 \nnever upheld. The law would be upheld only if it were necessary to promote a compelling state interest. \nVery few laws that have a racial or ethnic classification meet that test. \n \nThe strict scrutiny test will be applied to classifications involving racial and ethnic criteria as well as",

Connecticut \n381 U.S. 479 (U.S. Supreme Court 1965) \n \nA nineteenth-century Connecticut law made the use, possession, or distribution of birth control devices \nillegal. The law also prohibited anyone from giving information about such devices. The executive \ndirector and medical director of a planned parenthood association were found guilty of giving out such \ninformation to a married couple that wished to delay having children for a few years. The directors \nwere fined $100 each. \n \nThey appealed throughout the Connecticut state court system, arguing that the state law violated \n(infringed) a basic or fundamental right of privacy of a married couple: to live together and have sex \ntogether without the restraining power of the state to tell them they may legally have intercourse but \nnot if they use condoms or other birth control devices. At each level (trial court, court of appeals, and \nConnecticut Supreme Court), the Connecticut courts upheld the constitutionality of the convictions. \n \nPlurality Opinion by Justice William O. Douglass \n \nWe do not sit as a super legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch \neconomic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. The [Connecticut] law, however, operates \ndirectly on intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician’s role in one aspect of that relation. \n \n[Previous] cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by \nemanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.…Various guarantees create \nzones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one.…The \nThird Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers “in any house” in time of peace \nwithout the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy.  \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n175 \nThe Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \npapers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Fifth Amendment in its Self-\nIncrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which the government may not force \nhim to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: “The enumeration in the \nConstitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” \n \nThe Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described…as protection against all governmental invasions “of \nthe sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life.” We recently referred in Mapp v. Ohio…to the \nFourth Amendment as creating a “right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and \nparticularly reserved to the people.” \n \n[The law in question here], in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their \nmanufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by having a maximum destructive impact on [the marital] \nrelationship. Such a law cannot stand.…Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of \nmarital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of \nprivacy surrounding the marital relationship. \n \nWe deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than \nour school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate \nto the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in \nliving, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for \nas noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. \n \nMr. Justice Stewart, whom Mr. Justice Black joins, dissenting. \n \nSince 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I \nthink this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in \nthe oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the \nrelationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual’s moral, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n176 \nethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of \nbirth control should be available to all, so that each individual’s choice can be meaningfully made. But we \nare not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold \nthat it violates the United States Constitution. And that I cannot do. \n \nIn the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, \nthe Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. But the Court does not say which of these \nAmendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law. \n \n…",

Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce \nimposed by Iowa’s law. On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests. \nThe total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight and \nproblematical that it does not outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from \ninterferences that seriously impede it.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n181 \nThe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 612 F.2d 1064 (1979). It accepted the District Court’s \nfinding that 65-foot doubles were as safe as 55-foot singles. Id. at 1069. Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. Id. at 1070-1071. The combination of these exemptions \nweakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation. For these reasons, the \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened \ninterstate commerce. \n \nIowa appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 446 U.S. 950 (1980). We now affirm. \n \n \n \nII \nIt is unnecessary to review in detail the evolution of the principles of Commerce Clause adjudication. The \nClause is both a “prolific ‘ of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the \nstate[s].” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 336 U.S. 534 (1949). The Clause permits \nCongress to legislate when it perceives that the national welfare is not furthered by the independent \nactions of the States. It is now well established, also, that the Clause itself is “a limitation upon state power \neven without congressional implementation.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333 at 350 (1977). The Clause requires that some aspects of trade generally must remain free from \ninterference by the States. When a State ventures excessively into the regulation of these aspects of \ncommerce, it “trespasses upon national interests,” Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce. It has long been \nrecognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n182 \nstate to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect \ninterstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 \n(1945). \n \nThe extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure.

In the Court’s recent unanimous decision in Raymond we declined to “accept the \nState’s contention that the inquiry under the Commerce Clause is ended without a weighing of the \nasserted safety purpose against the degree of interference with interstate commerce.” This “weighing” by a \ncourt requires—and indeed the constitutionality of the state regulation depends on—“a sensitive \nconsideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern in light of the extent of the burden \nimposed on the course of interstate commerce.” Id. at 434 U.S. at 441; accord, Pike v.

Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded \nthe use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as \nin Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-\nfoot singles.

                    "answer": "The Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce. It has long been recognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945). The extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure. It may be said with confidence, however, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local concern. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350. For example, regulations that touch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to invalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited). Indeed, “if safety justifications are not illusory, the Court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison with related burdens on interstate commerce.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 449. Those who would challenge such bona fide safety regulations must overcome a “strong presumption of validity.” Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 at (1959). But the incantation of a purpose to promote the public health or safety does not insulate a state law from Commerce Clause attack. Regulations designed for that salutary purpose nevertheless may further the purpose so marginally, and interfere with commerce so substantially, as to be invalid under the Commerce Clause. In the Court’s recent unanimous decision in Raymond we declined to “accept the State’s contention that the inquiry under the Commerce Clause is ended without a weighing of the asserted safety purpose against the degree of interference with interstate commerce.” This “weighing” by a court requires—and indeed the constitutionality of the state regulation depends on—“a sensitive consideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern in light of the extent of the burden imposed on the course of interstate commerce.” Id. at 434 U.S. at 441; accord, Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 at 142 (1970);Bibb, supra, at 359 U.S. at 525-530. III Applying these general principles, we conclude that the Iowa truck length limitations unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce. In Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded the use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as in Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-foot singles. Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western States. Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck. In the absence of congressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must be tolerated. But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its regulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state law cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause."

Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than \nsingles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles. \n \nStatistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and \n60-foot doubles. One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative \naccident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles. Each kind of truck was driven 56 million \nmiles on identical routes. The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one \nfatality. The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Iowa’s \nexpert statistician admitted that this study provided “moderately strong evidence” that singles have a \nhigher injury rate than doubles. Another study, prepared by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the \nrequest of the state legislature, concluded that “[s]ixty-five foot twin trailer combinations have not been \nshown by experiences in other states to be less safe than 60-foot twin trailer \ncombinations or conventional tractor-semitrailers.” \n \nIn sum, although Iowa introduced more evidence on the question of safety than did Wisconsin \nin Raymond, the record as a whole was not more favorable to the State. \n \nB \nConsolidated, meanwhile, demonstrated that Iowa’s law substantially burdens interstate commerce. \nTrucking companies that wish to continue to use 65-foot doubles must route them around Iowa or detach \nthe trailers of the doubles and ship them through separately. Alternatively, trucking companies must use \nthe smaller 55-foot singles or 65-foot doubles permitted under Iowa law. Each of these options engenders \ninefficiency and added expense. The record shows that Iowa’s law added about $12.6 million each year to \nthe costs of trucking companies. \n \nConsolidated alone incurred about $2 million per year in increased costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n185 \n \nIn addition to increasing the costs of the trucking companies (and, indirectly, of the service to \nconsumers), Iowa’s law may aggravate, rather than, ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents. Fifty-\nfive-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles. Either more small trucks must be used to carry the \nsame quantity of goods through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks must drive longer distances to \nbypass Iowa. In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be \ndriven to transport the same quantity of goods. Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to \ndistance traveled. Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa’s law tends to increase the \nnumber of accidents and to shift the incidence of them from Iowa to other States. \n \n[IV.

Prior to the statute’s enactment,…apples from 13 different States were shipped into North \nCarolina for sale. Seven of those States, including [Washington], had their own grading systems which, \nwhile differing in their standards, used similar descriptive labels (e.g., fancy, extra fancy, etc.). This \nmultiplicity of inconsistent state grades [posed] dangers of deception and confusion not only in the North \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n188 \nCarolina market, but in the Nation as a whole. The North Carolina statute, appellants claim, was enacted \nto eliminate this source of deception and confusion. [Moreover], it is contended that North Carolina \nsought to accomplish this goal of uniformity in an evenhanded manner as evidenced by the fact that its \nstatute applies to all apples sold in closed containers in the State without regard to their point of origin. \n[As] the appellants properly point out, not every exercise of state authority imposing some burden on the \nfree flow of commerce is invalid, [especially] when the State acts to protect its citizenry in matters \npertaining to the sale of foodstuffs. By the same token, however, a finding that state legislation furthers \nmatters of legitimate local concern, even in the health and consumer protection areas, does not end the \ninquiry. Rather, when such state legislation comes into conflict with the Commerce Clause’s overriding \nrequirement of a national “common market,” we are confronted with the task of effecting an \naccommodation of the competing national and local interests. We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The \nrecord demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the \napple trade. [The record] contains numerous affidavits [stating a] preference [for] apples graded under \nthe Washington, as opposed to the USDA, system because of the former’s greater consistency, its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n189 \nemphasis on color, and its supporting mandatory inspections. Once again, the statute had no similar \nimpact on the North Carolina apple industry and thus operated to its benefit. \n \nThird, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, \nthe statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers. \n[With] free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage \nvis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior. However, because of \nthe statute’s operation, Washington apples which would otherwise qualify for and be sold under the \nsuperior Washington grades will now have to be marketed under their inferior USDA counterparts. Such \n“downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-\nof-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit. At worst, it will have the effect of an \nembargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them \nfrom the North Carolina market. At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that \nsuch apples would otherwise command. \n \nDespite the statute’s facial neutrality, the Commission suggests that its discriminatory impact on \ninterstate commerce was not an unintended by-product, and there are some indications in the record to",

Section 441b makes it a felony for all \ncorporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or \ndefeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election \nand 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n194 \nClub runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to \ndisapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association \npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports \na handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a \nPresidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic \nexamples of censorship. \n \nSection 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation \ncan still speak. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to \nextensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the \ntreasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve \nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within \n10 days. \n \nAnd that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at \ndifferent times depending on the type of election that is about to occur.… \n \nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the \nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs. PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. \nGiven the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views \nknown regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign. \nSection 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \n“restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a \ncampaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues \ndiscussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1 at 19 (1976).… \n \nSpeech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the \npeople. See Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n195 \ncitizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.”) The right of citizens to \ninquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-\ngovernment and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent \napplication’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” \n \nFor these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or \ninadvertence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the \nGovernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” \n \n… \n \nThe Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations.

This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves. \n \nWhat we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government. For the most \npart relinquishing the anti-distortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate \npolitical speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.… \n \nWhen Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may \nnot choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from \nindependent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before \nprinciple, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to \ndispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, \nmust comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is \nthe governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is \nnot a permissible remedy.

Hallock, 309 U.S. 106 at \n119 (1940). \n \nAustin is undermined by experience since its announcement. Political speech is so ingrained in our \nculture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws. See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U.S., at \n176–177 (“Given BCRA’s tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives…to \nexploit [26 U.S.C. §527] organizations will only increase”). Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and \ninformative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment \nrights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted \nmessages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic \nviews.

Describe how courts can be used to challenge administrative rulings. \n \n \nFrom the 1930s on, administrative agencies, law, and procedures have virtually remade our \ngovernment and much of private life. Every day, business must deal with rules and decisions of state \nand federal administrative agencies. Informally, such rules are often called regulations, and they \ndiffer (only in their source) from laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the president. The \nrules created by agencies are voluminous: thousands of new regulations pour forth each year. The \noverarching question of whether there is too much regulation—or the wrong kind of regulation—of \nour economic activities is an important one but well beyond the scope of this chapter, in which we \noffer an overview of the purpose of administrative agencies, their structure, and their impact on \nbusiness. \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n205 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.1 Administrative Agencies: Their Structure and Powers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain the reasons why we have federal administrative agencies. \n2. Explain the difference between executive branch agencies and independent agencies. \n3. Describe the constitutional issue that questions whether administrative agencies could have authority to \nmake enforceable rules that affect business. \n \n \nWhy Have Administrative Agencies? \nThe US Constitution mentions only three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial \n(Articles I, II, and III). There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution, even though federal agencies \nare sometimes referred to as “the fourth branch of government.” The Supreme Court has recognized the \nlegitimacy of federal administrative agencies to make rules that have the same binding effect as \nstatutes by Congress. \n \nMost commentators note that having agencies with rule-making power is a practical necessity: (1) \nCongress does not have the expertise or continuity to develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g., \ncommunications, the environment, aviation). (2) Because of this, it makes sense for Congress to set forth \nbroad statutory guidance to an agency and delegate authority to the agency to propose rules that further \nthe statutory purposes. (3) As long as Congress makes this delegating guidance sufficiently clear, it is not \ndelegating improperly. If Congress’s guidelines are too vague or undefined, it is (in essence) giving away \nits constitutional power to some other group, and this it cannot do. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n206 \nWhy Regulate the Economy at All? \nThe market often does not work properly, as economists often note. Monopolies, for example, happen in \nthe natural course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well.

The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, \nhowever, an example of destructive noncompetition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n208 \n \nOther market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation. For example, there is a need to regulate \nfrequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, \nnational defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something \nthat must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods \nsuch as education, a highway system, lighthouses, a military for defense. \n \nTrue laissez-faire capitalism—a market free from any regulation—would not try to deal with market \nimperfections and would also allow people to freely choose products, services, and other arrangements \nthat historically have been deemed socially unacceptable. These would include making enforceable \ncontracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or \ncrack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage \npartnership. \n \nThus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by \nwhat is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the \nsocial arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or \nunsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers \nfrom unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can \nbe used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment \ndiscrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and \nmonitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental \nProtection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company). \n \nHistory of Federal Agencies \nThrough the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between \nthe states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that \nindependent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may \ndirectly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may \noversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by \nCongress). \n \nPowers of Agencies \nAgencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal \nCommunications Act, gave them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive activity covered \nby the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power \nplant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, the move toward \nderegulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power. Many agencies also have the \nauthority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies \ncan regulate business practices. The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce \nto monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of \nthe stock exchanges. \n \nUnlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific \nassignment or reaching a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the \nday; they must act. They have been given legislative powers because in a society growing ever more \ncomplex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it \nhave the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely because they are to do what \ngeneral legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of experience in \ndealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish \ntheir statutory duties. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n211 \nAll administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel. The heads, whether a single \nadministrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively \nlimited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making \noccurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting \ndata and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies. \n \nThe Constitution and Agencies \nCongress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of \ngovernmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. \nThe most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another.

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision. The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency \nactions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 \"Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review\" on \n“Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAdministrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate. But these powers \nare limited by executive and legislative controls and by judicial review. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Find the website of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Identify from that site a product that \nhas been banned by the CPSC for sale in the United States. What reasons were given for its exclusion from \nthe US market? \n2.

Understand why the Administrative Procedure Act was needed. \n2. Understand how hearings are conducted under the act. \n3. Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer. The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more \naccurately reflect their duties. Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free \nof assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the \nagency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function. \nThe accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, \nto cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers.

But they \ndo not directly apply to nonparties, who may argue in a subsequent case that their conduct does not fit \nwithin the holding announced in the case. Agencies can affect future conduct far more directly by \nannouncing rules that apply to all who come within the agency’s jurisdiction. \n \nThe acts creating most of the major federal agencies expressly grant them authority to engage in \nrulemaking. This means, in essence, authority to legislate. The outpouring of federal regulations has been \nimmense. The APA directs agencies about to engage in rulemaking to give notice in the \nFederal Register of their intent to do so. The Federal Register is published daily, Monday through \nFriday, in Washington, DC, and contains notice of various actions, including announcements of proposed \nrulemaking and regulations as adopted.

Describe the paperwork burden imposed by administrative agencies. \n2. Explain why agencies have the power of investigation, and what limits there are to that power. \n3. Explain the need for the Freedom of Information Act and how it works in the US legal system. \n \n \nThe Paperwork Burden \nThe administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes. As long as each company engages in a single line of \nbusiness, data are comparable. When the era of conglomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent \ntypes of businesses brought together under the roof of a single corporate parent, the data became useless \nfor purposes of examining the competitive behavior of different industries. So the FTC ordered dozens of \nlarge companies to break out their economic information according to each line of business that they \ncarried on. The companies resisted, but the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \nwhere much of the litigation over federal administrative action is decided, directed the companies to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n220 \ncomply with the commission’s order, holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act clearly permits the \nagency to collect information for investigatory purposes. [1] \n \nIn 1980, responding to cries that businesses, individuals, and state and local governments were being \nswamped by federal demands for paperwork, Congress enacted the Paperwork Reduction Act. It gives \npower to the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop uniform policies for \ncoordinating the gathering, storage, and transmission of all the millions of reports flowing in each year to \nthe scores of federal departments and agencies requesting information. These reports include tax and \nMedicare forms, financial loan and job applications, questionnaires of all sorts, compliance reports, and \ntax and business records. The OMB was given the power also to determine whether new kinds of \ninformation are needed. In effect, any agency that wants to collect new information from outside must \nobtain the OMB’s approval. \n \nInspections \nNo one likes surprise inspections. A section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers \nagents of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to search work areas for safety \nhazards and for violations of OSHA regulations. The act does not specify whether inspectors are required \nto obtain search warrants, required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases. For many years, the \ngovernment insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a \nwarrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an",

Describe the “exhaustion of remedies” requirement. \n2. Detail various strategies for obtaining judicial review of agency rules. \n3. Explain under what circumstances it is possible to sue the government. \n \n \nNeither an administrative agency’s adjudication nor its issuance of a regulation is necessarily final. Most \nfederal agency decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts. To get to court, the appellant must \novercome numerous complex hurdles. He or she must have standing—that is, be in some sense directly \naffected by the decision or regulation. The case must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as \nfurther appeal within the agency must have been exhausted. \n \nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n224 \nBefore you can complain to court about an agency’s action, you must first try to get the agency to \nreconsider its action. Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing examiner level, there \nmust have been a decision reached that was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the decision \nto the full board. The full board must rule against you, and only then will you be heard by a court. The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose. See Section 5.6 \n\"Cases\", American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan. \n \nIn summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) \nchallenge agency action where such action is the following: \n \n• \nnot in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority \n• \nnot in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act \n• \nnot in accordance with the substantial evidence test \n• \nunwarranted by the facts \n•",

While it is difficult to show that \nan agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so held. For example, after the \nReagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies \nchallenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that \nthe agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record \nand the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies \nthus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased \npassenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured. [1] \n \nSuing the Government \nIn the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative \nagencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly \nlegitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their \nbounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have? \n \nMainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private \nindividuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n226 \nsovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route. [2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year.",

Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the \ncrime. \n \n \nTo be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient. But what \nconstitutes an act? This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead? The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison). States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense.

Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison capsule to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n259 \nswallow. That is the act. If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his \nstate of mind was. Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her, the act was murder. \nWhat if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison but believing that it would only make her \nmildly ill? The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that \nmay cause harm to others. But suppose that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her two \npills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) \nbut that turned out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he had neither intent nor a state of \nknowledge from which intent could be inferred. \n \nNot every criminal law requires criminal intent as an ingredient of the crime. Many regulatory codes \ndealing with the public health and safety impose strict requirements. Failure to adhere to such \nrequirements is a violation, whether or not the violator had mens rea. The United States v. \nPark case, Section 6.7 \"Cases\", a decision of the US Supreme Court, shows the different considerations \ninvolved in mens rea. \n \nExcuses That Limit or Overcome Responsibility \nMistake of Fact and Mistake of Law \nOrdinarily, ignorance of the law is not an excuse. If you believe that it is permissible to turn right on a red \nlight but the city ordinance prohibits it, your belief, even if reasonable, does not excuse your violation of \nthe law. Under certain circumstances, however, ignorance of law will be excused. If a statute imposes \ncriminal penalties for an action taken without a license, and if the government official responsible for \nissuing the license formally tells you that you do not need one (though in fact you do), a conviction for \nviolating the statute cannot stand. In rare cases, a lawyer’s advice, contrary to the statute, will be held to \nexcuse the client, but usually the client is responsible for his attorney’s mistakes. Otherwise, as it is said, \nthe lawyer would be superior to the law. \n \nIgnorance or mistake of fact more frequently will serve as an excuse. If you take a coat from a restaurant, \nbelieving it to be yours, you cannot be convicted of larceny if it is not. Your honest mistake of fact negates \nthe requisite intent. In general, the rule is that a mistaken belief of fact will excuse criminal responsibility \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n260 \nif (1) the belief is honestly held, (2) it is reasonable to hold it, and (3) the act would not have been criminal \nif the facts were as the accused supposed them to have been. \n \nEntrapment \nOne common technique of criminal investigation is the use of an undercover agent or decoy—the \npoliceman who poses as a buyer of drugs from a street dealer or the elaborate “sting” operations in which \nostensibly stolen goods are “sold” to underworld “fences.” Sometimes these methods are the only way by \nwhich certain kinds of crime can be rooted out and convictions secured. \n \nBut a rule against entrapment limits the legal ability of the police to play the role of criminals. The \npolice are permitted to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are not permitted to do so to",

The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis. In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of \nwhom is appointed for every federal district. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n263 \nFollowing the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document \nstating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury for \nan indictment. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence. The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment. The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff \nwill have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n264 \nFollowing a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will impose a sentence after presentencing \nreports are written by various court officials (often, probation officers). Permissible sentences are \nspelled out in statutes, though these frequently give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., \ntwenty years to life). The judge may sentence the defendant to imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may \ndecide to suspend sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence as long as he stays \nout of trouble). \n \nSentencing usually comes before appeal. As in civil cases, the defendant, now convicted, has the right \nto take at least one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and constitutional rights may \nbe argued. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCriminal procedure in US courts is designed to provide a fair process to both criminal defendants and to \nsociety. The grand jury system, prosecutorial discretion, plea bargains, and appeals for lack of a fair trial are all \npart of US criminal procedure. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating \nthe situation immediately and would be taking corrective action and would be preparing a summary of the \ncorrective action to reply to the letter.” Respondent stated that he did not “believe there was anything [he] \ncould have done more constructively than what [he] found was being done.” \n \nOn cross-examination, respondent conceded that providing sanitary conditions for food offered for sale to \nthe public was something that he was “responsible for in the entire operation of the company” and he \nstated that it was one of many phases of the company that he assigned to “dependable subordinates.” \nRespondent was asked about and, over the objections of his counsel, admitted receiving, the April 1970 \nletter addressed to him from the FDA regarding insanitary conditions at Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. \nHe acknowledged that, with the exception of the division vice president, the same individuals had \nresponsibility for sanitation in both Baltimore and Philadelphia. Finally, in response to questions \nconcerning the Philadelphia and Baltimore incidents, respondent admitted that the Baltimore problem \nindicated the system for handling sanitation “wasn’t working perfectly” and that as Acme’s chief executive \nofficer he was “responsible for any result which occurs in our company.” \n \nAt the close of the evidence, respondent’s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied. The \nrelevant portion of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury challenged by respondent is set out in the \nmargin. Respondent’s counsel objected to the instructions on the ground that they failed fairly to reflect \nour decision in United States v. Dotterweich supra, and to define “‘responsible relationship.’” The trial \njudge overruled the objection.

In Dotterweich, a jury had disagreed as to \nthe corporation, a jobber purchasing drugs from manufacturers and shipping them in interstate \ncommerce under its own label, but had convicted Dotterweich, the corporation’s president and general \nmanager. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that only the drug dealer, whether \ncorporation or individual, was subject to the criminal provisions of the Act, and that where the dealer was \na corporation, an individual connected therewith might be held personally only if he was operating the \ncorporation as his ‘alter ego.’ \n \nIn reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstating Dotterweich’s conviction, this Court \nlooked to the purposes of the Act and noted that they “touch phases of the lives and health of people \nwhich, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. It observed that \nthe Act is of “a now familiar type” which “dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal \nconduct-awareness of some wrongdoing: In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at \nhazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.

            "chunk": "means straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting \nsomeone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet \nthe law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a \nremedy for \"defaming\" someone, orally or in writing, to others. \n \nAlthough the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines. More and \nmore people injured by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of remedy through the \ncourts). Headlines boast of multimillion-dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations, \nagainst newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against oil companies that devastate entire \necosystems. All are examples of tort suits. \n \nThe law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by \nlegislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the \ncommon law (judicial decisions). Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules \nthat govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other. Through \ncontracts, individuals can craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other. In the absence of \ncontracts, tort law holds individuals legally accountable for the consequences of their actions. Those who \nsuffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated. \n \nMany acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious. But torts and crimes are different, and the \ndifference is worth noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society punishes the murderer; \nit does not usually compensate the family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a \nprivate wrong for which damages are owed. In a civil case, the tort victim or his family, not the state, \nbrings the action. The judgment against a defendant in a civil tort suit is usually expressed in monetary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n283 \nterms, not in terms of prison times or fines, and is the legal system’s way of trying to make up for the \nvictim’s loss. \n \nKinds of Torts \nThere are three kinds of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts, and strict liability torts. Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions. One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than",

One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still another excuse is consent: two \nboxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear). \n \nDamages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n286 \nSince the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually \nmeasured by the extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the",

            "chunk": "someone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent \nfrom the target to the actual victim of the act. Thus Hermione could sue Draco for battery for any damages \nshe had suffered. \n \nFalse Imprisonment \nThe tort of false imprisonment originally implied a locking up, as in a prison, but today it can occur if a \nperson is restrained in a room or a car or even if his or her movements are restricted while walking down \nthe street. People have a right to be free to go as they please, and anyone who without cause deprives \nanother of personal freedom has committed a tort. Damages are allowed for time lost, discomfort and \nresulting ill health, mental suffering, humiliation, loss of reputation or business, and expenses such as \nattorneys’ fees incurred as a result of the restraint (such as a false arrest). But as the case of Lester v. \nAlbers Super Markets, Inc. (Section 7.5 \"Cases\") shows, the defendant must be shown to have restrained \nthe plaintiff in order for damages to be allowed. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n289 \n \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \nUntil recently, the common-law rule was that there could be no recovery for acts, even though \nintentionally undertaken, that caused purely mental or emotional distress. For a case to go to the jury, the \ncourts required that the mental distress result from some physical injury. In recent years, many courts \nhave overthrown the older rule and now recognize the so-called new tort. In an employment context, \nhowever, it is rare to find a case where a plaintiff is able to recover. The most difficult hurdle is proving \nthat the conduct was “extreme” or “outrageous.” \n \nIn an early California case, bill collectors came to the debtor’s home repeatedly and threatened the \ndebtor’s pregnant wife. Among other things, they claimed that the wife would have to deliver her child in \nprison. The wife miscarried and had emotional and physical complications. The court found that the \nbehavior of the collection company’s two agents was sufficiently outrageous to prove the tort of \nintentional infliction of emotional distress. In Roche v. Stern (New York), the famous cable television talk \nshow host Howard Stern had tastelessly discussed the remains of Deborah Roche, a topless dancer and \ncable access television host. [1] The remains had been brought to Stern’s show by a close friend of Roche, \nChaunce Hayden, and a number of crude comments by Stern and Hayden about the remains were \nvideotaped and broadcast on a national cable television station. Roche’s sister and brother sued Howard \nStern and Infinity broadcasting and were able to get past the defendant’s motion to dismiss to have a jury \nconsider their claim. \nA plaintiff’s burden in these cases is to show that the mental distress is severe. Many states require that \nthis distress must result in physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, ulcers, or, as in the case of the \npregnant wife, a miscarriage. Other states have not required physical symptoms, finding that shame, \nembarrassment, fear, and anger constitute severe mental distress. \n \nTrespass and Nuisance \nTrespass is intentionally going on land that belongs to someone else or putting something on someone \nelse’s property and refusing to remove it. This part of tort law shows how strongly the law values the rights \nof property owners. The right to enjoy your property without interference from others is also found in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n290 \ncommon law of nuisance. There are limits to property owners’ rights, however. In Katko v. Briney, for \nexample, the plaintiff was injured by a spring gun while trespassing on the defendant’s property. [2] The \ndefendant had set up No Trespassing signs after ten years of trespassing and housebreaking events, with \nthe loss of some household items. Windows had been broken, and there was “messing up of the property \nin general.” The defendants had boarded up the windows and doors in order to stop the intrusions and \nfinally had set up a shotgun trap in the north bedroom of the house. One defendant had cleaned and oiled \nhis 20-gauge shotgun and taken it to the old house where it was secured to an iron bed with the barrel \npointed at the bedroom door. “It was rigged with wire from the doorknob to the gun’s trigger so would fire",

Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution \nMalicious prosecution is the tort of causing someone to be prosecuted for a criminal act, knowing that \nthere was no probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committed the crime. The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3] \n \nA statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A \nstatement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major \nnetwork weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show \nthat the words were aimed at them. But statements about large groups will not support an action for \ndefamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor). \nThe law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That a person did not intend to defame is \nordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, \nmagazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due care \nis usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel \ncannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else. Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel. In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement. It may be difficult to \nestablish damages, however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the \nslander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment. The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any \nstatements made in connection with legislative business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third \nperson, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the \nwarning, even though false. Likewise, an employee may warn an employer about the conduct or character \nof a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence \nor conduct of a child’s teacher. There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant with nothing but an \nidle interest in the matter (an “officious intermeddler”) must take the risk that his information is wrong. \n \nIn 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding \nthat under the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public official against a newspaper cannot \nstand unless the plaintiff has shown “actual malice,” which in turn was defined as “knowledge that [the \nstatement] was false or with a reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”[4] In subsequent cases, the \ncourt extended the constitutional doctrine further, applying it not merely to government officials but \nto public figures, people who voluntarily place themselves in the public eye or who involuntarily find \nthemselves the objects of public scrutiny. Whether a private person is or is not a public figure is a difficult \nquestion that has so far eluded rigorous definition and has been answered only from case to case. A CEO \nof a private corporation ordinarily will be considered a private figure unless he puts himself in the public \neye—for example, by starring in the company’s television commercials. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n295 \n \nInvasion of Privacy \nThe right of privacy—the right “to be let alone”—did not receive judicial recognition until the twentieth \ncentury, and its legal formulation is still evolving. In fact there is no single right of privacy. Courts and \ncommentators have discerned at least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control the \nappropriation of your name and picture for commercial purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on \nyour “personal space” or seclusion, (3) freedom from public disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts \nof your personal life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a “false light.” \n \nAppropriation of Name or Likeness \nThe earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was appropriation of name or likeness: someone else \nplacing your photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using your name as endorsing a \nproduct or in the product name. A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or \npicture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first \nobtaining written consent. The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country.

But \na person who is in the public eye cannot claim the same protection. \n \nFalse Light \nA final type of privacy invasion is that which paints a false picture in a publication. Though false, it might \nnot be libelous, since the publication need contain nothing injurious to reputation. Indeed, the publication \nmight even glorify the plaintiff, making him seem more heroic than he actually is. Subject to the First \nAmendment requirement that the plaintiff must show intent or extreme recklessness, statements that put \na person in a false light, like a fictionalized biography, are actionable. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are many kinds of intentional torts. Some of them involve harm to the physical person or to his or her \nproperty, reputation or feelings, or economic interests. In each case of intentional tort, the plaintiff must \nshow that the defendant intended harm, but the intent to harm does not need to be directed at a particular \nperson and need not be malicious, as long as the resulting harm is a direct consequence of the defendant’s \nactions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

            "chunk": "drowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase. For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold. \nThis limitation was known as the rule of privity. And users who were not immediate purchasers were said \nnot to be in privity with a supplier or manufacturer. In 1916, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, then on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n300 \nNew York Court of Appeals, penned an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of privity, \nthough it would take half a century before the last state—Mississippi in 1966—would fall in line. \nDetermining a duty of care can be a vexing problem. Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of \nmedical ethics to respect the confidences of their patients. Suppose a patient tells a psychiatrist that he \nintends to kill his girlfriend. Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn prospective victim? \nThe California Supreme Court has said yes. [1] \n \nEstablishing a breach of the duty of due care where the defendant has violated a statute or municipal \nordinance is eased considerably with the doctrine of negligence per se, a doctrine common to all US \nstate courts. If a legislative body sets a minimum standard of care for particular kinds of acts to protect a \ncertain set of people from harm and a violation of that standard causes harm to someone in that set, the \ndefendant is negligent per se. If Harvey is driving sixty-five miles per hour in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour \nzone when he crashes into Haley’s car and the police accident report establishes that or he otherwise \nadmits to going ten miles per hour over the speed limit, Haley does not have to prove that Harvey has \nbreached a duty of due care. She will only have to prove that the speeding was an actual and proximate \ncause of the collision and will also have to prove the extent of the resulting damages to her. \n \nCausation: Actual Cause and Proximate Cause \n“For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost,” as the old saying has it. Virtually any cause of an injury can be \ntraced to some preceding cause. The problem for the law is to know when to draw the line between causes \nthat are immediate and causes too remote for liability reasonably to be assigned to them. In tort theory, \nthere are two kinds of causes that a plaintiff must prove: actual cause and proximate \ncause. Actual cause (causation in fact) can be found if the connection between the defendant’s act \nand the plaintiff’s injuries passes the “but for” test: if an injury would not have occurred “but for” the \ndefendant’s conduct, then the defendant is the cause of the injury. Still, this is not enough causation to \ncreate liability. The injuries to the plaintiff must also be foreseeable, or not “too remote,” for the \ndefendant’s act to create liability. This is proximate cause: a cause that is not too remote or \nunforseeable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n301 \nSuppose that the person who was injured was not one whom a reasonable person could have expected to \nbe harmed. Such a situation was presented in one of the most famous US tort cases, Palsgraf v. Long \nIsland Railroad (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"), which was decided by Judge Benjamin Cardozo. Although Judge \nCardozo persuaded four of his seven brethren to side with his position, the closeness of the case \ndemonstrates the difficulty that unforeseeable consequences and unforeseeable plaintiffs present. \n \nDamages \nFor a plaintiff to win a tort case, she must allege and prove that she was injured. The fear that she might \nbe injured in the future is not a sufficient basis for a suit. This rule has proved troublesome in medical \nmalpractice and industrial disease cases. A doctor’s negligent act or a company’s negligent exposure of a \nworker to some form of contamination might not become manifest in the body for years. In the meantime, \nthe tort statute of limitations might have run out, barring the victim from suing at all. An increasing \nnumber of courts have eased the plaintiff’s predicament by ruling that the statute of limitations does not \nbegin to run until the victim discovers that she has been injured or contracted a disease. \n \nThe law allows an exception to the general rule that damages must be shown when the plaintiff stands in \ndanger of immediate injury from a hazardous activity. If you discover your neighbor experimenting with \nexplosives in his basement, you could bring suit to enjoin him from further experimentation, even though \nhe has not yet blown up his house—and yours.",

Factual \nissues are for the jury to resolve. Since it is frequently difficult to make out the requisite proof, the law \nallows certain presumptions and rules of evidence that ease the plaintiff’s task, on the ground that without \nthem substantial injustice would be done. One important rule goes by the Latin \nphrase res ipsa loquitur, meaning “the thing speaks for itself.” The best evidence is always the most \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n302 \ndirect evidence: an eyewitness account of the acts in question. But eyewitnesses are often unavailable, and \nin any event they frequently cannot testify directly to the reasonableness of someone’s conduct, which \ninevitably can only be inferred from the circumstances. \n \nIn many cases, therefore, circumstantial evidence (evidence that is indirect) will be the only evidence \nor will constitute the bulk of the evidence. Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no \none saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly \nconclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference \nof negligence. A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of \nnegligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, \nand the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the \nmanagement use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the \ndefendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] \n \nIf a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane \ncrashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the \ndefendants, that there was negligence. The plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining \nprecisely how the accident occurred. A defendant can always offer evidence that he acted reasonably—for \nexample, that the flour barrel was securely fastened and that a bolt of lightning, for which he was not \nresponsible, broke its bands, causing it to roll out the window. But testimony by the factory employees \nthat they secured the barrel, in the absence of any further explanation, will not usually serve to rebut the \ninference. That the defendant was negligent does not conclude the inquiry or automatically entitle the \nplaintiff to a judgment. Tort law provides the defendant with several excuses, some of which are discussed \nbriefly in the next section. \nExcuses \nThere are more excuses (defenses) than are listed here, but contributory negligence or comparative \nnegligence, assumption of risk, and act of God are among the principal defenses that will completely or \npartially excuse the negligence of the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n303 \nContributory and Comparative Negligence \nUnder an old common-law rule, it was a complete defense to show that the plaintiff in a negligence suit \nwas himself negligent. Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most of the fault being chargeable to \nthe defendant, the court would dismiss the suit if the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to his injury. In a few \nstates today, this rule of contributory negligence is still in effect. Although referred to as negligence, \nthe rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which the defendant is charged, because the \nplaintiff’s only error in such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have been, whereas the \ndefendant is charged with conduct careless toward others. This rule was so manifestly unjust in many \ncases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version \nof comparative negligence. Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned \naccording to the defendant’s degree of culpability. For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages.",

The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she \nmust suffer the consequences. \n \nThe assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways. The plaintiff may have formally agreed with the \ndefendant before entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of liability should injury \noccur. (“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I \nhaven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the \ndefendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is \nhit by a line drive in a ballpark). Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known in advance \nto have been created by the defendant’s negligence (failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do \nso, such as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be drunk). \n \nThe difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing line between subjectivity and objectivity. If the \nplaintiff had no actual knowledge of the risk, he cannot be held to have assumed it. On the other hand, it is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n304 \neasy to claim that you did not appreciate the danger, and the courts will apply an objective standard of \ncommunity knowledge (a “but you should have known” test) in many situations. When the plaintiff has no \nreal alternative, however, assumption of risk fails as a defense (e.g., a landlord who negligently fails to \nlight the exit to the street cannot claim that his tenants assumed the risk of using it). \n \nAt the turn of the century, courts applied assumption of risk in industrial cases to bar relief to workers \ninjured on the job. They were said to assume the risk of dangerous conditions or equipment. This rule has \nbeen abolished by workers’ compensation statutes in most states. \n \nAct of God \nTechnically, the rule that no one is responsible for an “act of God,” or force majeure as it is sometimes \ncalled, is not an excuse but a defense premised on a lack of causation. If a force of nature caused the harm, \nthen the defendant was not negligent in the first place. A marina, obligated to look after boats moored at \nits dock, is not liable if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was possible destroys \nsomeone’s vessel. However, if it is foreseeable that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by \na natural event, then there is liability. For example, a work crew failed to remove residue explosive gas \nfrom an oil barge. Lightning hit the barge, exploded the gas, and injured several workmen. The plaintiff \nrecovered damages against the company because the negligence consisted in the failure to guard against \nany one of a number of chance occurrences that could ignite the gas. [3] \n \nVicarious Liability \nLiability for negligent acts does not always end with the one who was negligent. Under certain \ncircumstances, the liability is imputed to others. For example, an employer is responsible for the \nnegligence of his employees if they were acting in the scope of employment. This rule of vicarious liability \nis often called respondeat superior, meaning that the higher authority must respond to claims brought \nagainst one of its agents. Respondeat superior is not limited to the employment relationship but extends \nto a number of other agency relationships as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n305 \nLegislatures in many states have enacted laws that make people vicariously liable for acts of certain people \nwith whom they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency. It is common, for example, for \nthe owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car. So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others. In these situations, although the injurious \nact of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) \nis not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now",

In each negligence claim, the \nplaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the defendant had a duty of due care, (2) \nthe defendant breached that duty, (3) that the breach of duty both actually and approximately has caused \nharm to the plaintiff, and (4) that the harm is measurable in money damages. \nIt is also possible for the negligence of one person to be imputed to another, as in the case of respondeat \nsuperior, or in the case of someone who loans his automobile to another driver who is negligent and causes \ninjury.

Understand the historical origins of strict liability under common law. \n3. Be able to apply strict liability concepts to liability for defective products. \n4. Distinguish strict liability from absolute liability, and understand the major defenses to a lawsuit in \nproducts-liability cases. \n \n \n \nHistorical Basis of Strict Liability: Animals and Ultrahazardous Activities \nTo this point, we have considered principles of liability that in some sense depend upon the “fault” of the \ntortfeasor. This fault is not synonymous with moral blame. \n \nAside from acts intended to harm, the fault lies in a failure to live up to a standard of reasonableness or \ndue care. But this is not the only basis for tort liability. Innocent mistakes can be a sufficient basis. As we \nhave already seen, someone who unknowingly trespasses on another’s property is liable for the damage \nthat he does, even if he has a reasonable belief that the land is his. And it has long been held that someone \nwho engages in ultrahazardous (or sometimes, abnormally dangerous) activities is liable for damage that \nhe causes, even though he has taken every possible precaution to avoid harm to someone else. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n307 \n \nLikewise, the owner of animals that escape from their pastures or homes and damage neighboring \nproperty may be liable, even if the reason for their escape was beyond the power of the owner to stop (e.g., \na fire started by lightning that burns open a barn door). In such cases, the courts invoke the principle of \nstrict liability, or, as it is sometimes called, liability without fault. The reason for the rule is explained \nin Klein v. Pyrodyne Corporation (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"). \n \nStrict Liability for Products \nProducts liability is extremely important. Strict liability may also apply as a legal standard for products, \neven those that are not ultrahazardous. In some national legal systems, strict liability is not available as a \ncause of action to plaintiffs seeking to recover a judgment of products liability against a manufacturer, \nwholesaler, distributor, or retailer.

The argument in essence is that a duty should spring from the University’s natural interest \nin the welfare and safety of its students, its superior knowledge of the nature and degree of risk involved \nin trampoline use, and its knowledge of the use of trampolines on the University campus. The evidence \namply supports a conclusion that trampoline use involves risks of serious injuries and that the potential \nfor an injury such as that experienced by Whitlock was foreseeable. It shows further that prior injuries \nresulting from trampoline accidents had been reported to campus security and to the student clinic, and \nthat University administrators were aware of the number and severity of trampoline injuries nationwide. \n \nThe record, however, also establishes through Whitlock’s own testimony that he was aware of the risk of \nan accident and injury of the very nature that he experienced.… \n \nWe conclude that the relationship between the University and Whitlock was not one of dependence with \nrespect to the activities at issue here, and provides no basis for the recognition of a duty of the University \nto take measures for protection of Whitlock against the injury that he suffered. \n \nB. \nWe next examine the lease between the University and the fraternity to determine whether a special \nrelationship between the University and Whitlock can be predicated on that document. The lease was \nexecuted in 1929, extends for a ninety-nine year term, and gives the fraternity the option to extend the \nterm for another ninety-nine years. The premises are to be occupied and used by the fraternity “as a \nfraternity house, clubhouse, dormitory and boarding house, and generally for religious, educational, social \nand fraternal purposes.” Such occupation is to be “under control of the tenant.” (emphasis added) The \nannual rental at all times relevant to this case appears from the record to be one dollar. The University has \nthe obligation to maintain the grounds and make necessary repairs to the building, and the fraternity is to \nbear the cost of such maintenance and repair. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n319 \n \n… \n \nWe conclude that the lease, and the University’s actions pursuant to its rights under the lease, provide no \nbasis of dependence by the fraternity members upon which a special relationship can be found to exist \nbetween the University and the fraternity members that would give rise to a duty upon the University to \ntake affirmative action to assure that recreational equipment such as a trampoline is not used under \nunsafe conditions. \n \nIV. \nConsidering all of the factors presented, we are persuaded that under the facts of this case the University \nof Denver had no duty to Whitlock to eliminate the private use of trampolines on its campus or to \nsupervise that use. There exists no special relationship between the parties that justifies placing a duty \nupon the University to protect Whitlock from the well-known dangers of using a trampoline. Here, a \nconclusion that a special relationship existed between Whitlock and the University sufficient to warrant \nthe imposition of liability for nonfeasance would directly contravene the competing social policy of \nfostering an educational environment of student autonomy and independence. \n \nWe reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and return this case to that court with directions to \nremand it to the trial court for dismissal of Whitlock’s complaint against the University. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

The rocket exploded near a crowd of onlookers, including Danny Klein. Klein’s clothing was \nset on fire, and he suffered facial burns and serious injury to his eyes. Klein sued Pyrodyne for strict \nliability to recover for his injuries. Pyrodyne asserted that the Chinese manufacturer of the fireworks was \nnegligent in producing the rocket and therefore Pyrodyne should not be held liable. The trial court applied \nthe doctrine of strict liability and held in favor of Klein. Pyrodyne appealed. \n \nSection 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that any party carrying on an “abnormally \ndangerous activity” is strictly liable for ensuing damages. The public display of fireworks fits this \ndefinition. The court stated: “Any time a person ignites rockets with the intention of sending them aloft to \nexplode in the presence of large crowds of people, a high risk of serious personal injury or property \ndamage is created. That risk arises because of the possibility that a rocket will malfunction or be \nmisdirected.” Pyrodyne argued that its liability was cut off by the Chinese manufacturer’s negligence. The \ncourt rejected this argument, stating, “Even if negligence may properly be regarded as an intervening \ncause, it cannot function to relieve Pyrodyne from strict liability.” \n \nThe Washington Supreme Court held that the public display of fireworks is an abnormally dangerous \nactivity that warrants the imposition of strict liability. \n \nAffirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Tort law has had a significant impact on business because modern \ntechnology poses significant dangers and the modern market is so efficient at distributing goods to a wide \nclass of consumers. \n \nUnlike criminal law, tort law does not require the tortfeasor to have a specific intent to commit the act for \nwhich he or she will be held liable to pay damages. Negligence—that is, carelessness—is a major factor in \ntort liability. In some instances, especially in cases involving injuries caused by products, a no-fault \nstandard called strict liability is applied. \n \nWhat constitutes a legal injury depends very much on the circumstances. A person can assume a risk or \nconsent to the particular action, thus relieving the person doing the injury from tort liability. To be liable, \nthe tortfeasor must be the proximate cause of the injury, not a remote cause. On the other hand, certain \npeople are held to answer for the torts of another—for example, an employer is usually liable for the torts \nof his employees, and a bartender might be liable for injuries caused by someone to whom he sold too \nmany drinks. Two types of statutes—workers’ compensation and no-fault automobile insurance—have \neliminated tort liability for certain kinds of accidents and replaced it with an immediate insurance \npayment plan. \n \nAmong the torts of particular importance to the business community are wrongful death and personal \ninjury caused by products or acts of employees, misrepresentation, defamation, and interference with \ncontractual relations. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n325 \n1.

An employee put the woman in an infirmary but provided no medical care for six \nhours, and she died. The woman’s family sued the store for wrongful death.

Although the railroad company was notified of the problem \na month earlier, the railroad inspector has failed to come by and repair them. Seeing the all-clear signal, a \ncar drives up and stalls on the tracks as a train rounds the bend. For the past two weeks the car had been \nstalling, and the driver kept putting off taking the car to the shop for a tune-up. As the train rounds the \nbend, the engineer is distracted by a conductor and does not see the car until it is too late to stop. Who is \nnegligent? Who must bear the liability for the damage to the car and to the train? \n4. Suppose in the Katko v. Briney case (Section 7.2 \"Intentional Torts\") that instead of setting such a device, \nthe defendants had simply let the floor immediately inside the front door rot until it was so weak that \nanybody who came in and took two steps straight ahead would fall through the floor and to the cellar. Will \nthe defendant be liable in this case? What if they invited a realtor to appraise the place and did not warn \nher of the floor? Does it matter whether the injured person is a trespasser or an invitee? \n5. Plaintiff’s husband died in an accident, leaving her with several children and no money except a valid \ninsurance policy by which she was entitled to $5,000. Insurance Company refused to pay, delaying and \nrefusing payment and meanwhile “inviting” Plaintiff to accept less than $5,000, hinting that it had a \ndefense.

            "chunk": "our notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a \nnineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law. As he \nput it: \n \n(F)rom a condition of society in which all the relations of Persons are summed up in the relations \nof Family, we seem to have steadily moved towards a phase of social order in which all these \nrelations arise from the free agreement of Individuals. . . . Thus the status of the Slave has \ndisappeared—it has been superseded by the contractual relation of the servant to his master. . . . \nThe status of the Female under Tutelage . . . has also ceased to exist. . . . So too the status of the \nSon under Power has no true place in the law of modern European societies. If any civil \nobligation binds together the Parent and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives \nits legal validity.... If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to \nsignify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we \nmay say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from \nStatus to Contract. [1] \n \nThis movement was not accidental. It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the \nfifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy \nwith all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, \ncommercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n330 \nContract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan. It was a response to \nchanging conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted, preferring the quieter, imagined \npastoral life of their forefathers. Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, \ndid a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with modem capitalism. \n \nContract Defined \nAs usual in the law, the legal definition of “contract” is formalistic. The Restatement says: “A contract is \na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which \nthe law in some way recognizes as a duty.” (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 1) Similarly, the \nUniform Commercial Code says: “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the \nparties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.” (Section 1-201(11)) A \nshort-hand definition is: “A contract is a legally enforceable promise.” \n \nEconomic View of Contract Law \nIn An Economic Analysis of Law (1973), Judge Richard A. Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves.

By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law. One of its first projects, and ultimately one of its most \nsuccessful, was the drafting of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts, completed in 1932. A \nrevision—the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979. \nThe Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, \nrestitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field. These analyses are \nmade with an eye to discerning the various principles that have emerged from the courts, and to the \nmaximum extent possible, the Restatements declare the law as the courts have determined it to be. The \nRestatements, guided by a Reporter (the director of the project) and a staff of legal scholars, go through \nseveral so-called “tentative” drafts—sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty—and are screened by various \ncommittees within the American Law Institute before they are eventually published as final documents. \n \nThe Restatement of Contracts won prompt respect in the courts and has been cited in innumerable cases. \nThe Restatements are not authoritative, in the sense that they are not actual judicial precedents, but they \nare nevertheless weighty interpretive texts, and judges frequently look to them for guidance. They are as \nclose to “black letter” rules of law as exist anywhere in the American legal system for judge-made \n(common) law. \n \nStatutory Law: The Uniform Commercial Code \nCommon law contract principles govern contracts for real estate and for services, obviously very \nimportant areas of law. But in one area the common law has been superseded by an important statute: the \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC), especially Article 2, which deals with the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n332 \nA Brief History \nThe UCC is a model law developed by the American law Institute and the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws; it has been adopted in one form or another in all fifty states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the American territories. It is the only “national” law not enacted by Congress. \n \nBefore the UCC was written, commercial law varied, sometimes greatly, from state to state. This first \nproved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to business as the American economy became \nnationwide during the twentieth century. Although there had been some uniform laws concerned with \ncommercial deals—including the Uniform Sales Act, first published in 1906—few were widely adopted and \nnone nationally. As a result, the law governing sales of goods, negotiable instruments, warehouse receipts, \nsecurities, and other matters crucial to doing business in an industrial, market economy was a crazy quilt \nof untidy provisions that did not mesh well from state to state. \n \nInitial drafting of the UCC began in 1942 and was ten years in the making, involving the efforts of \nhundreds of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and judges. A final draft, promulgated by the Institute and \nthe Conference, was endorsed by the American Bar Association and published in 1951. \n \nPennsylvania enacted the code in its entirety in 1953. It was the only state to enact the original version, \nbecause the Law Revision Commission of the New York State legislature began to examine it line by line \nand had serious objections. Three years later, in 1956, a revised code was issued. This version, known as \nthe 1957 Official Text, was enacted in Massachusetts and Kentucky. In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform. Responding to this development the American Law Institute \nestablished a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code. Various subcommittees \nwent to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published. Twelve more states adopted",

Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement. For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car. Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you.",

Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing. For example, Tom \nowes Pete money, but Pete has waited too long to collect it and the statute of limitations has run out. The \ncontract for repayment is unenforceable and Pete is out of luck, unless Tom makes a new promise to pay \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n339 \nor actually pays part of the debt. (However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n340 \n1.

Learn when a contract must be in writing—or evidenced by some writing—to be enforceable. \n \n \nAlthough it has countless wrinkles and nuances, contract law asks two principal questions: did the parties \ncreate a valid, enforceable contract? What remedies are available when one party breaks the contract? The \nanswer to the first question is not always obvious; the range of factors that must be taken into account can \nbe large and their relationship subtle. Since people in business frequently conduct contract negotiations \nwithout the assistance of a lawyer, it is important to attend to the nuances to avoid legal trouble at the \noutset.

            "chunk": "communicated and must be definite; that is, they must spell out terms to which the offeree can assent. \n \nTo constitute an agreement, there must be an acceptance of the offer. The offeree must manifest his \nassent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer. Complications arise when an \noffer is accepted indirectly through correspondence. Although offers and revocations of offers are not \neffective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner \nspecified by the offeror. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n343 \n \nIf the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the \nofferee uses a reasonable method of acceptance. It is implied that the offeree can use the same means used \nby the offeror or a means of communication customary to the industry. For example, the use of the postal \nservice was so customary that acceptances are considered effective when mailed, regardless of the method \nused to transmit the offer. Indeed, the so-called “mailbox rule” (the acceptance is effective upon dispatch) \nhas an ancient lineage, tracing back nearly two hundred years to the English courts. [2] \nConsideration \nConsideration, is the quid pro quo (something given or received for something else) between the \ncontracting parties in the absence of which the law will not enforce the promise or promises made. \nConsider the following three “contracts”: \n \n1. Betty offers to give a book to Lou. Lou accepts. \n2. Betty offers Lou the book in exchange for Lou’s promise to pay $15. Lou accepts. \n3. Betty offers to give Lou the book if Lou promises to pick it up at Betty’s house. Lou accepts. \n \nThe question is which, if any, is a binding contract? In American law, only situation 2 is a binding \ncontract, because only that contract contains a set of mutual promises in which each party pledges to give \nup something to the benefit of the other. \n \nThe question of what constitutes a binding contract has been answered differently throughout history and \nin other cultures. For example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing was binding, \nwhether or not there was consideration in our sense. Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of \ngifts were made binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the United States. And in \nthe Anglo-American tradition, the presence of a seal was once sufficient to make a contract binding \nwithout any other consideration. In most states, the seal is no longer a substitute for consideration, \nalthough in some states it creates a presumption of consideration. The Uniform Commercial Code has \nabolished the seal on contracts for the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n344 \nThe existence of consideration is determined by examining whether the person against whom a promise is \nto be enforced (the promisor) received something in return from the person to whom he made the \npromise (the promisee). That may seem a simple enough question. But as with much in the law, the \ncomplicating situations are never very far away. The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor. Whether \nconsideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to \nmake the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment. (Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the \npromisor is sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did \nthe promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise? Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting. In the third example, \nwhat might appear to be such a promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou \ncome to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift. Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book.",

(In \nsome states, a court may ratify the contract before the child becomes an adult. In California, for example, \na state statute permits a movie producer to seek court approval of a contract with a child actor in order to \nprevent the child from disaffirming it upon reaching majority and suing for additional wages. As quid pro \nquo, the court can order the producer to pay a percentage of the wages into a trust fund that the child’s \nparents or guardians cannot invade.) If the child has not disaffirmed the contract while still a minor, she \nmay do so within a reasonable time after reaching majority. \n \nIn most cases of disavowal, the only obligation is to return the goods (if he still has them) or repay the \nconsideration (unless it has been dissipated). However, in two situations, a minor might incur greater \nliability: contracts for necessities and misrepresentation of age. \n \nContract for Necessities \nAt common law, a “necessity” was defined as an essential need of a human being: food, medicine, \nclothing, and shelter. In recent years, however, the courts have expanded the concept, so that in many \nstates today necessities include property and services that will enable the minor to earn a living and to \nprovide for those dependent on him. If the contract is executory, the minor can simply disaffirm. If the \ncontract has been executed, however, the minor must face more onerous consequences. Although he will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n347 \nnot be required to perform under the contract, he will be liable under a theory of “quasi-contract” for the \nreasonable value of the necessity. \n \nMisrepresentation of Age \nIn most states, a minor may misrepresent his age and disaffirm in accordance with the general rule, \nbecause that’s what kids do, misrepresent their age. That the adult reasonably believed the minor was also \nan adult is of no consequence in a contract suit. But some states have enacted statutes that make the \nminor liable in certain situations. A Michigan statute, for instance, prohibits a minor from disaffirming if \nhe has signed a “separate instrument containing only the statement of age, date of signing and the \nsignature:” And some states “estop” him from claiming to be a minor if he falsely represented himself as \nan adult in making the ·contract. “Estoppel” is a refusal by the courts on equitable grounds to listen to an \notherwise valid defense; unless the minor can return the consideration, the contract will be enforced. \n \nContracts made by an insane or intoxicated person are also said to have been made by a person lacking \ncapacity. In general, such contracts are voidable by the person when capacity is regained (or by the \nperson’s legal representative if capacity is not regained). \n \nForm \nAs a general rule, a contract need not be in writing to be enforceable. An oral agreement to pay a high-\nfashion model $1 million to pose for a photograph is as binding as if the language of the deal were printed \non vellum and signed in the presence of twenty bishops. For centuries, however, a large exception has \ngrown up around the Statute of Frauds, first enacted in England in 1677 under the formal name “An \nAct for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries.” The purpose of the Statute of Frauds is to prevent the \nfraud that occurs when one party attempts to impose upon another a contract that did not in fact exist. \nThe two sections dealing with contracts read as follows: \n[Sect. 4] ...no action shall be brought whereby to charge any executor or administrator upon any \nspecial promise, to answer damages out of his own estate; (2) or whereby to charge the \ndefendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another \nperson; (3) or to charge any person upon any agreement made upon consideration of marriage; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n348 \n(4) or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest in or \nconcerning them; (5) or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one \nyear from the making thereof; (6) unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, \nor some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged \ntherewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. \n \n[Sect. 17] ...no contract for the sale of any goods, wares and merchandizes, for the price of ten \npounds sterling or upwards, shall be allowed to be good, except the buyer shall accept part of the \ngoods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or \nin part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be made \nand signed by the parties to be charged by such contract, or their agents thereunto lawfully \nauthorized. \n \nAgain, as may be evident from the title of the act and its language, the general purpose of the law is to",

Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages. When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n352 \nprice as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in \nthe event of breach. \n \nIncidental Damages \nSuppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search. After one year the \nprofessor quits to take a job elsewhere, in breach of her contract. If City College has to pay $5000 more to \nfind a replacement for year, Blake is liable for that amount—that’s compensatory damages. But what if it \ncosts City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and interview a replacement? City College can \nclaim that, too, as incidental damages which include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching \nparty after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. \n \nPunitive Damages \nPunitive damages are those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a civil action, in \nwhich criminal sanctions may be unavailable. They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; \nthey are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to \ndeter others from acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, \npunitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is \nalso a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of \ntorts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, \ndeliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some \nkinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security \nunder a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor \nwas not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort of conversion. Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law.

Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are \ncharges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees. California has been the leader among \nthe state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints \nthat the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless \ncompanies. Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of \ncontract. \n \nSpecific Performance \nSpecific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which \nhe obligated himself in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be \nissued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is seeking \nenforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from \ndoing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate \nremedy.) Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental \nvalue because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while still \nexecutory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily. Specific \nperformance is an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach of contract to sell a unique \nitem (real estate is always unique). \n \nRestitution \nAs the word implies, restitution is a restoring to one party of what he gave to the other. Therefore, only \nto the extent that the injured party conferred a benefit on the other party may the injured party be \nawarded restitution. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n354 \nIf the claimant has given the other party a sum of money, there can be no dispute over the amount of the \nrestitution interest. Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom’s restitution \ninterest is $100. But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance. The courts \nhave considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the \ninjured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the \nproperty of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance. Mellors, a gardener, agrees to \nconstruct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500. After erecting \nthree, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased \nthe value of the Lady’s grounds by $800. If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s \nrestitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would \nhave cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends on who \nrepudiated the contract and for what reason. \n \nTort vs. Contract Remedies \nFrequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious conduct. A physician warrants her treatment as \nperfectly safe but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient for life. The patient could sue \nfor malpractice (tort) or for breach of warranty (contract). The choice involves at least four \nconsiderations: \n1. Statute of limitations. Most statutes of limitations prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort \nactions. \n2. Allowable damages. Punitive damages are more often permitted in tort actions, and certain kinds of \ninjuries are compensable in tort but not in contract suits—for example, pain and suffering. \n3. Expert testimony. In most cases, the use of experts would be the same in either tort or contract suits,",

[Citation] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n361 \n \nState Policemen Garret Godby, Johnny Simms and Tilford Reppert made the arrest of the bank robbers \nand captured the stolen money. All participated in the prosecution. At the time of the arrest, it was the \nduty of the state policemen to apprehend the criminals. Under the law they cannot claim or share in the \nreward and they are interposing no claim to it. \n \nThis leaves the defendant, Tilford Reppert the sole eligible claimant. The record shows that at the time of \nthe arrest he was a deputy sheriff in Rockcastle County, but the arrest and recovery of the stolen money \ntook place in Pulaski County. He was out of his jurisdiction, and was thus under no legal duty to make the \narrest, and is thus eligible to claim and receive the reward. In [Citation] it was said: \n‘It is * * * well established that a public officer with the authority of the law to make an arrest may accept \nan offer of reward or compensation for acts or services performed outside of his bailiwick or not within \nthe scope of his official duties. * * *.’… \n \nIt is manifest from the record that Tilford Reppert is the only claimant qualified and eligible to receive the \nreward. Therefore, it is the judgment of the circuit court that he is entitled to receive payment of the \n$1,500.00 reward now deposited with the Clerk of this Court. \n \nThe judgment is affirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

In 2000, the Ransoms decided to build a creamery on-site to \nprocess their milk and formed EBWS, LLC to operate the dairy-processing plant and to market the plant’s \nproducts. In July 2000, Earl Ransom, on behalf of EBWS, met with Britly’s president to discuss building \nthe creamery.…In January 2001, EBWS and Britly entered into a contract requiring Britly to construct a \ncreamery building for EBWS in exchange for $160,318.…The creamery was substantially completed by \nApril 15, 2001, and EBWS moved in soon afterward. On June 5, 2001, EBWS notified Britly of alleged \ndefects in construction. [EBWS continued to use the creamery pending the necessity to vacate it for three \nweeks when repairs were commenced]. \n \nOn September 12, 2001, EBWS filed suit against Britly for damages resulting from defective design and \nconstruction.… \n \nFollowing a three-day trial, the jury found Britly had breached the contract and its express warranty, and \nawarded EBWS: (1) $38,020 in direct damages, and (2) $35,711 in consequential damages.… \n \n…The jury’s award to EBWS included compensation for both direct and consequential damages that \nEBWS claimed it would incur while the facility closed for repairs. Direct damages [i.e., compensatory \ndamages] are for “losses that naturally and usually flow from the breach itself,” and it is not necessary that \nthe parties actually considered these damages. [Citation]. In comparison, special or consequential \ndamages “must pass the tests of causation, certainty and foreseeability, and, in addition, be reasonably \nsupposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract.” \n \n…The court ruled that EBWS could not recover for lost profits because it was not a going concern at the \ntime the contract was entered into, and profits were too speculative. The court concluded, however, that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n363 \nEBWS could submit evidence of other business losses, including future payment for unused milk and staff \nwages.… \n \nAt trial, Huyffer, the CEO of EBWS, testified that during a repairs closure the creamery would be required \nto purchase milk from adjacent Rock Bottom Farm, even though it could not process this milk. She \nadmitted that such a requirement was self-imposed as there was no written output contract between \nEBWS and the farm to buy milk. In addition, Huyffer testified that EBWS would pay its employees during \nthe closure even though EBWS has no written contract to pay its employees when they are not working. \nThe trial court allowed these elements of damages to be submitted to the jury, and the jury awarded \nEBWS consequential damages for unused milk and staff wages. \n \nOn appeal, Britly contends that because there is no contractual or legal obligation for EBWS to purchase \nmilk or pay its employees, these are not foreseeable damages.

Now, while you have income from doing clients’ taxes, I have an excellent offer for \nyou. You can buy a new Buick Century automobile completely loaded for $36,000. Al, I know you’re busy. If \nI don’t hear from you by the end of the day, I’ll assume you want the car.” Albert, distracted, did not \nrespond immediately, and the dealer hung up. Then followed an exhausting day of working with anxiety-\nridden tax clients. Albert forgot about the conversation. Two days later a statement arrived from the \ndealer, with instructions on how Albert should pick up the car at the dealership. Is there a contract? \nExplain. \n3. Bert purchased Ernie’s car. Before selling the car, Ernie had stated to Bert, “This car runs well and is \nreliable. Last week I drove the car all the way from Seattle to San Francisco to visit my mother and back \nagain to Seattle.” In fact, Ernie was not telling the truth: he had driven the car to San Francisco to visit his \nparamour, not his mother. Upon discovery of the truth, may Bert avoid the contract? Why? \n4. Langstraat was seventeen when he purchased a motorcycle.

Understand why agency law is important. \n2. Recognize the recurring legal issues in agency law. \n3. Know the types of agents. \n4. Understand how the agency relationship is created. \n \n \nIntroduction to Agency Law \nWhy Is Agency Law Important, and What Is an Agent? \nAn agent is a person who acts in the name of and on behalf of another, having been given and assumed \nsome degree of authority to do so. Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—\nis carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships \nand other business organizations rely extensively on agents to conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each \npartner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the \ncorporation. \n \nThe existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature. He is said to \nhave been the first person from the Mayflower to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620; he was a carpenter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n372 \na cooper (barrel maker), and a diplomat. His agency task—of interest here—was celebrated in Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow’s “The Courtship of Miles Standish.” He was to woo Priscilla Mullins (d. 1680), \n“the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,” on behalf of Captain Miles Standish, a valiant soldier who was too shy \nto propose marriage. Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady. But Alden was so tongue-tied that his vaunted eloquence fell short, turned Priscilla cold toward \nthe object of Alden’s mission, and eventually led her to turn the tables in one of the most famous lines in \nAmerican literature and poetry: “Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?” John eventually did: the two \nwere married in 1623 in Plymouth. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency \nLet’s analyze this sequence of events in legal terms—recognizing, of course, that this example is an \nanalogy and that the law, even today, would not impose consequences on Alden for his failure to carry out \nCaptain Standish’s wishes. Alden was the captain’s agent: he was specifically authorized to speak in his \nname in a manner agreed on, toward a specified end, and he accepted the assignment in consideration of \nthe captain’s friendship. He had, however, a conflict of interest. He attempted to carry out the assignment, \nbut he did not perform according to expectations. Eventually, he wound up with the prize himself. Here \nare some questions to consider, the same questions that will recur throughout the discussion of agency: \n \n• \nHow extensive was John’s authority? Could he have made promises to Priscilla on the captain’s \nbehalf—for example, that Standish would have built her a fine house? \n• \nCould he, if he committed a tort, have imposed liability on his principal? Suppose, for example, \nthat he had ridden at breakneck speed to reach Priscilla’s side and while en route ran into and \ninjured a pedestrian on the road. Could the pedestrian have sued Standish? \n• \nSuppose Alden had injured himself on the journey. Would Standish be liable to Alden? \n• \nIs Alden liable to Standish for stealing the heart of Priscilla—that is, for taking the “profits” of the \nenterprise for himself?",

These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant. Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v.

                    "answer": "It is important to understand the difference between an agent and an independent contractor because it has important legal consequences for taxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. An agent is someone who is employed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the performance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master. An independent contractor is a person who contracts with another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s right to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking."

Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from \ncoverage accidents involving employees of the insureds. General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. \nPro Golf Association [3] involved such a situation. The insurance policy in question covered members of \nthe Professional Golfers Association. Gerald Hall, a golf pro employed by the local park department, was \nafforded coverage under the policy, which excluded “bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising \nout of and in the course of his employment by the insured.” That is, no employee of Hall’s would be \ncovered (rather, any such person would have coverage under workers’ compensation statutes). Bradley \nMartin, age thirteen, was at the golf course for junior league play. At Hall’s request, he agreed to retrieve \nor “shag” golf balls to be hit during a lesson Hall was giving; he was—as Hall put it—to be compensated \n“either through golf instructions or money or hotdogs or whatever.” During the course of the lesson, a golf \nball hit by Hall hit young Martin in the eye. If Martin was an employee, the insurance company would be \nliable; if he was not an employee, the insurance company would not liable. The trial court determined he \nwas not an employee. The evidence showed: sometimes the boys who “shagged” balls got paid, got golfing \ninstructions, or got food, so the question of compensation was ambiguous. Martin was not directed in how \nto perform (the admittedly simple) task of retrieving golf balls, no control was exercised over him, and no \nequipment was required other than a bag to collect the balls: “We believe the evidence is susceptible of \ndifferent inferences.…We cannot say that the decision of the trial court is against the manifest weight of \nthe evidence.” \n \nCreation of the Agency Relationship \nThe agency relationship can be created in two ways: by agreement (expressly) or by operation of law \n(constructively or impliedly). \n \n \nAgency Created by Agreement \nMost agencies are created by contract. Thus the general rules of contract law covered in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" govern the law of agency. But agencies can also be created without contract, by agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n379 \nTherefore, three contract principles are especially important: the first is the requirement for \nconsideration, the second for a writing, and the third concerns contractual capacity. \n \nConsideration \nAgencies created by consent—agreement—are not necessarily contractual. It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent. There are, however, a few situations in which",

But there are some jobs on which the personal habits \nof the agent may have an effect. The agent is not at liberty to act with impropriety or notoriety, so as to \nbring disrepute on the business in which the principal is engaged. A lecturer at an antialcohol clinic may \nbe directed to refrain from frequenting bars. A bank cashier who becomes known as a gambler may be \nfired. \n \nDuty to Keep and Render Accounts \nThe agent must keep accurate financial records, take receipts, and otherwise act in conformity to standard \nbusiness practices. \n \nDuty to Act Only as Authorized \nThis duty states a truism but is one for which there are limits. A principal’s wishes may have been stated \nambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts \nreasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately \nrepudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to \nhim, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to \nliability to the principal.”[3] \n \nDuty Not to Attempt the Impossible or Impracticable \nThe principal says to the agent, “Keep working until the job is done.” The agent is not obligated to go \nwithout food or sleep because the principal misapprehended how long it would take to complete the job. \nNor should the agent continue to expend the principal’s funds in a quixotic attempt to gain business, sign \nup customers, or produce inventory when it is reasonably clear that such efforts would be in vain. \n \nDuty to Obey \nAs a general rule, the agent must obey reasonable directions concerning the manner of performance. \nWhat is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n385 \nprincipal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency. A principal may prescribe uniforms for \nvarious classes of employees, for instance, and a manufacturing company may tell its sales force what \nsales pitch to use on customers. On the other hand, certain tasks entrusted to agents are not subject to the \nprincipal’s control; for example, a lawyer may refuse to permit a client to dictate courtroom tactics. \n \nDuty to Give Information \nBecause the principal cannot be every place at once—that is why agents are hired, after all—much that is \nvital to the principal’s business first comes to the attention of agents. If the agent has actual notice or \nreason to know of information that is relevant to matters entrusted to him, he has a duty to inform the \nprincipal. This duty is especially critical because information in the hands of an agent is, under most \ncircumstances, imputed to the principal, whose legal liabilities to third persons may hinge on receiving \ninformation in timely fashion. Service of process, for example, requires a defendant to answer within a \ncertain number of days; an agent’s failure to communicate to the principal that a summons has been \nserved may bar the principal’s right to defend a lawsuit. The imputation to the principal of knowledge \npossessed by the agent is strict: even where the agent is acting adversely to the principal’s interests—for \nexample, by trying to defraud his employer—a third party may still rely on notification to the agent, unless \nthe third party knows the agent is acting adversely. \n \n“Shop Rights” Doctrine \nIn Grip Nut Co. v. Sharp, Sharp made a deal with Grip Nut Company that in return for a salary and \nbonuses as company president, he would assign to the company any inventions he made. [4] When the five-\nyear employment contract expired, Sharp continued to serve as chief executive officer, but no new \ncontract was negotiated concerning either pay or rights to inventions. During the next ten years, Sharp \ninvented a number of new products and developed new machinery to manufacture them; patent rights \nwent to the company. However, he made one invention with two other employees and they assigned the \npatent to him. A third employee invented a safety device and also assigned the patent to Sharp. At one \ntime, Sharp’s son invented a leakproof bolt and a process to manufacture it; these, too, were assigned to \nSharp. These inventions were developed in the company’s plants at its expense. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n386 \nWhen Sharp died, his family claimed the rights to the inventions on which Sharp held assignments and \nsued the company, which used the inventions, for patent infringement. The family reasoned that after the \nexpiration of the employment contract, Sharp was employed only in a managerial capacity, not as an \ninventor. The court disagreed and invoked the shop rights doctrine, under which an invention \n“developed and perfected in [a company’s] plant with its time, materials, and appliances, and wholly at its",

Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his \nagent. \n \nGeneral Contract Duties \nThese duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal \nhas a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” [5] The principal is allowed, \nhowever, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty \nto inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of \nassigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may \nbe dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject \nthe principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n387 \nprincipal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends \non a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, \nand the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, \nand so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it. \n \nEmployment at Will \nUnder the traditional “employment-at-will” doctrine, an employee who is not hired for a specific period \ncan be fired at any time, for any reason (except bad reasons: an employee cannot be fired, for example, for \nreporting that his employer’s paper mill is illegally polluting groundwater). This doctrine has been much \ncriticized. \n \nDuty to Indemnify \nAgents commonly spend money pursuing the principal’s business. Unless the agreement explicitly \nprovides otherwise, the principal has a duty to indemnify or reimburse the agent. A familiar form of \nindemnity is the employee expense account. \n \nTort and Workers’ Compensation Duties \nThe employer owes the employee—any employee, not just agents—certain statutorily imposed tort and \nworkers’ compensation duties. \n \nBackground to Workers’ Compensation \nAndy, who works in a dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong shed. Andy warns his \nfellow employee Bill that he has done so. Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands on \nthe ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At \ncommon law, the answer would be no—three times no. First, the “fellow-servant” rule would bar recovery \nbecause the employer was held not to be responsible for torts committed by one employee against \nanother. Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the dynamite had been negligently stored by the \nemployer rather than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been dismissed. Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

Union pressure and grass roots lobbying led to \nworkers’ compensation acts—statutory enactments that dramatically overhauled the law of torts as it \naffected employees. \n \n \nThe System in General \nWorkers’ compensation is a no-fault system. The employee gives up the right to sue the employer (and, in \nsome states, other employees) and receives in exchange predetermined compensation for a job-related \ninjury, regardless of who caused it. This trade-off was felt to be equitable to employer and employee: the \nemployee loses the right to seek damages for pain and suffering—which can be a sizable portion of any \njury award—but in return he can avoid the time-consuming and uncertain judicial process and assure \nhimself that his medical costs and a portion of his salary will be paid—and paid promptly. The employer \nmust pay for all injuries, even those for which he is blameless, but in return he avoids the risk of losing a \nbig lawsuit, can calculate his costs actuarially, and can spread the risks through insurance. \n \nMost workers’ compensation acts provide 100 percent of the cost of a worker’s hospitalization and \nmedical care necessary to cure the injury and relieve him from its effects. They also provide for payment \nof lost wages and death benefits. Even an employee who is able to work may be eligible to receive \ncompensation for specific injuries.

The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n• \nIs the injured person an employee? Courts are apt to be liberal in construing statutes to include \nthose who might not seem to be employed. InBetts v. Ann Arbor Public Schools, a University of \nMichigan student majoring in physical education was a student teacher in a junior high \nschool. [7] During a four-month period, he taught two physical education courses. On the last day \nof his student teaching, he walked into the locker room and thirty of his students grabbed him \nand tossed him into the swimming pool. This was traditional, but he “didn’t feel like going in that \nmorning” and put up a struggle that ended with a whistle on an elastic band hitting him in the \neye, which he subsequently lost as a result of the injury. He filed a workers’ compensation claim. \nThe school board argued that he could not be classified as an employee because he received no \npay. Since he was injured by students—not considered agents of the school—he would probably \nhave been unsuccessful in filing a tort suit; hence the workers’ compensation claim was his only \nchance of recompense. The state workers’ compensation appeal board ruled against the school on \nthe ground that payment in money was not required: “Plaintiff was paid in the form of training, \ncollege credits towards graduation, and meeting of the prerequisites of a state provisional \ncertificate.” The state supreme court affirmed the award. \n• \nHow palpable must the “injury” be? A difficult issue is whether a worker is entitled to \ncompensation for psychological injury, including cumulative trauma. Until the 1970s, insurance \ncompanies and compensation boards required physical injury before making an award. Claims \nthat job stresses led to nervous breakdowns or other mental disorders were rejected. But most \ncourts have liberalized the definition of injury and now recognize that psychological trauma can \nbe real and that job stress can bring it on, as shown by the discussion of Wolfe v. Sibley, Lindsay \n& Curr Co. in Section 9.3.4 \"Workers’ Compensation: What “Injuries” Are Compensable?\". \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n393 \nThe agent owes the principal two categories of duties: fiduciary and general. The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent?",

Ann Arbor Public Schools, a University of Michigan student majoring in physical education was a student teacher in a junior high school. [7] During a four-month period, he taught two physical education courses. On the last day of his student teaching, he walked into the locker room and thirty of his students grabbed him and tossed him into the swimming pool. This was traditional, but he “didn’t feel like going in that morning” and put up a struggle that ended with a whistle on an elastic band hitting him in the eye, which he subsequently lost as a result of the injury. He filed a workers’ compensation claim. The school board argued that he could not be classified as an employee because he received no pay. Since he was injured by students—not considered agents of the school—he would probably have been unsuccessful in filing a tort suit; hence the workers’ compensation claim was his only chance of recompense. The state workers’ compensation appeal board ruled against the school on the ground that payment in money was not required: “Plaintiff was paid in the form of training, college credits towards graduation, and meeting of the prerequisites of a state provisional certificate.” The state supreme court affirmed the award."

Microsoft agreed.… \n \nAfter learning of the IRS rulings, the plaintiffs sought various employee benefits, including those now at \nissue: the ESPP and SPP benefits. The SPP…is a cash or deferred salary arrangement under § 401k of the \nInternal Revenue Code that permits Microsoft’s employees to save and invest up to fifteen percent of their \nincome through tax-deferred payroll deductions.…Microsoft matches fifty percent of the employee’s \ncontribution in any year, with [a maximum matching contribution]. The ESPP…permits employees to \npurchase company stock [with various rules]. \n \nMicrosoft rejected the plaintiffs’ claims for benefits, maintaining that they were independent contractors \nwho were personally responsible for all their own benefits.… \n \nThe plaintiffs brought this action, challenging the denial of benefits. \n \nMicrosoft contends that the extrinsic evidence, including the [employment agreements], demonstrates its \nintent not to provide freelancers or independent contractors with employee benefits[.]…We have no doubt \nthat the company did not intend to provide freelancers or independent contractors with employee \nbenefits, and that if the plaintiffs had in fact been freelancers or independent contractors, they would not \nbe eligible under the plan. The plaintiffs, however, were not freelancers or independent contractors. They \nwere common-law employees, and the question is what, if anything, Microsoft intended with respect to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n401 \npersons who were actually common-law employees but were not known to Microsoft to be such. The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status. Indeed, Microsoft has pointed to no \nevidence suggesting that it ever denied eligibility to any employees, whom it understood to be common-\nlaw employees, by paying them through the accounts receivable department or otherwise. \n \nWe therefore construe the ambiguity in the plan against Microsoft and hold that the plaintiffs are eligible \nto participate under the terms of the SPP. \n \n[Next, regarding the ESPP] we hold that the plaintiffs…are covered by the specific provisions of the ESPP. \nWe apply the “objective manifestation theory of contracts,” which requires us to “impute an intention \ncorresponding to the reasonable meaning of a person’s words and acts.” [Citation] Through its \nincorporation of the tax code provision into the plan, Microsoft manifested an objective intent to make all \ncommon-law employees, and hence the plaintiffs, eligible for participation.

The \nclaimant, Mrs. Diana Wolfe, began her employment with the respondent department store, Sibley, \nLindsay & Curr Co. in February, 1968. After working for some time as an investigator in the security \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n408 \ndepartment of the store she became secretary to Mr. John Gorman, the security director. It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays. Mrs. Wolfe testified that throughout the several years she worked at Sibley’s Mr. \nGorman reacted to this holiday pressure by becoming extremely agitated and nervous. She noted, \nhowever, that this anxiety usually disappeared when the holiday season was over. Unfortunately, Mr. \nGorman’s nervous condition failed to abate after the 1970 holidays.… \nDespite the fact that he followed Mrs. Wolfe’s advice to see a doctor, Mr. Gorman’s mental condition \ncontinued to deteriorate. On one occasion he left work at her suggestion because he appeared to be so \nnervous. This condition persisted until the morning of June 9, 1971 when according to the claimant, Mr. \nGorman looked much better and even smiled and ‘tousled her hair’ when she so remarked. \n \nA short time later Mr. Gorman called her on the intercom and asked her to call the police to room 615. \nMrs. Wolfe complied with this request and then tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Gorman on the \nintercom. She entered his office to find him lying in a pool of blood caused by a self-inflicted gunshot \nwound in the head. Mrs. Wolfe became extremely upset and was unable to continue working that day. \n \nShe returned to work for one week only to lock herself in her office to avoid the questions of her fellow \nworkers. Her private physician perceiving that she was beset by feelings of guilt referred her to a \npsychiatrist and recommended that she leave work, which she did. While at home she ruminated about \nher guilt in failing to prevent the suicide and remained in bed for long periods of time staring at the \nceiling. The result was that she became unresponsive to her husband and suffered a weight loss of 20 \npounds. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Grinols diagnosed her condition as an acute depressive reaction. \n \nAfter attempting to treat her in his office Dr. Grinols realized that the severity of her depression mandated \nhospitalization. Accordingly, the claimant was admitted to the hospital on July 9, 1971 where she \nremained for two months during which time she received psychotherapy and medication. After she was \ndischarged, Dr. Grinols concluded that there had been no substantial remission in her depression and \nruminative guilt and so had her readmitted for electroshock treatment. These treatments lasted for three \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n409 \nweeks and were instrumental in her recovery. She was again discharged and, in mid-January, 1972, \nresumed her employment with Sibley, Lindsay & Curr. \nMrs. Wolfe’s claim for workmen’s compensation was granted by the referee and affirmed by the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Board. On appeal the Appellate Division reversed citing its opinions in \n[Citations], [concluding]…that mental injury precipitated solely by psychic trauma is not compensable as \na matter of law. We do not agree with this conclusion. \n \nWorkmen’s compensation, as distinguished from tort liability which is essentially based on fault, is \ndesigned to shift the risk of loss of earning capacity caused by industrial accidents from the worker to \nindustry and ultimately the consumer. In light of its beneficial and remedial character the Workmen’s \nCompensation Law should be construed liberally in favor of the employee [Citation]. \n \nLiability under the act is predicated on accidental injury arising out of and in the course of \nemployment.…Applying these concepts to the case at bar we note that there is no issue raised concerning \nthe causal relationship between the occurrence and the injury. The only testimony on this matter was \ngiven by Dr. Grinols who stated unequivocally that the discovery of her superior’s body was the competent \nproducing cause of her condition. Nor is there any question as to the absence of physical impact. \nAccordingly, the focus of our inquiry is whether or not there has been an accidental injury within the",

            "chunk": "9.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nAn agent is one who acts on behalf of another. The law recognizes several types of agents, including (1) the \ngeneral agent, one who possesses authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name of and \non behalf of the principal; (2) the special agent, one with authority to act only in a specifically designated \ninstance or set of transactions; (3) the agent whose agency is coupled with an interest, one who has a \nproperty interest in addition to authority to act as an agent; (4) the subagent, one appointed by an agent \nwith authority to do so; and (5) the servant (“employee” in modern English), one whose physical conduct \nis subject to control of the principal. \n \nA servant should be distinguished from an independent contractor, whose work is not subject to the \ncontrol of the principal. The difference is important for purposes of taxation, workers’ compensation, and \nliability insurance. \n \nThe agency relationship is usually created by contract, and sometimes governed by the Statute of Frauds, \nbut some agencies are created by operation of law. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n412 \nAn agent owes his principal the highest duty of loyalty, that of a fiduciary. The agent must avoid self-\ndealing, preserve confidential information, perform with skill and care, conduct his personal life so as not \nto bring disrepute on the business for which he acts as agent, keep and render accounts, and give \nappropriate information to the principal. \n \nAlthough the principal is not the agent’s fiduciary, the principal does have certain obligations toward the \nagent—for example, to refrain from interfering with the agent’s work and to indemnify. The employer’s \ncommon-law tort liability toward his employees has been replaced by the workers’ compensation system, \nunder which the employee gives up the right to sue for damages in return for prompt payment of medical \nand job-loss expenses. Injuries must have been work related and the injured person must have been an \nemployee. Courts today allow awards for psychological trauma in the absence of physical injury. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. A woman was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in the death of a passenger in her car. After \nshe was charged with manslaughter, her attorney agreed to work with her insurance company’s claims \nadjuster in handling the case. As a result of the agreement, the woman gave a statement about the \naccident to the claims adjuster. When the prosecuting attorney demanded to see the statement, the \nwoman’s attorney refused on the grounds that the claims adjuster was his—the attorney’s—agent, and \ntherefore the statement was covered by the attorney-client privilege. Is the attorney correct? Why? \n2. A local hotel operated under a franchise agreement with a major hotel chain. Several customers charged \nthe banquet director of the local hotel with misconduct and harassment. They sued the hotel chain (the \nfranchisor) for acts committed by the local hotel (the franchisee), claiming that the franchisee was the \nagent of the franchisor. Is an agency created under these circumstances? Why? \n3.

After she was charged with manslaughter, her attorney agreed to work with her insurance company’s claims adjuster in handling the case. As a result of the agreement, the woman gave a statement about the accident to the claims adjuster. When the prosecuting attorney demanded to see the statement, the woman’s attorney refused on the grounds that the claims adjuster was his—the attorney’s—agent, and therefore the statement was covered by the attorney-client privilege. Is the attorney correct? Why?",
                    "answer": "The attorney is incorrect.  The attorney-client privilege protects communications between an attorney and client.  However, the attorney's client is the woman, not the claims adjuster.  The woman is not the claims adjuster's client, so the claims adjuster is not the attorney's agent.  The attorney-client privilege does not apply to communications between the claims adjuster and the attorney.  Therefore, the attorney is not correct in refusing to turn over the statement to the prosecuting attorney."

Know that the principal may also be liable—even if the agent had no authority—if the principal ratifies the \nagent’s contract after the fact. \n \n \nPrincipal’s Contract Liability Requires That Agent Had Authority \nThe key to determining whether a principal is liable for contracts made by his agent is authority: was the \nagent authorized to negotiate the agreement and close the deal? Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority \nThe strongest form of authority is that which is expressly granted, often in written form. The principal \nconsents to the agent’s actions, and the third party may then rely on the document attesting to the agent’s \nauthority to deal on behalf of the principal. One common form of express authority is the standard \nsignature card on file with banks allowing corporate agents to write checks on the company’s credit. The \nprincipal bears the risk of any wrongful action of his agent, as demonstrated in Allen A. Funt Productions, \nInc. v. Chemical Bank. [1] Allen A. Funt submitted to his bank through his production company various \ncertificates permitting his accountant to use the company’s checking accounts. [2] In fact, for several years \nthe accountant embezzled money from the company by writing checks to himself and depositing them in \nhis own account. The company sued its bank, charging it with negligence, apparently for failing to monitor \nthe amount of money taken by the accountant. But the court dismissed the negligence complaint, citing a \nstate statute based on the common-law agency principle that a third party is entitled to rely on the express \nauthorization given to an agent; in this case, the accountant drew checks on the account within the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n418 \nmonetary limits contained in the signature cards on file with the bank. Letters of introduction and work \norders are other types of express authority. \n \nFigure 10.1 Types of Authority \n \n \nImplied Authority \nNot every detail of an agent’s work can be spelled out. It is impossible to delineate step-by-step the duties \nof a general agent; at best, a principal can set forth only the general nature of the duties that the agent is \nto perform. Even a special agent’s duties are difficult to describe in such detail as to leave him without \ndiscretion. If express authority were the only valid kind, there would be no efficient way to use an agent, \nboth because the effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the third party would be \nreluctant to deal with him. \nBut the law permits authority to be “implied” by the relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of \nthe business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question, the wording of the agency contract, and \nthe knowledge that the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it. In \neither event, the business manager has a relatively large domain of implied authority. He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business. The full extent of the manager’s authority \ndepends on the circumstances—what is customary in the particular industry, in the particular business, \nand among the individuals directly concerned. \n \nOn the other hand, a manager does not have implicit authority to undertake unusual or extraordinary \nactions on behalf of his principal. In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a",

Andy has no implied authority to change the name or to commission \nthe artist, though he does have implied authority to engage a printer to replenish the stationery supply—\nand possibly to make some design changes in the letterhead. \n \nEven when there is no implied authority, in an emergency the agent may act in ways that would in the \nnormal course require specific permission from the principal. If unforeseen circumstances arise and it is \nimpracticable to communicate with the principal to find out what his wishes would be, the agent may do \nwhat is reasonably necessary in order to prevent substantial loss to his principal. During World War II, \nEastern Wine Corporation marketed champagne in a bottle with a diagonal red stripe that infringed the \ntrademark of a French producer. The French company had granted licenses to an American importer to \nmarket its champagne in the United States. The contract between producer and importer required the \nlatter to notify the French company whenever a competitor appeared to be infringing its rights and to \nrecommend steps by which the company could stop the infringement. The authority to institute suit was \nnot expressly conferred, and ordinarily the right to do so would not be inferred. Because France was under \nGerman occupation, however, the importer was unable to communicate with the producer, its principal. \nThe court held that the importer could file suit to enjoin Eastern Wine from continuing to display the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n420 \ninfringing red diagonal stripe, since legal action was “essential to the preservation of the principal’s \nproperty.” [3] \n \nThe rule that a person’s position can carry with it implied authority is fundamental to American business \npractice. But outside the United States this rule is not applicable, and the business executive traveling \nabroad should be aware that in civil-law countries it is customary to present proof of authority to transact \ncorporate business—usually in the form of a power of attorney. This is not always an easy task. Not only \nmust the power of the traveling executive be shown but the right of the corporate officer back in the \nUnited States to delegate authority must also be proven. \n \nApparent Authority \nIn the agency relationship, the agent’s actions in dealing with third parties will affect the legal rights of the \nprincipal. What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel. Estoppel is the doctrine \nthat a person will not now be allowed to deny a promise or assertion she previously made where there has \nbeen detrimental reliance on that promise or assertion.

On September 3, Central received a letter from \nMeggs notifying it of Meggs’s sale of the business to Buyer.

Hancock Bank & Trust Company in Section 10.4.1 \"Implied Authority\". \n \nRatification \nEven if the agent possessed no actual authority and there was no apparent authority on which the third \nperson could rely, the principal may still be liable if he ratifies or adopts the agent’s acts before the third \nperson withdraws from the contract. Ratification usually relates back to the time of the undertaking, \ncreating authority after the fact as though it had been established initially. Ratification is a voluntary act \nby the principal. Faced with the results of action purportedly done on his behalf but without authorization \nand through no fault of his own, he may affirm or disavow them as he chooses. To ratify, the principal may \ntell the parties concerned or by his conduct manifest that he is willing to accept the results as though the \nact were authorized. Or by his silence he may find under certain circumstances that he has ratified. Note \nthat ratification does not require the usual consideration of contract law. The principal need be promised \nnothing extra for his decision to affirm to be binding on him. Nor does ratification depend on the position \nof the third party; for example, a loss stemming from his reliance on the agent’s representations is not \nrequired. In most situations, ratification leaves the parties where they expected to be, correcting the \nagent’s errors harmlessly and giving each party what was expected. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n422 \n \nThe principal is liable on an agent’s contract only if the agent was authorized by the principal to make the \ncontract. Such authority is express, implied, or apparent. Express means made in words, orally or in \nwriting; implied means the agent has authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to \ncarrying out the transaction for which she has express authority. Apparent authority arises where the principal \ngives the third party reason to believe that the agent had authority. The reasonableness of the third party’s \nbelief is based on all the circumstances—all the facts. Even if the agent has no authority, the principal may, \nafter the fact, ratify the contract made by the agent. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors. The plumber who rushes to a client’s house to repair a leak and causes a traffic accident does \nnot subject the homeowner to liability. But there are exceptions to the rule. Generally, these exceptions \nfall into a category of duties that the law deems nondelegable. In some situations, one person is obligated \nto provide protection to or care for another. The failure to do so results in liability whether or not the \nharm befell the other because of an independent contractor’s wrongdoing. Thus a homeowner has a duty \nto ensure that physical conditions in and around the home are not unreasonably dangerous. If the owner \nhires an independent contracting firm to dig a sewer line and the contractor negligently fails to guard \npassersby against the danger of falling into an open trench, the homeowner is liable because the duty of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n426 \ncare in this instance cannot be delegated. (The contractor is, of course, liable to the homeowner for any \ndamages paid to an injured passerby.) \n \nLiability for Agent’s Intentional Torts \nIn the nineteenth century, a principal was rarely held liable for intentional wrongdoing by the agent if the \nprincipal did not command the act complained of. The thought was that one could never infer authority to \ncommit a willfully wrongful act. Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal if the \nagent is acting to further the principal’s business. See the very disturbing Lyon v. Carey in Section 10.4.2 \n\"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: Scope of Employment\". \nDeviations from Employment \nThe general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if the servant committed them “in the scope of \nemployment.” But determining what this means is not easy. \n \nThe “Scope of Employment” Problem \nIt may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent of another. But a principal cannot be \nresponsible for every act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of his instructions, it will be \neasy to determine liability. But suppose an agent deviates in some way from his job. The classic test of \nliability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison. [1] The plaintiff was run over on a highway \nby a speeding cart and horse. The driver was the employee of another, and inside was a fellow employee. \nThere was no question that the driver had acted carelessly, but what he and his fellow employee were \ndoing on the road where the plaintiff was injured was disputed. For weeks before and after the accident, \nthe cart had never been driven in the vicinity in which the plaintiff was walking, nor did it have any \nbusiness there. The suggestion was that the employees might have gone out of their way for their own \npurposes. As the great English jurist Baron Parke put it, “If the servants, being on their master’s business, \ntook a detour to call upon a friend, the master will be responsible.…But if he was going on a frolic of his \nown, without being at all on his master’s business, the master will not be liable.” In applying this test, the \ncourt held the employer liable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n427 \nThe test is thus one of degree, and it is not always easy to decide when a detour has become so great as to \nbe transformed into a frolic. For a time, a rather mechanical rule was invoked to aid in making the \ndecision. The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply.

Suppose he decides to stop by the beach, which is far away from his route. Does it \nmake a difference if the employer knows that his deliverymen do this? \n \nThe Zone of Risk Test \nCourt decisions in the last forty years have moved toward a different standard, one that looks to the \nforeseeability of the agent’s conduct. By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for \nvicarious liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be, doing—more or less—what she is \nsupposed to be doing, and the incident arose from the employee’s pursuit of the employer’s interest \n(again, more or less). That is, the employer is within the zone of risk if the servant is in the place within \nwhich, if the master were to send out a search party to find a missing employee, it would be reasonable to \nlook. See Section 4, Cockrell v. Pearl River Valley Water Supply Dist. \n \nSpecial Cases of Vicarious Liability \nVicarious liability is not limited to harm caused in the course of an agency relationship. It may also be \nimposed in other areas, including torts of family members, and other torts governed by statute or \nregulation. We will examine each in turn. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n428 \n \nUse of Automobiles \nA problem commonly arises when an automobile owner lends his vehicle to a personal friend, someone \nwho is not an agent, and the borrower injures a third person. Is the owner liable? In many states, the \nowner is not liable; in other states, however, two approaches impose liability on the owner. \nThe first approach is legislative: owner’s consent statutes make the owner liable when the automobile \nis being driven with his consent or knowledge. The second approach to placing liability on the owner is \njudicial and known as the family purpose doctrine. Under this doctrine, a family member who \nnegligently injures someone with the car subjects the owner to liability if the family member was \nfurthering family purposes. These are loosely defined to include virtually every use to which a child, for \nexample, might put a car. In a Georgia case, Dixon v. Phillips, the father allowed his minor son to drive \nthe car but expressly forbade him from letting anyone else do so. [2] Nevertheless, the son gave the wheel \nto a friend and a collision occurred while both were in the car. The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction \n(to which Mr. Dickens’s Mr. Bumble responded, in the memorable line, “If the law supposes that, the law \nis a ass—a idiot” [4]). This ancient view has been abrogated by statute or by court ruling in all the states, so \nthat now a wife is solely responsible for her own torts unless she in fact serves as her husband’s agent. \n \nUnlike wives, children are not presumed at common law to be agents or extensions of the father so that \nnormally parents are not vicariously liable for their children’s torts. However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers. Thus the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n429 \nIllinois Parental Responsibility Law provides the following: “The parent or legal guardian of an \nunemancipated minor who resides with such parent or legal guardian is liable for actual damages for the",

            "chunk": "acting on behalf of a principal. The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal. Who may enforce the contracts against them? \n \nThe developer and the agents may sue to compel transfer of title. The undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal may act to enforce his rights unless the contract specifically prohibits it or there is a \nrepresentation that the signatories are not signing for an undisclosed principal. The agents may also bring \nsuit to enforce the principal’s contract rights because, as agents for an undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal, they are considered parties to their contracts. \n \nNow suppose the developer attempts to call off the deal. Whom may the sellers sue? Both the developer \nand the agents are liable. That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there \nwas a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may \nstill recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior \nto winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the \nplaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway. Similarly, if the \nseller sues the principal and recovers a judgment, the agents are relieved of liability. The seller thus has a \n“right of election” to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, a right that in many states may be \nexercised any time before the seller collects on the judgment. \n \n \nLack of Authority in Agent \nAn agent who purports to make a contract on behalf of a principal, but who in fact has no authority to do \nso, is liable to the other party. The theory is that the agent has warranted to the third party that he has the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n434 \nrequisite authority. The principal is not liable in the absence of apparent authority or ratification. But the \nagent does not warrant that the principal has capacity. Thus an agent for a minor is not liable on a \ncontract that the minor later disavows unless the agent expressly warranted that the principal had \nattained his majority. In short, the implied warranty is that the agent has authority to make a deal, not \nthat the principal will necessarily comply with the contract once the deal is made. \n \nAgent Acting on Own Account \nAn agent will be liable on contracts made in a personal capacity—for instance, when the agent personally \nguarantees repayment of a debt. The agent’s intention to be personally liable is often difficult to determine \non the basis of his signature on a contract. Generally, a person signing a contract can avoid personal \nliability only by showing that he was in fact signing as an agent. If the contract is signed “Jones, Agent,” \nJones can introduce evidence to show that there was never an intention to hold him personally liable. But \nif he signed “Jones” and neither his agency nor the principal’s name is included, he will be personally \nliable. This can be troublesome to agents who routinely indorse checks and notes. There are special rules \ngoverning these situations, which are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\" dealing with \ncommercial paper. \n \nTermination of Agency \nThe agency relationship is not permanent. Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the",

As she was fixing her \nmakeup using the mirror on the sun visor, Officer James pulled his patrol car into a church parking lot \nand parked the car. He then pulled Cockrell towards him in an embrace and began stroking her back and \nhair telling her that things would be fine. Cockrell told Officer James to release her, but he continued to \nembrace her for approximately five minutes before continuing on to the jail. \n \nOn June 30, 1998, Cockrell returned to the Reservoir Patrol office to retrieve her driver’s license. Officer \nJames called Cockrell into his office and discussed her DUI charge with her. As she was leaving, Officer \nJames grabbed her from behind, turned her around, pinned both of her arms behind her and pulled her to \nhis chest. When Officer James bent down to kiss her, she ducked her head, thus causing Officer James to \ninstead kiss her forehead.

[Subsequently, Cockrell’s attorney threatened civil suit against Patrol; James was fired in October \n1998.] \n \nOn September 22, 1999, Cockrell filed a complaint for damages against the District alleging that on the \nnights of June 28 and June 30, 1998, Officer James was acting within the course and scope of his \nemployment with the District and that he acted with reckless disregard for her emotional well-being and \nsafety.…On April 2, 2002, the District filed its motion for summary judgment alleging that there was no \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n449 \ngenuine issue of material fact regarding Cockrell’s claim of liability. The motion alleged that the conduct \ndescribed by Cockrell was outside the course and scope of Officer James’s public employment as he was \nintending to satisfy his lustful urges. Cockrell responded to the motion arguing that the misconduct did \noccur in the course and scope of Officer James’s employment with the District and also that the \nmisconduct did not reach the level of a criminal offense such that the District could be found not liable \nunder the MTCA. \n \nThe trial court entered a final judgment granting the District’s motion for summary judgment and \ndismissing the complaint with prejudice.

Cockrell argues Officer James’s conduct, although inappropriate, \ndid not rise to the level of criminal conduct. Cockrell contends Officer James’s action of hugging Cockrell \nwas similar to an officer consoling a victim of a crime. Cockrell does admit that Officer James’s action of \nkissing her is more difficult to view as within the course and scope of his employment… \n \nThe District argues that although Officer James acted within the course and scope of his duties when he \narrested Cockrell, his later conduct, which was intended to satisfy his lustful desires, was outside the \nscope of his employment with it.… \n \n“Mississippi law provides that an activity must be in furtherance of the employer’s business to be within \nthe scope and course of employment.” [Citation] To be within the course and scope of employment, an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n450 \nactivity must carry out the employer’s purpose of the employment or be in furtherance of the employer’s \nbusiness.

[6] But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and \nthe partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment \nagainst a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating \nthat partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in \npartnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership. [8] Under RUPA, \n“property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.” [9] But RUPA \nis no different from UPA in practical effect. The latter provides that “property originally brought into the \npartnership stock or subsequently acquired by purchase…on account of the partnership, is partnership \nproperty.” [10] Under either law, a partner may bring onto the partnership premises her own property, not \nacquired in the name of the partnership or with its credit, and it remains her separate property. Under \nneither law can a partner unilaterally dispose of partnership property, however labeled, for the obvious \nreason that one cannot dispose of another’s property or property rights without permission.

One salient change made by RUPA \nis to directly announce that a partnership is an entity: it is like a person for purposes of accounting, litigation, \nbankruptcy, and owning real estate. Partnerships do not pay taxes; the individual partners do. But in practical \nterms, what RUPA does is codify already-existing state law on these matters, and partners are free to organize \ntheir relationship as they like in the partnership agreement. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The answer can be important: if one of the owners while doing business pertinent to the \nproperty injures a stranger, the latter could sue the other owners if there is a partnership. \n \nCo-ownership comes in many guises. The four most common are joint tenancy, tenancy in common, \ntenancy by the entireties, and community property. In joint tenancy, the owners hold the property under a \nsingle instrument, such as a deed, and if one dies, the others automatically become owners of the \ndeceased’s share, which does not descend to his heirs. Tenancy in common has the reverse rule: the \nsurvivor tenants do not take the deceased’s share. Each tenant in common has a distinct estate in the \nproperty. The tenancy by the entirety and community property (in community-property states) forms of \nownership are limited to spouses, and their effects are similar to that of joint tenancy. \n \nSuppose a husband and wife who own their home as tenants by the entirety (or community property) \ndecide to spend the summer at the seashore and rent their home for three months. Is their co-ownership \nsufficient to establish that they are partners? The answer is no.

To establish a partnership, the ownership \nmust be of a business, not merely of property. \n \nSharing of Profits \nThere are two aspects to consider with regard to profits: first, whether the business is for-profit, and \nsecond, whether there is a sharing of the profit. \n \nBusiness for Profit \nUnincorporated nonprofit organizations (UNAs) cannot be partnerships. The paucity of coherent law \ngoverning these organizations gave rise in 2005 to the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform \nLaws’ promulgation of the Revised Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (RUUNAA). The \nprefatory note to this act says, “RUUNAA was drafted with small informal associations in mind. These \ninformal organizations are likely to have no legal advice and so fail to consider legal and organizational \nquestions, including whether to incorporate. The act provides better answers than the common law for a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n469 \nlimited number of legal problems…There are probably hundreds of thousands of UNAs in the United \nStates including unincorporated nonprofit philanthropic, educational, scientific and literary clubs, \nsporting organizations, unions, trade associations, political organizations, churches, hospitals, and \ncondominium and neighborhood associations.” [4] At least twelve states have adopted RUUNAA or its \npredecessor. \n \nSharing the Profit \nWhile co-ownership does not establish a partnership unless there is a business, a business by itself is not a \npartnership unless co-ownership is present. Of the tests used by courts to determine co-ownership, \nperhaps the most important is sharing of profits. Section 202(c) of RUPA provides that “a person who \nreceives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business,” but this \npresumption can be rebutted by showing that the share of the profits paid out was (1) to repay a debt; (2) \nwages or compensation to an independent contractor; (3) rent; (4) an annuity, retirement, or health \nbenefit to a representative of a deceased or retired partner; (5) interest on a loan, or rights to income, \nproceeds, or increase in value from collateral; or (5) for the sale of the goodwill of a business or other \nproperty. Section 7(4) of UPA is to the same effect. \n \nOther Factors \nCourts are not limited to the profit-sharing test; they also look at these factors, among others: the right to \nparticipate in decision making, the duty to share liabilities, and the manner in which the business is \noperated. Section 11.3.1 \"Tests of Partnership Existence\", Chaiken v. Employment Security Commission, \nillustrates how these factors are weighed in court. \n \nCreation of Partnership by Estoppel \nOrdinarily, if two people are not legally partners, then third parties cannot so regard them. For example, \nMr. Tot and Mr. Tut own equal shares of a house that they rent but do not regard it as a business and are \nnot in fact partners. They do have a loose “understanding” that since Mr. Tot is mechanically adept, he \nwill make necessary repairs whenever the tenants call. On his way to the house one day to fix its boiler, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n470 \nMr. Tot injures a pedestrian, who sues both Mr. Tot and Mr. Tut. Since they are not partners, the \npedestrian cannot sue them as if they were; hence Mr. Tut has no partnership liability.",

If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important. Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade. The paragraph also declared that upon \ndissolution of the partnership, ownership of items would revert to the party providing them. The third \nparagraph declared that the income of the partnership would be divided 30% for Chaiken, 70% for \nStrazella; 20% for Chaiken and 80% for Spitzer. The fourth paragraph declared that all partnership policy \nwould be decided by Chaiken, whose decision was final. The fifth paragraph forbade assignment of the \nagreement without permission of Chaiken. The sixth paragraph required Chaiken to hold and distribute \nall receipts. The final paragraph stated hours of work for Strazella and Spitzer and holidays. \n \nThe mere existence of an agreement labeled “partnership” agreement and the characterization of \nsignatories as “partners” docs not conclusively prove the existence of a partnership. Rather, the intention \nof the parties, as explained by the wording of the agreement, is paramount. \n \nA partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for \nprofit. As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept. Co-owners should also contribute valuable consideration \nfor the creation of the business. Under paragraph two, however, Chaiken provides the barber chair (and \nimplicitly the barber shop itself), mirror, licenses and linen, while the other partners merely provide their \ntools and labor—nothing more than any barber-employee would furnish. Standing alone, however, mere \ncontribution of work and skill can be valuable consideration for a partnership agreement. \n \nPartnership interests may be assignable, although it is not a violation of partnership law to prohibit \nassignment in a partnership agreement. Therefore, paragraph five on assignment of partnership interests \ndoes not violate the partnership concept. On the other hand, distribution of partnership assets to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n475 \npartners upon dissolution is only allowed after all partnership liabilities are satisfied. But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent,",

If the partners should happen to continue their business beyond the \nterm fixed for it in their agreement, the terms of the agreement continue to apply. \n \nDuties Partners Owe Each Other \nAmong the duties partners owe each other, six may be called out here: (1) the duty to serve, (2) the duty of \nloyalty, (3) the duty of care, (4) the duty of obedience, (5) the duty to inform copartners, and (6) the duty \nto account to the partnership. These are all very similar to the duty owed by an agent to the principal, as \npartnership law is based on agency concepts. [2] \n \nDuty to Serve \nUnless otherwise agreed, expressly or impliedly, a partner is expected to work for the firm. The \npartnership, after all, is a profit-making co-venture, and it would not do for one to loaf about and still \nexpect to get paid. For example, suppose Joan takes her two-week vacation from the horse-stable \npartnership she operates with Sarah and Sandra. Then she does not return for four months because she \nhas gone horseback riding in the Southwest. She might end up having to pay if the partnership hired a \nsubstitute to do her work. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n493 \nIn general, this requires partners to put the firm’s interests ahead of their own. Partners are fiduciaries as \nto each other and as to the partnership, and as such, they owe a fiduciary duty to each other and the \npartnership. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty “something \nstricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most \nsensitive, is then the standard of behavior.” [3]Breach of the fiduciary duty gives rise to a claim for \ncompensatory, consequential, and incidental damages; recoupment of compensation; and—rarely—\npunitive damages. See Section 12.4.1 \"Breach of Partnership Fiduciary Duty\", Gilroy v. Conway, for an \nexample of breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n \nApplication of the Fiduciary Standard to Partnership Law \nUnder UPA, all partners are fiduciaries of each other—they are all principals and agents of each other—\nthough the word fiduciary was not used except in the heading to Section 21. The section reads, “Every \npartner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by \nhim without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, \nconduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.” \n \nSection 404 of RUPA specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other \npartners. It imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three circumstances: \n \n(1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived \nby the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use \nby the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership \nopportunity; \n \n(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership \nbusiness as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n494 \n(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business \nbefore the dissolution of the partnership. \n \nLimits on the Reach of the Fiduciary Duty \nThis sets out a fairly limited scope for application of the fiduciary standard, which is reasonable because \npartners do not delegate open-ended control to their copartners. Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached.",

Understand the dissolution of general partnerships under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). \n2. Understand the dissociation and dissolution of general partnerships under the Revised Uniform Partnership \nAct (RUPA). \n3. Explain the winding up of partnerships under UPA and RUPA. \n \n \nIt is said that a partnership is like a marriage, and that extends to its ending too. It’s easier to get into a \npartnership than it is to get out of it because legal entanglements continue after a person is no longer a \npartner. The rules governing “getting out” of a partnership are different under the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) than under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). We take up UPA first. \n \nDissolution of Partnerships under UPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n512 \nDissolution, in the most general sense, means a separation into component parts. \n \nMeaning of Dissolution under UPA \nPeople in business are sometimes confused about the meaning of dissolution. It does not mean the \ntermination of a business. It has a precise legal definition, given in UPA Section 29: “The dissolution of a \npartnership is the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in \nthe carrying on as distinguished from the winding up of the business.” The partnership is not necessarily \nterminated on dissolution; rather, it continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed, \nand the remaining partners may choose to continue on as a new partnership if they want. [1] But, again, \nunder UPA the partnership dissolves upon the withdrawal of any partner. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nPartnerships can dissolve for a number of reasons. [2] \n \nIn Accordance with the Agreement \nThe term of the partnership agreement may have expired or the partnership may be at will and one of the \npartners desires to leave it. All the partners may decide that it is preferable to dissolve rather than to \ncontinue. One of the partners may have been expelled in accordance with a provision in the agreement. In \nnone of these circumstances is the agreement violated, though its spirit surely might have been. Professor \nSamuelson calls to mind the example of William Dean Howells’s Silas Lapham, who forces his partner to \nsell out by offering him an ultimatum: “You may buy me out or I’ll buy you out.” The ultimatum was given \nat a time when the partner could not afford to buy Lapham out, so the partner had no choice. \n \nIn Violation of the Agreement \nDissolution may also result from violation of the agreement, as when the partners decide to discharge a \npartner though no provision permits them to do so, or as when a partner decides to quit in violation of a \nterm agreement. In the former case, the remaining partners are liable for damages for wrongful \ndissolution, and in the latter case, the withdrawing partner is liable to the remaining partners the same \nway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n513 \n \nBy Operation of Law \nA third reason for dissolution is the occurrence of some event, such as enactment of a statute, that makes \nit unlawful to continue the business. Or a partner may die or one or more partners or the entire \npartnership may become bankrupt. Dissolution under these circumstances is said to be by operation of \nlaw. [3] \n \nBy Court Order \nFinally, dissolution may be by court order. Courts are empowered to dissolve partnerships when “on \napplication by or for a partner” a partner is shown to be a lunatic, of unsound mind, incapable of \nperforming his part of the agreement, “guilty of such conduct as tends to affect prejudicially the carrying \non of the business,” or otherwise behaves in such a way that “it is not reasonably practicable to carry on \nthe business in partnership with him.” A court may also order dissolution if the business can only be \ncarried on at a loss or whenever equitable. In some circumstances, a court will order dissolution upon the \napplication of a purchaser of a partner’s interest. [4] \n \nEffect of Dissolution on Authority \nFor the most part, dissolution terminates the authority of the partners to act for the partnership. The only \nsignificant exceptions are for acts necessary to wind up partnership affairs or to complete transactions",

The statements provide a mechanism for the remaining partners to wind up the partnership's affairs and distribute the remaining assets among the partners.

If a partner commits a crime while acting within the scope of their partnership duties, the partnership may be liable for the crime. This is because the partnership is considered to be the agent of the partner in such cases. Additionally, the partnership may be liable if a partner commits a crime that is related to the partnership's business. For example, if a partner embezzles funds from the partnership, the partnership may be liable for the embezzlement."

                    "answer": "A partnership is taxed more favorably than a corporation because it is not subject to the corporate income tax. Instead, the profits and losses of the partnership are passed through to the partners, who are then responsible for paying taxes on their share of the partnership's income. This allows the partners to avoid double taxation, which is when the same income is taxed at both the corporate and individual level. Additionally, partnerships are not subject to the corporate income tax rate, which is typically higher than the individual income tax rate. As a result, partnerships can often save money on taxes compared to corporations."

According to the comment, RUPA \ndramatically changes the law governing partnership breakups and dissolution. An entirely new concept, \n“dissociation,” is used in lieu of UPA term “dissolution” to denote the change in the relationship caused by \na partner’s ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business. “Dissolution” is retained but with a \ndifferent meaning. The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm \nitself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. \n \nUnder UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any \nmember from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an \nentity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs \nwhen any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA \nrequires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. \n \nDissociation \nDissociation, as noted in the previous paragraph, is the change in relations caused by a partner’s \nwithdrawal from the firm’s business. \n \nCauses of Dissociation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n517 \nDissociation is caused in ten possible ways: (1) a partner says she wants out; (2) an event triggers \ndissociation as per the partnership agreement; (3) a partner is expelled as per the agreement; (4) a \npartner is expelled by unanimous vote of the others because it is unlawful to carry on with that partner, \nbecause that partner has transferred to a transferee all interest in the partnership (except for security \npurposes), or because a corporate partner’s or partnership partner’s existence is effectively terminated; \n(5) by a court order upon request by the partnership or another partner because the one expelled has been \ndetermined to have misbehaved (engaged in serious wrongful conduct, persists in abusing the agreement, \nacts in ways making continuing the business impracticable); (6) the partner has declared bankruptcy; (7) \nthe partner has died or had a guardian appointed, or has been adjudicated as incompetent; (8) the partner \nis a trust whose assets are exhausted; (9) the partner is an estate and the estate’s interest in the \npartnership has been entirely transferred; (10) the partner dies or, if the partner is another partnership or \na corporation trust or estate, that entity’s existence is terminated. [11] \n \nEffect of Dissociation \nAfter a partner dissociates, the partner’s right to participate in management terminates. (However, if the \ndissociation goes on to dissolution and winding up, partners who have not wrongfully caused the \ndissociation may participate in winding-up activities.) [12] The dissociated partner’s duty of loyalty and \ncare terminates; the former partner may compete with the firm, except for matters arising before the \ndissociation. [13] \n \nWhen partners come and go, as they do, problems may arise. What power does the dissociated partner \nhave to bind the partnership? What power does the partnership have to impose liability on the dissociated \none? RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or \nher apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would \nhave bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the \ndissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have",

The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm itself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. Under UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any member from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an entity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs when any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA requires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. Dissociation Dissociation, as noted in the previous paragraph, is the change in relations caused by a partner’s withdrawal from the firm’s business. Causes of Dissociation Dissociation is caused in ten possible ways: (1) a partner says she wants out; (2) an event triggers dissociation as per the partnership agreement; (3) a partner is expelled as per the agreement; (4) a partner is expelled by unanimous vote of the others because it is unlawful to carry on with that partner, because that partner has transferred to a transferee all interest in the partnership (except for security purposes), or because a corporate partner’s or partnership partner’s existence is effectively terminated; (5) by a court order upon request by the partnership or another partner because the one expelled has been determined to have misbehaved (engaged in serious wrongful conduct, persists in abusing the agreement, acts in ways making continuing the business impracticable); (6) the partner has declared bankruptcy; (7) the partner has died or had a guardian appointed, or has been adjudicated as incompetent; (8) the partner is a trust whose assets are exhausted; (9) the partner is an estate and the estate’s interest in the partnership has been entirely transferred; (10) the partner dies or, if the partner is another partnership or a corporation trust or estate, that entity’s existence is terminated. [11] Effect of Dissociation After a partner dissociates, the partner’s right to participate in management terminates. (However, if the dissociation goes on to dissolution and winding up, partners who have not wrongfully caused the dissociation may participate in winding-up activities.) [12] The dissociated partner’s duty of loyalty and care terminates; the former partner may compete with the firm, except for matters arising before the dissociation. [13] When partners come and go, as they do, problems may arise. What power does the dissociated partner have to bind the partnership? What power does the partnership have to impose liability on the dissociated one? RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or her apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would have bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the dissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have",
                    "answer": "Third, is Alice, the new partner, liable to creditors of the old partnership? Yes, but only to the extent of her capital contribution. [10] Fourth, is Baker, the old partner, liable for debts incurred after his withdrawal from the partnership? Surprisingly, yes, unless Baker takes certain action toward old and new creditors. He must provide actual notice that he has withdrawn to anyone who has extended credit in the past. Once he has done so, he has no liability to these creditors for credit extended to the partnership thereafter. Of course, it would be difficult to provide notice to future creditors, since at the time of withdrawal they would not have had a relationship with the partnership. To avoid liability to new creditors who knew of the partnership, the solution required under UPA Section 35(l)(b)(II) is to advertise Baker’s departure in a general circulation newspaper in the place where the partnership business was regularly carried on. Winding Up and Termination Because the differences between UPA’s and RUPA’s provisions for winding up and termination are not as significant as those between their provisions for dissolution, the discussion for winding up and termination will cover both acts at once, following the discussion of dissociation and dissolution under RUPA. Dissociation and Dissolution of Partnerships under RUPA Comment 1 to RUPA Section 601 is a good lead-in to this section. According to the comment, RUPA dramatically changes the law governing partnership breakups and dissolution. An entirely new concept, “dissociation,” is used in lieu of UPA term “dissolution” to denote the change in the relationship caused by a partner’s ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business. “Dissolution” is retained but with a different meaning. The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm itself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. Under UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any member from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an entity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs when any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA requires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. Dissociation Dissociation, as noted in the previous paragraph, is the change in relations caused by a partner’s withdrawal from the firm’s business. Causes of Dissociation Dissociation is caused in ten possible ways: (1) a partner says she wants out; (2) an event triggers dissociation as per the partnership agreement; (3) a partner is expelled as per the agreement; (4) a partner is expelled by unanimous vote of the others because it is unlawful to carry on with that partner, because that partner has transferred to a transferee all interest in the partnership (except for security purposes), or because a corporate partner’s or partnership partner’s existence is effectively terminated; (5) by a court order upon request by the partnership or another partner because the one expelled has been determined to have misbehaved (engaged in serious wrongful conduct, persists in abusing the agreement, acts in ways making continuing the business impracticable); (6) the partner has declared bankruptcy; (7) the partner has died or had a guardian appointed, or has been adjudicated as incompetent; (8) the partner is a trust whose assets are exhausted; (9) the partner is an estate and the estate’s interest in the partnership has been entirely transferred; (10) the partner dies or, if the partner is another partnership or a corporation trust or estate, that entity’s existence is terminated.

            "chunk": "business, or substantially all of it. For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable. For example, if \nCreditor gets a charging order against Paul Partner and the obligation cannot reasonably be paid by the \nfirm, a court could order dissolution so Creditor would get paid from the liquidated assets of the firm. \n \nEffect of Dissolution \nA partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. The partnership \nis terminated when the winding up of its business is completed. [19] However, before winding up is \ncompleted, the partners—except any wrongfully dissociating—may agree to carry on the partnership, in \nwhich case it resumes business as if dissolution never happened. [20] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n520 \n \nContinuing after Dissociation \nDissociation, again, does not necessarily cause dissolution. In an at-will partnership, the death (including \ntermination of an entity partner), bankruptcy, incapacity, or expulsion of a partner will not cause \ndissolution. [21] In a term partnership, the firm continues if, within ninety days of an event triggering \ndissociation, fewer than half the partners express their will to wind up. The partnership agreement may \nprovide that RUPA’s dissolution-triggering events, including dissociation, will not trigger dissolution. \nHowever, the agreement cannot change the rules that dissolution is caused by the business becoming \nillegal or by court order. Creditors of the partnership remain as before, and the dissociated partner is \nliable for partnership obligations arising before dissociation. \n \nSection 701 of RUPA provides that if the firm continues in business after a partner dissociates, without \nwinding up, then the partnership must purchase the dissociated partner’s interest; RUPA Section 701(b) \nexplains how to determine the buyout price. It is the amount that would have been distributed to the \ndissociated partner if, on the date of dissociation, the firm’s assets were sold “at a price equal to the \ngreater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern,” \nminus damages for wrongful dissociation. A wrongful dissociater may have to wait a while to get paid in \nfull, unless a court determines that immediate payment “will not cause an undue hardship to the \npartnership,” but the longest nonwrongful dissociaters need to wait is 120 days. [22] A dissociated partner \ncan sue the firm to determine the buyout price and the court may assess attorney’s, appraiser’s, and \nexpert’s fees against a party the court finds “acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or in bad faith.”[23] \n \nWinding Up the Partnership under UPA and RUPA \nIf the partners decide not to continue the business upon dissolution, they are obliged to wind up the \nbusiness. The partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business, \nafter which it is terminated. [24]Winding up entails concluding all unfinished business pending at the \ndate of dissolution and payment of all debts. The partners must then settle accounts among themselves in \norder to distribute the remaining assets. At any time after dissolution and before winding up is completed, \nthe partners (except a wrongfully dissociated one) can stop the process and carry on the business. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n521 \n \nUPA and RUPA are not significantly different as to winding up, so they will be discussed together. Two \nissues are discussed here: who can participate in winding up and how the assets of the firm are distributed \non liquidation. \n \nWho Can Participate in Winding Up \nThe partners who have not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership \nbusiness. On application of any partner, a court may for good cause judicially supervise the winding up. [25] \n \nSettlement of Accounts among Partners \nDetermining the priority of liabilities can be problematic. For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and",

To that end, Southern Oaks and Horizon entered \ninto several partnership and management contracts in 1993. \n \nIn 1996, Southern Oaks filed suit alleging numerous defaults and breaches of the twenty-year \nagreements.…[T]he trial court found largely in favor of Southern Oaks, concluding that Horizon breached \nits obligations under two different partnership agreements [and that] Horizon had breached several \nmanagement contracts. Thereafter, the court ordered that the partnerships be dissolved, finding that “the \nparties to the various agreements which are the subject of this lawsuit are now incapable of continuing to \noperate in business together” and that because it was dissolving the partnerships, “there is no entitlement \nto future damages.…” In its cross appeal, Southern Oaks asserts that because Horizon unilaterally and \nwrongfully sought dissolution of the partnerships, Southern Oaks should receive a damage award for the \nloss of the partnerships’ seventeen remaining years’ worth of future profits. We reject its argument. \n \nSouthern Oaks argues Horizon wrongfully caused the dissolution because the basis for dissolution cited \nby the court is not one of the grounds for which the parties contracted. The pertinent contracts provided \nin section 7.3 “Causes of Dissolution”: “In addition to the causes for dissolution set forth in Section 7.2(c), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n539 \nthe Partnership shall be dissolved in the event that:…(d) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the \nother Partner, either Partner elects to dissolve the Partnership on account of an Irreconcilable Difference \nwhich arises and cannot, after good faith efforts, be resolved.…” \n \nSouthern Oaks argues that what Horizon relied on at trial as showing irreconcilable differences—the \ndecisions of how profits were to be determined and divided—were not “good faith differences of opinion,” \nnor did they have “a material and adverse impact on the conduct of the Partnerships’ Business.” Horizon’s \nrefusal to pay Southern Oaks according to the terms of the contracts was not an “irreconcilable difference” \nas defined by the contract, Southern Oaks asserts, pointing out that Horizon’s acts were held to be \nbreaches of the contracts. Because there was no contract basis for dissolution, Horizon’s assertion of \ndissolution was wrongful, Southern Oaks concludes. \n \nSouthern Oaks contends further that not only were there no contractual grounds for dissolution, \ndissolution was also wrongful under the Florida Statutes. Southern Oaks argues that pursuant to section \n[of that statute] Horizon had the power to dissociate from the partnership, but, in the absence of contract \ngrounds for the dissociation, Horizon wrongfully dissociated. It asserts that it is entitled to lost future \nprofits under Florida’s partnership law.… \n \nWe find Southern Oaks’ argument without merit. First, the trial court’s finding that the parties are \nincapable of continuing to operate in business together is a finding of “irreconcilable differences,” a \npermissible reason for dissolving the partnerships under the express terms of the partnership agreements. \nThus, dissolution was not “wrongful,” assuming there can be “wrongful” dissolutions, and Southern Oaks \nwas not entitled to damages for lost future profits. Additionally, the partnership contracts also permit \ndissolution by “judicial decree.” Although neither party cites this provision, it appears that pursuant \nthereto, the parties agreed that dissolution would be proper if done by a trial court for whatever reason \nthe court found sufficient to warrant dissolution. \n \nSecond, even assuming the partnership was dissolved for a reason not provided for in the partnership \nagreements, damages were properly denied. Under RUPA, it is clear that wrongful dissociation triggers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n540 \nliability for lost future profits. See [RUPA:] “A partner who wrongfully dissociates is liable to the \npartnership and to the other partners for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition \nto any other obligation of the partner to the partnership or to the other partners.” However, RUPA \ndoes not contain a similar provision for dissolution; RUPA does not refer to the dissolutions as rightful or \nwrongful. [RUPA sets out] “Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership business,” [and] \noutlines the events causing dissolution without any provision for liability for damages.…[RUPA] \nrecognizes judicial dissolution: \n \nA partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only upon the occurrence of any of \nthe following events:… \n \n(5) On application by a partner, a judicial determination that: \n(a) The economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; \n(b) Another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business which makes it \nnot reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with such partner; or",

While “reasonably \npracticable” is not defined in RUPA, the term is broad enough to encompass the inability of partners to \ncontinue working together, which is what the court found. \n \nCertainly the law predating RUPA allowed for recovery of lost profits upon the wrongful dissolution of a \npartnership. See e.g., [Citation]: “A partner who assumes to dissolve the partnership before the end of the \nterm agreed on in the partnership articles is liable, in an action at law against him by his co-partner for \nthe breach of the agreement, to respond in damages for the value of the profits which the plaintiff would \notherwise have received.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n541 \nHowever, RUPA brought significant changes to partnership law, among which was the adoption of the \nterm “dissociation.” Although the term is undefined in RUPA, dissociation appears to have taken the place \nof “dissolution” as that word was used pre-RUPA. “Dissolution” under RUPA has a different meaning, \nalthough the term is undefined in RUPA. It follows that the pre-RUPA cases providing for future damages \nupon wrongful dissolution are no longer applicable to a partnership dissolution. In other words a \n“wrongful dissolution” referred to in the pre-RUPA case law is now, under RUPA, known as “wrongful \ndissociation.” Simply stated, under [RUPA], only when a partner dissociates and the dissociation is \nwrongful can the remaining partners sue for damages. When a partnership is dissolved, RUPA…provides \nthe parameters of liability of the partners upon dissolution.… \n \n[Citation]: “Dissociation is not a condition precedent to dissolution.…Most dissolution events are \ndissociations. On the other hand, it is not necessary to have a dissociation to cause a dissolution and \nwinding up.” \n \nSouthern Oaks’ attempt to bring the instant dissolution under the statute applicable to dissociation is \nrejected. The trial court ordered dissolution of the partnership, not the dissociation of Horizon for \nwrongful conduct. There no longer appears to be “wrongful” dissolution—either dissolution is provided \nfor by contract or statute or the dissolution was improper and the dissolution order should be reversed. In \nthe instant case, because the dissolution either came within the terms of the partnership agreements or \n[RUPA] (judicial dissolution where it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the partnership business), \nSouthern Oaks’ claim for lost future profits is without merit.

Ordinarily, partners operate through majority vote, but no act that contravenes the \npartnership agreement itself can be undertaken without unanimous consent. \n \nPartners’ rights include rights (1) to distributions of money, including profits (and losses) as per the \nagreement or equally, indemnification, and return of capital contribution (but not a right to",

An assignment is usually made as security for a loan. The assignee \nbecomes a new limited partner only if all the others consent or if provided for in the certificate; the \nassignment does not cause dissolution. The happy ease with which a limited partner can divest himself of \nthe partnership interest makes the investment in the firm here more like that in a corporation than in a \ngeneral partnership. \n \n \n \n \nInspection of Books \nLimited partners have the right to inspect the firm’s books and records, they may own competing \ninterests, they may be creditors of the firm, and they may bring derivative suits on the firm’s behalf. They \nmay not withdraw their capital contribution if that would impair creditors’ rights. \n \nAddition of New Partners \nUnless the partnership agreement provides otherwise (it usually does), the admission of additional \nlimited partners requires the written consent of all. A general partner may withdraw at any time with \nwritten notice; if withdrawal is a violation of the agreement, the limited partnership has a right to claim of \ndamages. A limited partner can withdraw any time after six months’ notice to each general partner, and \nthe withdrawing partner is entitled to any distribution as per the agreement or, if none, to the fair value of \nthe interest based on the right to share in distributions. \n \nCompensation \nWe noted in discussing partnerships that the partners are not entitled to “compensation,” that is, payment \nfor their work; they are entitled to a share of the profits. For limited partnerships, the rule is a bit \ndifferent. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n553 \nGeneral Partners \nOften, general partners are paid for their management work on a sliding scale, receiving a greater share of \neach dollar of cash flow as the limited partners’ cash distributions rise, thus giving the general partner an \nincentive to increase limited-partner distributions. \n \nLimited Partners \nProfits or losses are shared as agreed in the certificate or, if there is no agreement, in accordance with the \npercentages of capital contributions made. \n \nLiabilities \nLiability is not shared. \nGeneral Partners \nThe general partners are liable as in a general partnership, and they have the same fiduciary duty and \nduty of care as partners in a general partnership. However, see the discussion in Section 13.3.3 \"Limited \nLiability Limited Partnerships\" of the newest type of LP, the limited liability limited partnership (triple \nLP), where the general partner is also afforded limited liability under ULPA-2001. \n \nLimited Partners \nThe limited partners are only liable up to the amount of their capital contribution, provided the surname \nof the limited partner does not appear in the partnership name (unless his name is coincidentally the \nsame as that of one of the general partners whose name does appear) and provided the limited partner \ndoes not participate in control of the firm. See Section 13.4.1 \"Limited Partnerships: Limited Partners’ \nLiability for Managing Limited Partnership\" for a case that highlights liability issues for partners. \n \nWe have been discussing ULPA-1985 here. But in a world of limited liability companies, limited liability \npartnerships, and limited liability limited partnerships, “the control rule has become an anachronism”; \nULPA-2001 “provides a full, status-based liability shield for each limited partner, ‘even if the limited \npartner participates in the management and control of the limited partnership.’ [3] The section thus \neliminates the so-called control rule with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n554 \nlimited partners into parity with LLC members, LLP partners and corporate shareholders.” [4]And as will \nbe noted in Section 13.3.3 \"Limited Liability Limited Partnerships\" under ULPA-2001 the general partner \nis also shielded from liability. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the limited partnership meets a minimum number of criteria related to limited liability, \ncentralized management, duration, and transferability of ownership, it can enjoy the benefits of pass-\nthrough taxation; otherwise it will be taxed as a corporation. Pass-through (“conduit”) taxation is usually \nvery important to partners. \nTermination \nThe limited partnership’s termination involves the same three steps as in a general partnership: (1) \ndissolution, (2) winding up, and (3) termination. \n \nDissolution \nDissolution of a limited partnership is the first step toward termination (but termination does not \nnecessarily follow dissolution). The limited partners have no power to dissolve the firm except on court \norder, and the death or bankruptcy of a limited partner does not dissolve the firm. The following events \nmay cause dissolution: (1) termination of the partnership as per the certificate’s provisions; (2)",

Contributions may be in the form of cash, property or services rendered, or a promise \nto render them in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nThe LLC operating agreement may provide for either a member-managed LLC or a manager-managed \n(centralized) LLC. If the former, all members have actual and apparent authority to bind the LLC to \ncontracts on its behalf, as in a partnership, and all members’ votes have equal weight unless otherwise \nagreed. Member-managers have duty of care and a fiduciary duty, though the parameters of those duties \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n559 \nvary from state to state. If the firm is manager managed, only managers have authority to bind the firm; \nthe managers have the duty of care and fiduciary duty, but the nonmanager members usually do not. \nSome states’ statutes provide that voting is based on the financial interests of the members. Most statutes \nprovide that any extraordinary firm decisions be voted on by all members (e.g., amend the agreement, \nadmit new members, sell all the assets prior to dissolution, merge with another entity). Members can \nmake their own rules without the structural requirements (e.g., voting rights, notice, quorum, approval of \nmajor decisions) imposed under state corporate law. \n \nIf the firm has a centralized manager system, it gets a check in its “corporate-like” box, so it will need to \nmake sure there are enough noncorporate-like attributes to make up for this one. If it looks too much like \na corporation, it will be taxed like one. \n \nOne of the real benefits of the LLC as compared with the corporation is that no annual meetings are \nrequired, and no minutes need to be kept. Often, owners of small corporations ignore these formalities to \ntheir peril, but with the LLC there are no worries about such record keeping. \n \nCompensation \nDistributions are allocated among members of an LLC according to the operating agreement; managing \npartners may be paid for their services. Absent an agreement, distributions are allocated among members \nin proportion to the values of contributions made by them or required to be made by them. Upon a \nmember’s dissociation that does not cause dissolution, a dissociating member has the right to distribution \nas provided in the agreement, or—if no agreement—the right to receive the fair value of the member’s \ninterest within a reasonable time after dissociation. No distributions are allowed if making them would \ncause the LLC to become insolvent. \n \nLiability \nThe great accomplishment of the LLC is, again, to achieve limited liability for all its members: no general \npartner hangs out with liability exposure. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n560 \nLiability to Outsiders \nMembers are not liable to third parties for contracts made by the firm or for torts committed in the scope \nof business (but of course a person is always liable for her own torts), regardless of the owner’s level of \nparticipation—unlike a limited partnership, where the general partner is liable. Third parties’ only \nrecourse is as against the firm’s property. See Puleo v. Topel, (see Section 13.4.2 \"Liability Issues in \nLLCs\"), for an analysis of owner liability in an LLC. \n \nInternal Liabilities \nUnless the operating agreement provides otherwise, members and managers of the LLC are generally not \nliable to the firm or its members except for acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, intentional \nmisconduct, or knowing violations of the law. Members and managers, though, must account to the firm \nfor any personal profit or benefit derived from activities not consented to by a majority of disinterested \nmembers or managers from the conduct of the firm’s business or member’s or managers use of firm \nproperty—which is the same as in partnership law. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the LLC is properly formed so that it is not too much like a corporation, it will—upon its \nmembers’ election—be treated like a partnership for tax purposes. \n \nTermination \nTermination, loosely speaking, refers either to how the entity’s life as a business ends (continuity of life) \nor to how a member’s interest in the firm ends—that is, how freely the interest is transferable. \n \nContinuity of Life \nThe first step in the termination of the LLC is dissolution, though dissolution is not necessarily followed \nby termination. \n \nDissolution and Winding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n561 \nThe IRS has determined that continuity of life does not exist “if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, \nretirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization,” [1] and \nthat if one of these events occurs, the entity may continue only with the members’ unanimous consent.",

And by this means the firm does not have continuity of life. Some states provide \nopportunities for even more flexibility regarding the “unanimous” part. In the mid-1990s, the IRS issued \nrevenue rulings (as opposed to regulations) that it would be enough if a “majority in interest” of \nremaining partners agreed to continue the business, and the “flexible” statute states adopted this \npossibility (the ones that did not are called “bulletproof” statutes). “Majority in interests” means a \nmajority of profits and capital. \n \nIf the firm does dissolve, some states require public filings to that effect. If dissolution leads to winding \nup, things progress as in a general partnership: the business at hand is finished, accounts are rendered, \nbills paid, assets liquidated, and remaining assets are distributed to creditors (including member and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n562 \nmanager creditors, but not for their shares in profits); to members and past members for unpaid \ndistributions; to members for capital contributions; and to members as agreed or in proportion to \ncontributions made. Upon dissolution, actual authority of members or managers terminates except as \nneeded to wind up; members may have apparent authority, though, unless the third party had notice of \nthe dissolution. \n \nFree Transferability of Interest \nAgain, the problem here is that if a member’s interest in the LLC is as freely transferable as a \nshareholder’s interest in a corporation (an owner can transfer all attributes of his interest without the \nothers’ consent), the LLC will probably be said to have a check mark in the “corporate-like” box: too many \nof those and the firm will not be allowed pass-through taxation. Thus the trick for the LLC promoters is to \nlimit free transferability enough to pass the test of not being a corporation, but not limit so much as to \nmake it really difficult to divest oneself of the interest (then it’s not a very liquid or desirable investment). \n \nSome states’ LLC statutes have as the default rule that the remaining members must unanimously consent \nto allow an assignee or a transferee of a membership interest to participate in managing the LLC. Since \nthis prevents a member from transferring all attributes of the interest (the right to participate in \nmanagement isn’t transferred or assigned), the LLC formed under the default provision will not have “free \ntransferability of interest.” But if the LLC agreement allows majority consent for the transfer of all \nattributes, that also would satisfy the requirement that there not be free transferability of interests. Then \nwe get into the question of how to define “majority”: by number of members or by value of their \nmembership? And what if only the managing partners need to consent? Or if there are two classes of \nmembership and the transfer of interests in one class requires the consent of the other? The point is that \npeople keep pushing the boundaries to see how close their LLC can come to corporation-like status \nwithout being called a corporation.",

[2] (Here we see an example of the legislature allowing \nbusiness owners to externalize the risks of business operation.) More broadly, the success of the limited \nliability company attracted the attention of professionals like accountants, lawyers, and doctors who \nsought insulation from personal liability for the mistakes or malpractice of their partners. Their wish was \ngranted with the adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the limited liability \npartnership in the early 1990s. Most partnership law under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act applies \nto LLPs. \n \nCreation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n566 \nMembers of a partnership (only a majority is required) who want to form an LLP must file with the \nsecretary of state; the name of the firm must include “limited liability partnership” or “LLP” to notify the \npublic that its members will not stand personally for the firm’s liabilities. \n \nLiability \nAs noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to afford insulation from liability for its members. A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed limited liability for negligent acts and retained \nunlimited liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts by partners, \nemployees, or agents. The second wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability, leaving only \nbreaches of ordinary contract obligation. These two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. \nThe third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection—no unlimited liability at all. Needless to \nsay, the full-shield type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still, however, many statutes \nrequire specified amounts of professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain fully liable for their \nown negligence or for wrongful acts of those in the LLP whom they supervise. \n \nIn other respects, the LLP is like a partnership. \n \n \nLimited Liability Limited Partnerships \nThe progress toward achieving limited liability continues. A \nlimited liability limited partnership (LLLP, or triple LP) is the latest invention. It is a limited \npartnership that has invoked the LLLP provisions of its state partnership law by filing with a specified \npublic official the appropriate documentation to become an LLLP. This form completely eliminates the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n567 \nautomatic personal liability of the general partner for partnership obligations and, under most statutes, \nalso eliminates the “control rule” liability exposure for all limited partners. It is noteworthy that California \nlaw does not allow for an LLLP to be formed in California; however, it does recognize LLLPs formed in \nother states. A “foreign” LLLP doing business in California must register with the secretary of state. As of \nFebruary 2011, twenty-one states allow the formation of LLLPs. \n \nThe 2001 revision of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) provides this definition of an LLLP: \n“‘Limited liability limited partnership’…means a limited partnership whose certificate of limited \npartnership states that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.” [4] Section 404(c) \ngets to the point: “An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a \nlimited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation \nof the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5]",

Commercial breached \nthe contract, and Plaintiff brought suit against Union Properties and Defendants. The trial court \nconcluded that Defendants did not incur general liability for Commercial’s obligations by reason of their \ncontrol of Commercial, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. \n \n[Plaintiff] does not contend that Defendants acted improperly by setting up the limited partnership with a \ncorporation as the sole general partner. Limited partnerships are a statutory form of business \norganization, and parties creating a limited partnership must follow the statutory requirements. In \nWashington, parties may form a limited partnership with a corporation as the sole general partner. \n[Citations] \n \nPlaintiff’s sole contention is that Defendants should incur general liability for the limited partnership’s \nobligations under RCW 25.08.070, because they exercised the day-to-day control and management of \nCommercial. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Commercial was controlled by Union Properties, a \nseparate legal entity, and not by Defendants in their individual capacities. [RCW 25.08.070 then read: “A \nlimited partner shall not become liable as a general partner unless, in addition to the exercise of his rights \nand powers as limited partner, he takes part in the control of the business.”] \n \n…The pattern of operation of Union Properties was to investigate and conceive of real estate investment \nopportunities and, when it found such opportunities, to cause the creation of limited partnerships with \nUnion Properties acting as the general partner. Commercial was only one of several limited partnerships \nso conceived and created. Defendants did not form Union Properties for the sole purpose of operating \nCommercial. Hence, their acts on behalf of Union Properties were not performed merely for the benefit of \nCommercial.… \n \n[P]etitioner was never led to believe that Defendants were acting in any capacity other than in their \ncorporate capacities. The parties stipulated at the trial that Defendants never acted in any direct, personal \ncapacity. When the shareholders of a corporation, who are also the corporation’s officers and directors, \nconscientiously keep the affairs of the corporation separate from their personal affairs, and no fraud or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n571 \nmanifest injustice is perpetrated upon third persons who deal with the corporation, the corporation’s \nseparate entity should be respected. [Citations] \n \nFor us to find that Defendants incurred general liability for the limited partnership’s obligations under \nRCW 25.08.070 would require us to apply a literal interpretation of the statute and totally ignore the \ncorporate entity of Union Properties, when Plaintiff knew it was dealing with that corporate entity. There \ncan be no doubt that Defendants, in fact, controlled the corporation. However, they did so only in their \ncapacities as agents for their principal, the corporate general partner. Although the corporation was a \nseparate entity, it could act only through its board of directors, officers, and agents. [Citations] Plaintiff \nentered into the contract with Commercial. Defendants signed the contract in their capacities as president \nand secretary-treasurer of Union Properties, the general partner of Commercial. In the eyes of the law it \nwas Union Properties, as a separate corporate entity, which entered into the contract with Plaintiff and \ncontrolled the limited partnership. \nFurther, because Defendants scrupulously separated their actions on behalf of the corporation from their \npersonal actions, Plaintiff never mistakenly assumed that Defendants were general partners with general \nliability.

Relying on [Citation], plaintiffs contended that Topel, as a principal of \nThinktank, an LLC, had a legal status similar to a shareholder or director of a corporation, who courts \nhave found liable for a dissolved corporation’s debts. Thus, plaintiffs argued that Topel was personally \nliable for Thinktank’s debts.… \n…The circuit court denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment against Topel.…In doing so, the \ncircuit court acknowledged that Topel continued to do business as Thinktank after its dissolution and that \nthe contractual obligations at issue were incurred after the dissolution. \n \nHowever…the court entered a final order dismissing all of plaintiffs’ claims against Topel with \nprejudice.…The court stated in pertinent part: \n \nBased upon the Court’s…finding that the Illinois Legislature did not intend to hold a member of a \nLimited Liability Company liable for debts incurred after the Limited Liability Company had \nbeen involuntarily dissolved, the Court finds that all of Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Topel \nwithin the Complaint fail as a matter of law, as they are premised upon Defendant Topel’s alleged \npersonal liability for obligations incurred in the name of Thinktank LLC after it had been \ninvoluntarily dissolved by the Illinois Secretary of State.",

            "chunk": "corporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total",

Define the two types of business corporations. \n \n \n \nNonprofit Corporations \nOne of the four major classifications of corporations is the nonprofit corporation (also called not-for-\nprofit corporation). It is defined in the American Bar Association’s Model Non-Profit Corporation Act as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n599 \n“a corporation no part of the income of which is distributable to its members, directors or officers.” \nNonprofit corporations may be formed under this law for charitable, educational, civil, religious, social, \nand cultural purposes, among others. \n \nPublic Corporations \nThe true public corporation is a governmental entity. It is often called a municipal corporation, to \ndistinguish it from the publicly held corporation, which is sometimes also referred to as a “public” \ncorporation, although it is in fact private (i.e., it is not governmental). Major cities and counties, and many \ntowns, villages, and special governmental units, such as sewer, transportation, and public utility \nauthorities, are incorporated. These corporations are not organized for profit, do not have shareholders, \nand operate under different statutes than do business corporations. \n \nProfessional Corporations \nUntil the 1960s, lawyers, doctors, accountants, and other professionals could not practice their \nprofessions in corporate form. This inability, based on a fear of professionals’ being subject to the \ndirection of the corporate owners, was financially disadvantageous. Under the federal income tax laws \nthen in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During \nthe 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax \nbenefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a professional corporation just as it would \nany other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of \ntax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension. That decision led to a burgeoning number of \nprofessional corporations. \n \n \n \nBusiness Corporations \nThe Two Types \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n600 \nIt is the business corporation proper that we focus on in this unit.

The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware.

Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business.",

Although compliance with these requirements is largely a matter of filling in the blanks, two \npoints deserve mention. \n \nFirst, the choice of a name is often critical to the business. Under RMBCA, Section 4.01, the name must \ninclude one of the following words (or abbreviations): corporation, company, incorporated, or limited \n(Corp., Co., Inc., or Ltd.). The name is not allowed to deceive the public about the corporation’s purposes, \nnor may it be the same as that of any other company incorporated or authorized to do business in the \nstate. \n \nThese legal requirements are obvious; the business requirements are much harder. If the name is not \ndescriptive of the business or does not anticipate changes in the business, it may have to be changed, and \nthe change can be expensive. For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes. Section 3.01 of the RMBCA goes one step further in providing that a corporation \nautomatically “has the purpose of engaging in any lawful business” unless the articles specify a more \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n607 \nlimited purpose. Once completed, the articles of incorporation are delivered to the secretary of state for \nfiling. The existence of a corporation begins once the articles have been filed. \n \nOrganizational Meeting of Directors \nThe first order of business, once the certificate of incorporation is issued, is a meeting of the board of \ndirectors named in the articles of incorporation. They must adopt bylaws, elect officers, and transact any \nother business that may come before the meeting (RMBCA, Section 2.05). Other business would include \naccepting (ratifying) promoters’ contracts, calling for the payment of stock subscriptions, and adopting \nbank resolution forms, giving authority to various officers to sign checks drawn on the corporation. \nSection 10.20 of the RMBCA vests in the directors the power to alter, amend, or repeal the bylaws adopted \nat the initial meeting, subject to repeal or change by the shareholders. The articles of incorporation may \nreserve the power to modify or repeal exclusively to the shareholders. The bylaws may contain any \nprovisions that do not conflict with the articles of incorporation or the law of the state. \n \nTypical provisions in the bylaws include fixing the place and time at which annual stockholders’ meetings \nwill be held, fixing a quorum, setting the method of voting, establishing the method of choosing directors, \ncreating committees of directors, setting down the method by which board meetings may be called and \nthe voting procedures to be followed, determining the offices to be filled by the directors and the powers \nwith which each officer shall be vested, fixing the method of declaring dividends, establishing a fiscal year, \nsetting out rules governing issuance and transfer of stock, and establishing the method of amending the \nbylaws. \n \nSection 2.07 of the RMBCA provides that the directors may adopt bylaws that will operate during an \nemergency. An emergency is a situation in which “a quorum of the corporation’s directors cannot readily \nbe assembled because of some catastrophic event.” \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n608",

Graziano \n355 A.2d. 830 (1976) \n \nEAGEN, JUSTICE. \n \nOn April 30, 1970, RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. [RKO], as seller, entered into an agreement of sale \nwith Jack Jenofsky and Ralph Graziano, as purchasers. This agreement contemplated the sale of the Kent \nTheatre, a parcel of improved commercial real estate located at Cumberland and Kensington Avenues in \nPhiladelphia, for a total purchase price of $70,000. Settlement was originally scheduled for September \n30, 1970, and, at the request of Jenofsky and Graziano, continued twice, first to October 16, 1970, and \nthen to October 21, 1970. However, Jenofsky and Graziano failed to complete settlement on the last \nscheduled date. \n \nSubsequently, on November 13, 1970, RKO filed a complaint in equity seeking judicial enforcement of the \nagreement of sale. Although Jenofsky, in his answer to the complaint, denied personal liability for the \nperformance of the agreement, the chancellor, after a hearing, entered a decree nisi granting the \nrequested relief sought by RKO.…This appeal ensued. \nAt the time of the execution of this agreement, Jenofsky and Graziano were engaged in promoting the \nformation of a corporation to be known as Kent Enterprises, Inc. Reflecting these efforts, Paragraph 19 of \nthe agreement, added by counsel for Jenofsky and Graziano, recited: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n619 \nIt is understood by the parties hereto that it is the intention of the Purchaser to incorporate. Upon \ncondition that such incorporation be completed by closing, all agreements, covenants, and warranties \ncontained herein shall be construed to have been made between Seller and the resultant corporation and \nall documents shall reflect same. \n \nIn fact, Jenofsky and Graziano did file Articles of Incorporation for Kent Enterprises, Inc., with the State \nCorporation Bureau on October 9, 1971, twelve days prior to the scheduled settlement date. Jenofsky now \ncontends the inclusion of Paragraph 19 in the agreement and the subsequent filing of incorporation \npapers, released him from any personal liability resulting from the non-performance of the agreement. \n \nThe legal relationship of Jenofsky to Kent Enterprises, Inc., at the date of the execution of the agreement \nof sale was that of promoter. As such, he is subject to the general rule that a promoter, although he may \nassume to act on behalf of a projected corporation and not for himself, will be held personally liable on \ncontracts made by him for the benefit of a corporation he intends to organize. This personal liability will \ncontinue even after the contemplated corporation is formed and has received the benefits of the contract, \nunless there is a novation or other agreement to release liability. \n \nThe imposition of personal liability upon a promoter where that promoter has contracted on behalf of a \ncorporation is based upon the principle that one who assumes to act for a nonexistent principal is himself \nliable on the contract in the absence of an agreement to the contrary. \n \n[T]here [are] three possible understandings that parties may have when an agreement is executed by a \npromoter on behalf of a proposed corporation: \nWhen a party is acting for a proposed corporation, he cannot, of course, bind it by anything he does, at the \ntime, but he may (1) take on its behalf an offer from the other which, being accepted after the formation of \nthe company, becomes a contract; (2) make a contract at the time binding himself, with the stipulation or \nunderstanding, that if a company is formed it will take his place and that then he shall be relieved of \nresponsibility; or (3) bind himself personally without more and look to the proposed company, when \nformed, for indemnity. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n620 \n \nBoth RKO and Jenofsky concede the applicability of alternative No. 2 to the instant case. That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed,",

Describe treasury stock, and explain its function. \n6. Analyze whether debt or equity is a better financing option. \n \n \nStocks, or shares, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Traditionally, stock was the original \ncapital paid into a business by its founders. This stock was then divided into shares, or fractional \nownership of the stock. In modern usage, the two terms are used interchangeably, as we will do here. \nShares in closely held corporations are often identical: each share of stock in BCT Bookstore, Inc. carries \nwith it the same right to vote, to receive dividends, and to receive a distribution of the net assets of the \ncompany upon liquidation. Many large corporations do not present so simple a picture. Large \ncorporations may have many different types of stock: different classes of common stock, preferred stock, \nstock with par value and no-par stock, voting and nonvoting stock, outstanding stock, and treasury stock. \nTo find out which types of stock a company has issued, look at the shareholders’ (or stockholders’) equity \nsection of the company’s balance sheet. \n \nAuthorized, Issued, and Outstanding Stock \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n637 \nStocks have different designations depending on who holds them. The articles of incorporation spell out \nhow many shares of stock the corporation may issue: these are its authorized shares. The corporation \nis not obliged to issue all authorized shares, but it may not issue more than the total without amending the \narticles of incorporation. The total of stock sold to investors is the issued stock of the corporation; the \nissued stock in the hands of all shareholders is called outstanding stock. \n \nPar Value and No-Par Stock \nPar value is the face value of stock. Par value, though, is not the market value; it is a value placed on the \nstock by the corporation but has little to do with the buying and selling value of that stock on the open \nmarket. \n \nWhen a value is specified on a stock certificate, it is said to be par value. Par value is established in the \narticles of incorporation and is the floor price of the stock; the corporation may not accept less than par \nvalue for the stock. \n \nCompanies in most states can also issue no-par shares. No-par stock may be sold for whatever price is set \nby the board of directors or by the market—unless the shareholders themselves are empowered to \nestablish the price. But many states permit (and some states require) no-par stock to have a stated value. \nCorporations issue no-par stock to reduce their exposure to liability: if the par value is greater than the \nmarket value, the corporation may be liable for that difference. \n \nOnce the universal practice, issuance of par value common stock is now limited. However, preferred stock \nusually has a par value, which is useful in determining dividend and liquidation rights. \n \nThe term stated capital describes the sum of the par value of the issued par value stock and the \nconsideration received (or stated value) for the no-par stock. The excess of net assets of a corporation over \nstated capital is its surplus. Surplus is divided into earned surplus (essentially the company’s retained \nearnings) and capital surplus (all surpluses other than earned surplus). We will return to these concepts in \nour discussion of dividends. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n638 \n \nPreferred Stock \nThe term preferred has no set legal meaning, but shareholders of preferred stock often have different \nrights than shareholders of common stock.

We will return to these concepts in \nour discussion of dividends. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n638 \n \nPreferred Stock \nThe term preferred has no set legal meaning, but shareholders of preferred stock often have different \nrights than shareholders of common stock. Holders of preferred stock must look to the articles of \nincorporation to find out what their rights are. Preferred stock has elements of both stock (equity) and \nbonds (debt). Thus corporations issue preferred stock to attract more conservative investors: common \nstock is riskier than preferred stock, so corporations can attract more investors if they have both preferred \nand common stock. \n \nPreference to Dividends \nA dividend is a payment made to stockholders from corporate profits. Assume that one class of preferred \nstock is entitled to a 7 percent dividend. The percentage applies to the par value; if par value is $100, each \nshare of preferred is entitled to a dividend of $7 per year. Assuming the articles of incorporation say so, \nthis 7 percent preferred stock has preference over other classes of shares for dividend payments. \n \nLiquidation Preference \nAn additional right of preferred shareholders is the right to share in the distribution of assets in the event \nof liquidation, after having received assets under a liquidation preference—that is, a preference, according \nto a predetermined formula, to receive the assets of the company on liquidation ahead of other classes of \nshareholders. \n \nConvertible Shares \nWith one exception, the articles of incorporation may grant the right to convert any class of stock into any \nother at the holder’s option according to a fixed ratio. Alternatively, the corporation may force a \nconversion of a shareholder’s convertible stock. Thus if permitted, a preferred shareholder may convert \nhis or her preferred shares into common stock, or vice versa. The exception bars conversion of stock into a \nclass with an asset liquidation preference, although some states permit even that type of so-called \nupstream conversion to a senior security. Convertible preferred shares can be used as a poison pill (a \ncorporate strategy to avoid a hostile takeover): when an outsider seeks to gain control, convertible \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n639 \nshareholders may elect to convert their preferred shares into common stock, thus increasing the number \nof common shares and increasing the number of shares the outsider must purchase in order to gain \ncontrol. \n \nRedeemable Shares \nThe articles of incorporation may provide for the redemption of shares, unless in doing so the corporation \nwould become insolvent. Redemption may be either at an established price and time or by election of the \ncorporation or the shareholder. Redeemed stock is called cancelled stock. Unless the articles of \nincorporation prohibit it, the shares are considered authorized but unissued and can be reissued as the \nneed arises. If the articles of incorporation specifically make the cancellation permanent, then the total \nnumber of authorized shares is reduced, and new shares cannot be reissued without amending the articles \nof incorporation. In this case, the redeemed shares cannot be reissued and must be marked as cancelled \nstock. \n \nVoting Rights \nOrdinarily, the articles of incorporation provide that holders of preferred shares do not have a voting \nright. Or they may provide for contingent voting rights, entitling preferred shareholders to vote on the \nhappening of a particular event—for example, the nonpayment of a certain number of dividends. The \narticles may allow class voting for directors, to ensure that the class of preferred stockholders has some \nrepresentation on the board. \n \nCommon Stock \nCommon stock is different from preferred stock. Common stock represents an ownership interest in a \ncorporation. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, common stockholders have the \nfollowing rights: \n1. Voting rights. This is a key difference: preferred shareholders usually do not have the right to vote. \nCommon shareholders express their ownership interest in the corporation by voting. Votes are cast at \nmeetings, typically the annual meetings, and the shareholders can vote for directors and on other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n640 \nimportant corporate decisions (e.g., there has been a recent push to allow shareholders to vote on \nexecutive compensation). \n2. The right to ratable participation in earnings (i.e., in proportion to the total shares) and/or the right to \nratable participation in the distribution of net assets on liquidation. Bondholders and other creditors \nhave seniority upon liquidation, but if they have been satisfied, or the corporation has no debt, the \ncommon shareholders may ratably recover from what is left over in liquidation.",

The right to ratable participation in earnings (i.e., in proportion to the total shares) and/or the right to \nratable participation in the distribution of net assets on liquidation. Bondholders and other creditors \nhave seniority upon liquidation, but if they have been satisfied, or the corporation has no debt, the \ncommon shareholders may ratably recover from what is left over in liquidation. \n3. Some shares may give holders preemptive rights to purchase additional shares. This right is often \ninvoked in two instances. First, if a corporation is going to issue more shares, a shareholder may invoke \nthis right so that his or her total percentage ownership is not diluted. Second, the right to purchase \nadditional shares can be invoked to prevent a hostile takeover (a poison pill, discussed in Section 15.3.3 \n\"Preferred Stock\"). \n \nCorporations may issue different classes of shares (including both common and preferred stock). This \npermits a corporation to provide different rights to shareholders. For example, one class of common stock \nmay give holders more votes than another class of common stock. Stock is a riskier investment for its \npurchasers compared with bonds and preferred stock. In exchange for this increased risk and junior \ntreatment, common stockholders have the rights noted here. \n \nTreasury Shares \nTreasury shares are those that were originally issued and then reacquired by the company (such as in a \nbuyback, discussed next) or, alternatively, never sold to the public in the first place and simply retained by \nthe corporation. Thus treasury shares are shares held or owned by the corporation. They are considered to \nbe issued shares but not outstanding shares. \n \n \nBuyback \nCorporations often reacquire their shares, for a variety of reasons, in a process sometimes called \na buyback. If the stock price has dropped so far that the shares are worth considerably less than book \nvalue, the corporation might wish to buy its shares to prevent another company from taking it over. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n641 \ncompany might decide that investing in itself is a better strategic decision than making other potential \nexpenditures or investments. And although it is essentially an accounting trick, buybacks improve a \ncompany’s per-share earnings because profits need to be divided into fewer outstanding shares. \n \nBuybacks can also be used to go private. Private equity may play a role in going-private transactions, as \ndiscussed in Section 15.1.5 \"Other Forms of Finance\". The corporation may not have sufficient equity to \nbuy out all its public shareholders and thus will partner with private equity to finance the stock buyback to \ngo private. For example, in early 2011, Playboy Enterprises, Inc., publisher of Playboy magazine, went \nprivate. Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy, teamed up with private equity firm Rizvi Traverse \nManagement to buy back the public shares. Hefner said that the transaction “will give us the resources \nand flexibility to return Playboy to its unique position and to further expand our business around the \nworld.” [1] \n \nCorporations may go private to consolidate control, because of a belief that the shares are undervalued, to \nincrease flexibility, or because of a tender offer or hostile takeover. Alternatively, an outside investor may \nthink that a corporation is not being managed properly and may use a tender offer to buy all the public \nshares. \n \nStocks and Bonds and Bears, Oh My! \nSuppose that BCT Bookstore, Inc. has become a large, well-established corporation after a round of \nprivate equity and bank loans (since repaid) but needs to raise capital. What is the best method? There is \nno one right answer. Much of the decision will depend on the financial and accounting standing of the \ncorporation: if BCT already has a lot of debt, it might be better to issue stock rather than bring on more \ndebt. Alternatively, BCT could wish to remain a privately held corporation, and thus a stock sale would \nnot be considered, as it would dilute the ownership. The economy in general could impact the decision: a \nbear market could push BCT more toward using debt, while a bull market could push BCT more toward an \ninitial public offering (discussed in Section 15.4.1 \"Sale of stock\") or stock sale. Interest rates could be low, \nincreasing the bang-for-the-buck factor of debt. Additionally, public stock sales can be risky for the \ncorporation: the corporation could undervalue its stock in the initial sale, selling the stock for less than \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n642 \nwhat the marketplace thinks it is worth, missing out on additional funds because of this undervaluation.",

            "chunk": "legal services had been thought by the corporation to be worth $6,000 but in fact were worth $1,000, and \nthat he had received stock with par value of $6,000 (i.e., 6,000 shares of $1 par value stock) in exchange \nfor his services. Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value? This is the problem of watered stock: the inflated consideration is in fact less \nthan par value. The term itself comes from the ancient fraud of farmers and ranchers who increased the \nweight of their cattle (also known as stock) by forcing them to ingest excess water. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n646 \nThe majority of states follow the good-faith rule. As noted near the end of the United Steel \nIndustries case, in the absence of fraud, “the judgment of the board of directors ‘as to the value of \nconsideration received for shares’ is conclusive.” In other words, if the directors or shareholders conclude \nin good faith that the consideration does fairly reflect par value, then the stock is not watered and the \nstock buyer cannot be assessed for the difference. This is in line with the business judgment rule, \ndiscussed in Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\". If the directors concluded in good faith \nthat the consideration provided by Griffitts’s services accurately reflected the value of the shares, they \nwould not be liable. The minority approach is the true value rule: the consideration must in fact equal par \nvalue by an objective standard at the time the shares are issued, regardless of the board’s good-faith \njudgment. \n \nA shareholder may commence a derivative lawsuit (a suit by a shareholder, on behalf of the corporation, \noften filed against the corporation; see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"). In a watered \nstock lawsuit, the derivative suit is filed against a shareholder who has failed to pay full consideration \nunder either rule to recover the difference between the value received by the corporation and the par \nvalue. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations may raise funds through the sale of stock. This can be accomplished through an initial public \noffering (IPO)—the first time a corporation sells stock—or through stock sales after an IPO. The SEC is the \nregulatory body that oversees the sale of stock. A sale of stock has several benefits for the corporation, such \nas avoiding the use of debt, which can be much more expensive than selling stock. Stock sales also increase \nthe firm’s exposure and attract investors who prefer more risk than bonds. On the other hand, stock sales \nhave some disadvantages, namely, the dilution of ownership of the corporation. Also, the corporation may \nundervalue its shares, thus missing out on additional capital because of the undervaluation. Being a publicly \ntraded company places the corporation under the extensive requirements of the SEC and the 1933 and 1934 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n647 \nsecurities acts, such as shareholder meetings and annual financial reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act adds yet \nmore requirements that a corporation may wish to avoid. \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. Most investors will exchange money for stock. \nCertain forms of consideration are not permitted. Finally, a corporation may be liable if it sells watered stock, \nwhere consideration received by the corporation is less than the stock par value. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends \nThe law imposes certain limitations on cash or property dividends a corporation may disburse. Dividends \nmay not be paid if (1) the business is insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they become due), (2) \npaying dividends would make it insolvent, or (3) payment would violate a restriction in the articles of \nincorporation. Most states also restrict the funds available for distribution to those available in earned \nsurplus. Under this rule, a corporation that ran a deficit in the current year could still declare a dividend \nas long as the total earned surplus offset the deficit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n650 \nA few states—significantly, Delaware is one of them—permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current \nearnings and those of the immediately preceding year, both years taken as a single period, even if the \nbalance sheet shows a negative earned surplus. Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified",

[2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent. It may revoke a share \ndividend as long as the shares have not been issued. \n \nDiscretion of Directors to Pay Dividends \nWhen Directors Are Too Stingy \nIn every state, dividends are normally payable only at the discretion of the directors. Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders. A corporation may pay dividends \nthrough a variety of methods, although money and additional shares are the most common. Corporations may \nincrease or decrease the total number of shares through either a stock split or a reverse stock split. A \ncorporation may decide to pay dividends but is not required to do so and cannot issue dividends if the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n652 \ncorporation is insolvent.

Know the modern changes to corporate finance terminology and specific requirements imposed by states. \n2. Compare the application of the Uniform Commercial Code to corporate finance with the applicability of the \n1933 and 1934 federal securities acts. \n \n \nChanges in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n653 \nPerhaps the most dramatic innovations incorporated into the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \n(RMBCA) are the financial provisions. The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation. [1] \n \nTherefore, although the modern trend is to move away from par value as well as some other previously \ndiscussed terms—and despite the RMBCA’s abandonment of these concepts—they still, in large measure, \npersist. \n \nIntroduction to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n654 \nPartial ownership of a corporation would be an awkward investment if there were no ready means of \ntransfer. The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the",

His testimony creates the impression, also, that he thinks the \nFord Motor Company has made too much money, has had too large profits, and that although large profits \nmight be still earned, a sharing of them with the public, by reducing the price of the output of the \ncompany, ought to be undertaken.

In Chapter 17 \"Securities \nRegulation\", we will continue discussion of officers’ and directors’ liability within the context of \nsecurities regulation and insider trading. \n \n \n \n16.1 Powers of a Corporation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the two types of corporate power. \n2. Consider the ramifications when a corporation acts outside its prescribed powers. \n3. Review legal issues surrounding corporate actions. \n \n \n \nTwo Types of Corporate Powers \nA corporation generally has three parties sharing power and control: directors, officers, and shareholders. \nDirectors are the managers of the corporation, and officers control the day-to-day decisions and work \nmore closely with the employees. The shareholders are the owners of the corporation, but they have little \ndecision-making authority. The corporation itself has powers; while a corporation is not the same as a \nperson (e.g., a corporation cannot be put in prison), it is allowed to conduct certain activities and has been \ngranted certain rights. \n \nExpress Powers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n668 \nThe corporation may exercise all powers expressly given it by statute and by its articles of incorporation. \nSection 3.02 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) sets out a number \nof express powers, including the following: to sue and be sued in the corporate name; to purchase, use, \nand sell land and dispose of assets to the same extent a natural person can; to make contracts, borrow \nmoney, issue notes and bonds, lend money, invest funds, make donations to the public welfare, and \nestablish pension plans; and to join in partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, or other enterprises. The \npowers set out in this section need not be included in the articles of incorporation. \n \nImplied Powers \nCorporate powers beyond those explicitly established are implied powers. For example, suppose BCT \nBookstore, Inc.’s statement of purpose reads simply, “to operate a bookstore.” The company may lawfully \nconduct all acts that are necessary or appropriate to running a bookstore—hiring employees, advertising \nspecial sales, leasing trucks, and so forth. Could Ted, its vice president and general manager, authorize the \nexpenditure of funds to pay for a Sunday afternoon lecture on the perils of nuclear war or the adventures \nof a professional football player? Yes—if the lectures are relevant to current books on sale or serve to bring \npeople into the store, they comply with the corporation’s purpose. \n \n \nThe Ultra Vires Doctrine \nThe law places limitations upon what acts a corporation may undertake. Corporations cannot do anything \nthey wish, but rather, must act within the prescribed rules as laid out in statute, case law, their articles of \nincorporation, and their bylaws. Sometimes, though, a corporation will step outside its permitted power \n(literally “beyond the powers). The ultra vires doctrine holds that certain legal consequences attach to \nan attempt by a corporation to carry out acts that are outside its lawful powers. Ultra vires (literally \n“beyond the powers”) is not limited to illegal acts, although it encompasses actions barred by statute as \nwell as by the corporate charter. Under the traditional approach, either the corporation or the other party \ncould assert ultra vires as a defense when refusing to abide by a wholly executory contract. The ultra vires \ndoctrine loses much of its significance when corporate powers are broadly stated in a corporation’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n669 \narticles. Furthermore, RMBCA Section 3.04 states that “the validity of corporate action may not be \nchallenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.” \n \nNonetheless, ultra vires acts are still challenged in courts today. For example, particularly in the area of \nenvironmental law, plaintiffs are challenging corporate environmental actions as ultra vires. Delaware \ncorporation law states that the attorney general shall revoke the charter of a corporation for illegal acts. \nAdditionally, the Court of Chancery of Delaware has jurisdiction to forfeit or revoke a corporate charter \nfor abuse of corporate powers. [1] See Adam Sulkowski’s “Ultra Vires Statutes: Alive, Kicking, and a Means \nof Circumventing the Scalia Standing Gauntlet.” [2] \n \nIn essence, ultra vires retains force in three circumstances: \n \n1. Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3. The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670",

What \nhappens if this action is ultra vires? Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. (see Section 16.5.1 \"Ultra Vires \nActs\"), focuses on this issue. An ultra vires act is not necessarily criminal or tortious. However, every \ncrime and tort is in some sense ultra vires because a corporation never has legal authority to commit \ncrimes or torts. They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent. An additional dilemma was that society could not \nliterally imprison a corporation. Modern law is not so constricting. Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions. But these \ncases are extremely rare. \n \nThat a corporation is found guilty of a violation of the law does not excuse company officials who \nauthorized or carried out the illegal act. They, too, can be prosecuted and sent to jail. Legal punishments \nare being routinely added to the newer regulatory statutes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and the Toxic Substances Control Act—although prosecution depends mainly on whether and where a \nparticular administration wishes to spend its enforcement dollars. Additionally, state prosecuting \nattorneys have become more active in filing criminal charges against management when employees are \ninjured or die on the job. For instance, a trial court judge in Chicago sentenced a company president, \nplant manager, and foreman to twenty-five years in prison after they were convicted of murder following \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n671 \nthe death of a worker as a result of unsafe working conditions at a plant; [3] the punishments were later \noverturned, but the three pled guilty several years later and served shorter sentences of varying duration. \n \nMore recently, prosecutors have been expanding their prosecutions of corporations and developing \nmethodologies to evaluate whether a corporation has committed a criminal act; for example, US Deputy \nAttorney General Paul McNulty revised “Principles of Federal Prosecutions of Business Organizations” in \n2006 to further guide prosecutors in indicting corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\"). [4] This stands in contrast to the general rule that an individual must \nknow, or should know, of a violation of the law in order to be liable. Strict liability does not require",

This option is obviously \nuseful to the closely held corporation but not to the giant publicly held companies. \n \nRight to Vote \nWho Has the Right to Vote? \nThrough its bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors, a corporation can set a “record date.” Only \nthe shareholders listed on the corporate records on that date receive notice of the next shareholders’ \nmeeting and have the right to vote.

For \ninstance, a company might decide to issue both voting and nonvoting shares (as we discussed in Chapter \n16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"), with the voting shares going to insiders who thereby control \nthe corporation. In response to these new corporate structures, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) adopted a one-share, one-vote rule in 1988 that was designed to protect a shareholder’s right to \nvote. In 1990, however, a federal appeals court overturned the SEC rule on the grounds that voting rights \nare governed by state law rather than by federal law. [1] \n \nQuorum \nWhen the articles of incorporation are silent, a shareholder quorum is a simple majority of the shares \nentitled to vote, whether represented in person or by proxy, according to RMBCA Section 7.25. Thus if \nthere are 1 million shares, 500,001 must be represented at the shareholder meeting. A simple majority of \nthose represented shares is sufficient to carry any motion, so 250,001 shares are enough to decide upon a \nmatter other than the election of directors (governed by RMBCA, Section 7.28). The articles of \nincorporation may decree a different quorum but not less than one-third of the total shares entitled to \nvote. \n \nCumulative Voting \nCumulative voting means that a shareholder may distribute his total votes in any manner that he \nchooses—all for one candidate or several shares for different candidates. With cumulative voting, each \nshareholder has a total number of votes equal to the number of shares he owns multiplied by the number \nof directors to be elected. Thus if a shareholder has 1,000 shares and there are five directors to be elected, \nthe shareholder has 5,000 votes, and he may vote those shares in a manner he desires (all for one \ndirector, or 2,500 each for two directors, etc.).

Without cumulative \nvoting, Ted’s slate of directors would win: under statutory voting, each share represents one vote available \nfor each director position. With this method, by placing as many votes as possible for each director, Ted \ncould cast 6,000 votes for each of his desired directors.

            "chunk": "Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) impose on him a stringent duty of disclosure. In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the \ncorporation. The rule encompasses the chance of acquiring another corporation, purchasing property, and \nlicensing or marketing patents or products. This duty of disclosure was placed into legal lexicon by Judge \nCardozo in 1928 when he stated that business partners owe more than a general sense of honor among \none another; rather, they owe “the punctilio of honor most sensitive.” [3] Thus when a corporate \nopportunity arises, business partners must disclose the opportunity, and a failure to disclose is \ndishonest—a breach of the duty of loyalty. \n \nWhether a particular opportunity is a corporate opportunity can be a delicate question. For example, BCT \nowns a golf course and a country club. A parcel of land adjacent to their course comes on the market for \nsale, but BCT takes no action. Two BCT officers purchase the land personally, later informing the BCT \nboard about the purchase and receiving board ratification of their purchase. Then BCT decides to \nliquidate and enters into an agreement with the two officers to sell both parcels of land. A BCT \nshareholder brings a derivative suit against the officers, alleging that purchasing the adjacent land stole a \ncorporate opportunity. The shareholder would be successful in his suit. In considering Farber v. Servan \nLand Co., Inc., [4] a case just like the one described, the Farber court laid out four factors in considering \nwhether a corporate opportunity has been usurped: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n687 \n1. Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand. Put another way, a director must make a reasonable \neffort to inform himself before making a decision, as discussed in the next paragraph. The director is not \nheld to a higher standard required of a specialist (finance, marketing) unless he is one. A director of a \nsmall, closely held corporation will not necessarily be held to the same standard as a director who is given \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n688 \na staff by a large, complex, diversified company. The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations",

What kind of care would an ordinarily prudent person in any situation be required \nto give? Unlike the standard of care, which can differ, the care itself has certain requirements. At a \nminimum, the director must pay attention. He must attend meetings, receive and digest information \nadequate to inform him about matters requiring board action, and monitor the performance of those to \nwhom he has delegated the task of operating the corporation. Of course, documents can be misleading, \nreports can be slanted, and information coming from self-interested management can be distorted. To \nwhat heights must suspicion be raised? Section 8.30 of the RMBCA forgives directors the necessity of \nplaying detective whenever information, including financial data, is received in an apparently reliable \nmanner from corporate officers or employees or from experts such as attorneys and public accountants. \nThus the director does not need to check with another attorney once he has received financial data from \none competent attorney. \n \nA New Jersey Supreme Court decision considered the requirements of fiduciary duties, particularly the \nduty of care. Pritchard & Baird was a reissuance corporation owned by Pritchard and having four \ndirectors: Pritchard, his wife, and his two sons. Pritchard and his sons routinely took loans from the \naccounts of the firm’s clients. After Pritchard died, his sons increased their borrowing, eventually sending \nthe business into bankruptcy. During this time, Mrs. Pritchard developed a fondness for alcohol, drinking \nheavily and paying little attention to her directorship responsibilities. Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation. The court found that Mrs. Pritchard’s being on the board because she \nwas the spouse was insufficient to excuse her behavior, and that had she been performing her duties, she \ncould have prevented the bankruptcy. [6] \n \nDespite the fiduciary requirements, in reality a director does not spend all his time on corporate affairs, is \nnot omnipotent, and must be permitted to rely on the word of others. Nor can directors be infallible in \nmaking decisions. Managers work in a business environment, in which risk is a substantial factor. No \ndecision, no matter how rigorously debated, is guaranteed. Accordingly, courts will not second-guess \ndecisions made on the basis of good-faith judgment and due care. This is the business judgment rule, \nmentioned in previous chapters. The business judgment rule was coming into prominence as early as 1919 \nin Dodge v. Ford, discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". It has been a pillar of \ncorporate law ever since. As described by the Delaware Supreme Court: “The business judgment rule is an \nacknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of Delaware directors.…It is a presumption that in \nmaking a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in \nthe honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” [7] \n \nUnder the business judgment rule, the actions of directors who fulfill their fiduciary duties will not be \nsecond-guessed by a court. The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to",

            "chunk": "these duties are often referred to as the Caremark duties). Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation. Other groups—\nemployees, local communities and neighbors, customers, suppliers, and creditors—took a back seat to this \nprimary responsibility of directors. Of course, directors could consider the welfare of these other groups if \nin so doing they promoted the interests of shareholders. But directors were not legally permitted to favor \nthe interests of others over shareholders. The prevailing rule was, and often still is, that maximizing \nshareholder value is the primary duty of the board. Thus in Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes \nHoldings, Inc., [16] the Delaware Supreme Court held that Revlon’s directors had breached their fiduciary \nduty to the company’s shareholders in response to a hostile tender offer from Pantry Pride. While the facts \nof the case are intricate, the general gist is that the Revlon directors thwarted the hostile tender by \nadopting a variation of a poison pill involving a tender offer for their own shares in exchange for debt, \neffectively eliminating Pantry Pride’s ability to take over the firm. Pantry Pride upped its offer price, and \nin response, Revlon began negotiating with a leveraged buyout by a third party, Forstmann Little. Pantry \nPride publicly announced it would top any bid made by Forstmann Little. Despite this, the Revlon board \nnegotiated a deal with Forstmann Little. The court noted an exception to the general rule that permitted \ndirectors to consider the interests of other groups as long as “there are rationally related benefits accruing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n692 \nto the stockholders.” But when a company is about to be taken over, the object must be to sell it to the \nhighest bidder, Pantry Pride in this case. It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits. This ability has been \nfurther expanding as the concept of corporate social responsibility has grown, as discussed later in this \nsection. \n \nAlthough the other constituency statutes are not identically worded, they are all designed to release \ndirectors from their formal legal obligation to keep paramount the interests of shareholders. The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy. So \nbroadly worded are these laws that although the motive for enacting them was to give directors a weapon \nin fighting hostile tender offers, in some states the principle applies to any decision by a board of \ndirectors. So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies.

While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in \nthe context of mergers, acquisitions, and tender offers. As mentioned previously in the Revlon case, the \nduty owed to shareholders in situations of competing tender offers is that of maximum value. Other duties \nmay arise, such as when directors attempt to retain their positions on the board in the face of a hostile \ntender offer. Trends in fiduciary responsibilities, as well as other changes in the business legal field, are \ncovered extensively by the American Bar Association \nat http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html. \n \nLiability Prevention and Insurance \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n695 \nAlice, the director of BCT, has been charged with breaching her duty of care. Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law.

The duty of \nloyalty is a responsibility to act in the best interest of the corporation, even when that action may conflict with \na personal interest. This duty commonly arises in contracts with the corporation and with corporate \nopportunities. The duty of care requires directors and officers to act with the care of an ordinarily prudent \nperson in like circumstances. The business judgment rule may protect directors and officers, since courts give \na presumption to the corporation that its personnel are informed and act in good faith. A shareholder may file \na derivative lawsuit on behalf of the corporation against corporate insiders for breaches of these fiduciary \nobligations or other actions that harm the corporation. While directors and officers have obligations to the \ncorporation and its shareholders, they may weigh other considerations under constituency statutes. In \nresponse to recent debacles, state and federal laws, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, have placed further \nrequirements on officers and directors. Director and officer expenses in defending claims of wrongful acts may \nbe covered through indemnification or insurance. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n697 \n \n1.

            "chunk": "care and loyalty.…” But, in the pragmatic, conduct-regulating legal realm which calls for more precise \nconceptual line drawing, the answer is that grossly negligent conduct, without more, does not and cannot \nconstitute a breach of the fiduciary duty to act in good faith. The conduct that is the subject of due care \nmay overlap with the conduct that comes within the rubric of good faith in a psychological sense, but from \na legal standpoint those duties are and must remain quite distinct.… \n \nThe Delaware General Assembly has addressed the distinction between bad faith and a failure to exercise \ndue care (i.e., gross negligence) in two separate contexts. The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del. C. § 145. To \noversimplify, subsections (a) and (b) of that statute permit a corporation to indemnify (inter alia) any \nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses…where \n(among other things): (i) that person is, was, or is threatened to be made a party to that action, suit or \nproceeding, and (ii) that person “acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be \nin or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.…” Thus, under Delaware statutory law a \ndirector or officer of a corporation can be indemnified for liability (and litigation expenses) incurred by \nreason of a violation of the duty of care, but not for a violation of the duty to act in good faith. \n \nSection 145, like Section 102(b)(7), evidences the intent of the Delaware General Assembly to afford \nsignificant protections to directors (and, in the case of Section 145, other fiduciaries) of Delaware \ncorporations. To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith. In our view it must be, for at least two reasons. \n \nFirst, the universe of fiduciary misconduct is not limited to either disloyalty in the classic sense (i.e., \npreferring the adverse self-interest of the fiduciary or of a related person to the interest of the \ncorporation) or gross negligence. Cases have arisen where corporate directors have no conflicting self-\ninterest in a decision, yet engage in misconduct that is more culpable than simple inattention or failure to \nbe informed of all facts material to the decision. To protect the interests of the corporation and its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n707 \nshareholders, fiduciary conduct of this kind, which does not involve disloyalty (as traditionally defined) \nbut is qualitatively more culpable than gross negligence, should be proscribed. A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

Shareholders who own voting stock do retain the power to elect \ndirectors, amend the bylaws, ratify or reject certain corporate actions, and vote on certain extraordinary \nmatters, such as whether to amend the articles of incorporation, merge, or liquidate. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n709 \nIn voting for directors, various voting methodologies may be used, such as cumulative voting, which \nprovides safeguards against removal of minority-shareholder-supported directors.

It is an independent regulatory agency, subject to the \nrules of the Administrative Procedure Act (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The commission is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n716 \ncomposed of five members, who have staggered five-year terms. Every June 5, the term of one of the \ncommissioners expires. Although the president cannot remove commissioners during their terms of \noffice, he does have the power to designate the chairman from among the sitting members. The SEC is \nbipartisan: not more than three commissioners may be from the same political party. \n \nThe SEC’s primary task is to investigate complaints or other possible violations of the law in securities \ntransactions and to bring enforcement proceedings when it believes that violations have occurred. It is \nempowered to conduct information inquiries, interview witnesses, examine brokerage records, and review \ntrading data. If its requests are refused, it can issue subpoenas and seek compliance in federal court. Its \nusual leads come from complaints of investors and the general public, but it has authority to conduct \nsurprise inspections of the books and records of brokers and dealers. Another source of leads is price \nfluctuations that seem to have been caused by manipulation rather than regular market forces. \n \nAmong the violations the commission searches out are these: (1) unregistered sale of securities subject to \nthe registration requirement of the Securities Act of 1933, (2) fraudulent acts and practices, (3) \nmanipulation of market prices, (4) carrying out of a securities business while insolvent, (5) \nmisappropriation of customers’ funds by brokers and dealers, and (4) other unfair dealings by brokers \nand dealers. \n \nWhen the commission believes that a violation has occurred, it can take one of three courses. First, it can \nrefer the case to the Justice Department with a recommendation for criminal prosecution in cases of \nfraud or other willful violation of law. \n \nSecond, the SEC can seek a civil injunction in federal court against further violations. As a result of \namendments to the securities laws in 1990 (the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock \nReform Act), the commission can also ask the court to impose civil penalties. The maximum penalty is \n$100,000 for each violation by a natural person and $500,000 for each violation by an entity other than a \nnatural person. Alternatively, the defendant is liable for the gain that resulted from violating securities law \nif the gain exceeds the statutory penalty. The court is also authorized to bar an individual who has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n717 \ncommitted securities fraud from serving as an officer or a director of a company registered under the \nsecurities law. \n \nThird, the SEC can proceed administratively—that is, hold its own hearing, with the usual due process \nrights, before an administrative law judge. If the commissioners by majority vote accept the findings \nof the administrative law judge after reading briefs and hearing oral argument, they can impose a variety \nof sanctions: suspend or expel members of exchanges; deny, suspend, or revoke the registrations of \nbroker-dealers; censure individuals for misconduct; and bar censured individuals (temporarily or \npermanently) from employment with a registered firm. The 1990 securities law amendments allow the \nSEC to impose civil fines similar to the court-imposed fines described. The amendments also authorize \nthe SEC to order individuals to cease and desist from violating securities law. \n \nFundamental Mission \nThe SEC’s fundamental mission is to ensure adequate disclosure in order to facilitate informed \ninvestment decisions by the public. However, whether a particular security offering is worthwhile or \nworthless is a decision for the public, not for the SEC, which has no legal authority to pass on the merits of \nan offering or to bar the sale of securities if proper disclosures are made. \n \nOne example of SEC’s regulatory mandate with respect to disclosures involved the 1981 sale of $274 \nmillion in limited partnership interests in a company called Petrogene Oil & Gas Associates, New York. \nThe Petrogene offering was designed as a tax shelter. The company’s filing with the SEC stated that the \noffering involved “a high degree of risk” and that only those “who can afford the complete loss of their \ninvestment” should contemplate investing. Other disclosures included one member of the controlling \ngroup having spent four months in prison for conspiracy to commit securities fraud; that he and another \nprincipal were the subject of a New Mexico cease and desist order involving allegedly unregistered tax-\nsheltered securities; that the general partner, brother-in-law of one of the principals, had no experience in",

The trading that takes place in the secondary market is far more significant, \nhowever. In a normal year, trading in outstanding stock totals some twenty times the value of new stock \nissues. \n \nTo regulate the secondary market, Congress enacted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This law, \nwhich created the SEC, extended the disclosure rationale to securities listed and registered for public \ntrading on the national securities exchanges.

Today, every state has enacted a blue sky law, so called because its purpose is to \nprevent “speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of ‘blue sky.’” [3] The federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n722 \nSecurities Act of 1933, discussed in Section 17.1.3 \"Securities Act of 1933\", specifically preserves the \njurisdiction of states over securities. \nBlue sky laws are divided into three basic types of regulation. The simplest is that which prohibits fraud in \nthe sale of securities. Thus at a minimum, issuers cannot mislead investors about the purpose of the \ninvestment. All blue sky laws have antifraud provisions; some have no other provisions. The second type \ncalls for registration of broker-dealers, and the third type for registration of securities. Some state laws \nparallel the federal laws in intent and form of proceeding, so that they overlap; other blue sky laws \nempower state officials (unlike the SEC) to judge the merits of the offerings, often referred to as \nmerit review laws. As part of a movement toward deregulation, several states have recently modified or \neliminated merit provisions. \n \nMany of the blue sky laws are inconsistent with each other, making national uniformity difficult. In 1956, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Securities Act. \nIt has not been designed to reconcile the conflicting philosophies of state regulation but to take them into \naccount and to make the various forms of regulation as consistent as possible. States adopt various \nportions of the law, depending on their regulatory philosophies. The Uniform Securities Act has antifraud, \nbroker-dealer registration, and securities registration provisions. More recent acts have further increased \nuniformity. These include the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which preempted \ndiffering state philosophies with regard to registration of securities and regulation of brokers and \nadvisors, and the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which preempted state law \nsecurities fraud claims from being raised in class action lawsuits by investors. \n \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich is the largest amendment to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. \nThis amendment was enacted in response to the economic recession of the late 2000s for the following \npurposes: (1) to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and \ntransparency in the financial system, (2) to end “too big to fail” institutions, (3) to protect the American \ntaxpayer by ending bailouts, and (4) to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n723 \ninstitutions most affected by the regulatory changes include those involved in monitoring the financial \nsystem, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the SEC. Importantly, the \namendment ended the exemption for investment advisors who previously were not required to register \nwith the SEC because they had fewer than fifteen clients during the previous twelve months and did not \nhold out to the public as investment advisors. This means that in practice, numerous investment advisors, \nas well as hedge funds and private equity firms, are now subject to registration requirements.

World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., [1] the first accounting provisions \ncase brought to trial. \n \nInsider Trading \nCorporate insiders—directors, officers, or important shareholders—can have a substantial trading \nadvantage if they are privy to important confidential information. Learning bad news (such as financial \nloss or cancellation of key contracts) in advance of all other stockholders will permit the privileged few to \nsell shares before the price falls. Conversely, discovering good news (a major oil find or unexpected \nprofits) in advance gives the insider a decided incentive to purchase shares before the price rises. \nBecause of the unfairness to those who are ignorant of inside information, federal law \nprohibits insider trading. Two provisions of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act are \nparamount: Section 16(b) and 10(b). \n \nRecapture of Short-Swing Profits: Section 16(b) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n726 \nThe Securities Exchange Act assumes that any director, officer, or shareholder owning 10 percent or more \nof the stock in a corporation is using inside information if he or any family member makes a profit from \ntrading activities, either buying and selling or selling and buying, during a six-month period. Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits. The law applies to any company with more than $10 million in assets and at \nleast five hundred or more shareholders of any class of stock. \n \nSuppose that on January 1, Bob (a company officer) purchases one hundred shares of stock in BCT \nBookstore, Inc., for $60 a share. On September 1, he sells them for $100 a share. What is the result? Bob \nis in the clear, because his $4,000 profit was not realized during a six-month period. Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why? In August, Bob held one hundred shares of stock, and he did again on \nOctober 1—within a six-month period. His net gain on these transactions was $7,000 ($10,000 realized \non the sale less the $3,000 cost of the purchase). \n \nAs a consequence of Section 16(b) and certain other provisions, trading in securities by directors, officers, \nand large stockholders presents numerous complexities. For instance, the law requires people in this \nposition to make periodic reports to the SEC about their trades. As a practical matter, directors, officers, \nand large shareholders should not trade in their own company stock in the short run without legal advice. \n \nInsider Trading: Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits any person from using the mails or \nfacilities of interstate commerce “to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any \nsecurity…any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and \nregulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the \nprotection of investors.” In 1942, the SEC learned of a company president who misrepresented the \ncompany’s financial condition in order to buy shares at a low price from current stockholders. So the \ncommission adopted a rule under the authority of Section 10(b). Rule 10b-5, as it was dubbed, has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n727 \nremained unchanged for more than forty years and has spawned thousands of lawsuits and SEC \nproceedings. It reads as follows: \n \nIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or \ninstrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national \nsecurities exchange, \n \n(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, \n(2) to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary \nin order to make the statements made, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, \nnot misleading, or \n(3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a \nfraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. \n \nRule 10b-5 applies to any person who purchases or sells any security. It is not limited to securities \nregistered under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. It is not limited to publicly held companies. It applies \nto any security issued by any company, including the smallest closely held company.

However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v. O’Hagan, [7] and the SEC adopted the theory as \nnew Rule 10b5-2. Under this new rule, the duty of trust or confidence exists when (1) a person agrees to \nmaintain information in confidence; (2) the recipient knows or should have known through history, \npattern, or practice of sharing confidences that the person communicating the information expects \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n730 \nconfidentiality; and (3) a person received material nonpublic information from his or her spouse, parent, \nchild, or sibling. \n \nIn 1987, in Carpenter v. United States, [8] the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of a Wall Street \nJournal reporter who leaked advanced information about the contents of his “Heard on the Street” \ncolumn. The reporter, who was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, had been convicted on both mail \nand wire fraud and securities law charges for misappropriating information. The Court upheld the mail \nand wire fraud conviction by an 8–0 vote and the securities law conviction by a 4–4 vote. (In effect, the tie \nvote affirmed the conviction.) [9] \n \nBeyond these judge-made theories of liability, Congress had been concerned about insider trading, and in \n1984 and 1988, it substantially increased the penalties. A person convicted of insider trading now faces a \nmaximum criminal fine of $1 million and a possible ten-year prison term. A civil penalty of up to three \ntimes the profit made (or loss avoided) by insider trading can also be imposed. This penalty is in addition \nto liability for profits made through insider trading. For example, financier Ivan Boesky, who was \nsentenced in 1987 to a three-year prison term for insider trading, was required to disgorge $50 million of \nprofits and was liable for another $50 million as a civil penalty. In 2003, Martha Stewart was indicted on \ncharges of insider trading but was convicted for obstruction of justice, serving only five months. More \nrecently, in 2009, billionaire founder of the Galleon Group, Raj Rajaratnam, was arrested for insider \ntrading; he was convicted in May 2011 of all 14 counts of insider trading. For the SEC release on the \nMartha Stewart case, seehttp://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-69.htm. \n \nCompanies that knowingly and recklessly fail to prevent insider trading by their employees are subject to \na civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided by insider trading or $1 million, \nwhichever is greater. Corporations are also subject to a criminal fine of up to $2.5 million. \n \nSecondary Actor \nIn Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, [10] the US Supreme Court held that “aiders and \nabettors” of fraud cannot be held secondarily liable under 10(b) for a private cause of action. This means \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n731 \nthat secondary actors, such as lawyers and accountants, cannot be held liable unless their conduct \nsatisfies all the elements for 10(b) liability. \nFor an overview of insider trading, go to http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm.",

The Court also explicitly has defined a standard of materiality under the securities \nlaws, see TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), concluding in the proxy-solicitation \ncontext that “[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n738 \nwould consider it important in deciding how to vote.”…We now expressly adopt the TSC Industries \nstandard of materiality for the 5 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. \n \nThe application of this materiality standard to preliminary merger discussions is not self-evident. Where \nthe impact of the corporate development on the target’s fortune is certain and clear, the TSC Industries \nmateriality definition admits straight-forward application. Where, on the other hand, the event is \ncontingent or speculative in nature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the “reasonable investor” would \nhave considered the omitted information significant at the time. Merger negotiations, because of the ever-\npresent possibility that the contemplated transaction will not be effectuated, fall into the latter category. \n \n* * * \n \nEven before this Court’s decision in TSC Industries, the Second Circuit had explained the role of the \nmateriality requirement of Rule 10b-5, with respect to contingent or speculative information or events, in \na manner that gave that term meaning that is independent of the other provisions of the Rule. Under such \ncircumstances, materiality “will depend at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated \nprobability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of \nthe company activity.” SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d, at 849. \n \n* * * \n \nWhether merger discussions in any particular case are material therefore depends on the facts. Generally, \nin order to assess the probability that the event will occur, a factfinder will need to look to indicia of \ninterest in the transactions at the highest corporate levels. Without attempting to catalog all such possible \nfactors, we note by way of example that board resolutions, instructions to investment bankers, and actual \nnegotiations between principals or their intermediaries may serve as indicia of interest. To assess the \nmagnitude of the transaction to the issuer of the securities allegedly manipulated, a factfinder will need to \nconsider such facts as the size of the two corporate entities and of the potential premiums over market \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n739 \nvalue. No particular event or factor short of closing the transaction need to be either necessary or \nsufficient by itself to render merger discussions material. \n \nAs we clarify today, materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the \nwithheld or misrepresented information. The fact-specific inquiry we endorse here is consistent with the \napproach a number of courts have taken in assessing the materiality of merger negotiations. Because the \nstandard of materiality we have adopted differs from that used by both courts below, we remand the case \nfor reconsideration of the question whether a grant of summary judgment is appropriate on this record. \n \nWe turn to the question of reliance and the fraud on-the-market theory. Succinctly put: \n \nThe fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed \nsecurities market, the price of a company’s stock is determined by the available information \nregarding the company and its business.…Misleading statements will therefore defraud \npurchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.…The causal \nconnection between the defendants’ fraud and the plaintiff’s purchase of stock in such a case is no \nless significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. Peil v. Speiser, 806 F.2d \n1154, 1160-1161 (CA3 1986). \n \n* * * \nWe agree that reliance is an element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action.

How does the court determine what is or is not material information? How does this differ from its previous \nrulings? \n2. What is the fraud-on-the-market theory? \n \n \n \n17.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nBeyond state corporation laws, federal statutes—most importantly, the Securities Act of 1933 and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934—regulate the issuance and trading of corporate securities. The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company. This law requires issuers to keep accurate \nsets of books reflecting the dispositions of their assets and to maintain internal accounting controls to \nensure that transactions comport with management’s authorization. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 presents special hazards to those trading in public stock on the basis \nof inside information. One provision requires the reimbursement to the company of any profits made \nfrom selling and buying stock during a six-month period by directors, officers, and shareholders owning \n10 percent or more of the company’s stock. Under Rule 10b-5, the SEC and private parties may sue \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n742 \ninsiders who traded on information not available to the general public, thus gaining an advantage in \neither selling or buying the stock.

As with mergers, the boards and shareholders must approve the consolidation by \nmajority votes (see Figure 18.3 \"Consolidation\"). The resulting corporation becomes effective when the \nsecretary of state issues a certificate of merger or incorporation. \n \nFigure 18.3Consolidation \n \n \nFor more information on mergers and consolidation under Delaware law, see Del. Code Ann., Title 8, \nSections 251–267 (2011), at http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/index.shtml#TopOfPage. \n \nPurchase of Stock \nTakeovers \nThe fourth method of expanding, purchase of a company’s stock, is more complicated than the other \nmethods. The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt. A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target. The purchasers also use other types of debt, such as the issuance of bonds or a loan, \nto implement the LBO. \n \nFor more information about tender offers and mergers, see Unocal v. Mesa [3]and Revlon v. MacAndrews \n& Forbes. [4] The Wall Street Journal provides comprehensive coverage of tender offers, mergers, and \nLBOs, athttp://www.wsj.com. \n \nState versus Federal Regulation of Takeovers \nUnder the federal Williams Act, upon commencement of a tender offer for more than 5 percent of the \ntarget’s stock, the offeror must file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nstating the source of funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent \nof its holdings in the target company. Even when a tender offer has not been made, the Williams Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n752 \nrequires any person who acquires more than 5 percent ownership of a corporation to file a statement with \nthe SEC within ten days. The Williams Act, which made certain amendments to the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934, can be viewed at http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/. The US Constitution is also implicated \nin the regulation of foreign corporations. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect. Many of the laws expressly gave management of the target companies a right to a hearing, which \ncould be dragged out for weeks or months, giving the target time to build up a defense. The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state",

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts.

Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however. The state attorney general has authority to collect \ncivil penalties that vary from state to state. Other sanctions in various states include fines and penalties on \ntaxes owed; fines and imprisonment of corporate agents, directors, and officers; nullification of corporate \ncontracts; and personal liability on contracts by officers and directors. In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court \nupheld the validity of long-arm statutes applied to corporations in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington. [3] But the long-arm statute will only be constitutionally valid where there are minimum \ncontacts—that is, for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, the foreign \ncorporation must have at least “minimum contacts” the state. That jurisdictional test is still applied many \nyears after the International Shoe decision was handed down. [4] Since International Shoe, the \nnationalization of commerce has given way to the internationalization of commerce. This change has \nresulted in difficult jurisdictional questions that involve conflicting policy considerations.

Since a state may obviously tax its domestic corporations, the \nquestion might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause.

Rptr. 574 (Cal. 1977) \n \nClaiming damages for injury from a defective ladder, plaintiff asserts strict tort liability against defendant \nAlad Corporation (Alad II) which neither manufactured nor sold the ladder but prior to plaintiff’s injury \nsucceeded to the business of the ladder’s manufacturer, the now dissolved “Alad Corporation” (Alad I), \nthrough a purchase of Alad I’s assets for an adequate cash consideration. Upon acquiring Alad I’s plant, \nequipment, inventory, trade name, and good will, Alad II continued to manufacture the same line of \nladders under the “Alad” name, using the same equipment, designs, and personnel, and soliciting Alad I’s \ncustomers through the same sales representatives with no outward indication of any change in the \nownership of the business. The trial court entered summary judgment for Alad II and plaintiff appeals.… \n \nOur discussion of the law starts with the rule ordinarily applied to the determination of whether a \ncorporation purchasing the principal assets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities. As \ntypically formulated, the rule states that the purchaser does not assume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) \nthere is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n764 \nmerger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) \nthe transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller’s \ndebts. \n \nIf this rule were determinative of Alad II’s liability to plaintiff it would require us to affirm the summary \njudgment. None of the rule’s four stated grounds for imposing liability on the purchasing corporation is \npresent here. There was no express or implied agreement to assume liability for injury from defective \nproducts previously manufactured by Alad I. Nor is there any indication or contention that the transaction \nwas prompted by any fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for Alad I’s debts. \n \nWith respect to the second stated ground for liability, the purchase of Alad I’s assets did not amount to a \nconsolidation or merger. This exception has been invoked where one corporation takes all of another’s \nassets without providing any consideration that could be made available to meet claims of the other’s \ncreditors or where the consideration consists wholly of shares of the purchaser’s stock which are promptly \ndistributed to the seller’s shareholders in conjunction with the seller’s liquidation. In the present case the \nsole consideration given for Alad I’s assets was cash in excess of $ 207,000. Of this amount Alad I was \npaid $ 70,000 when the assets were transferred and at the same time a promissory note was given to Alad \nI for almost $ 114,000. Shortly before the dissolution of Alad I the note was assigned to the Hamblys, Alad \nI’s principal stockholders, and thereafter the note was paid in full. The remainder of the consideration \nwent for closing expenses or was paid to the Hamblys for consulting services and their agreement not to \ncompete. There is no contention that this consideration was inadequate or that the cash and promissory \nnote given to Alad I were not included in the assets available to meet claims of Alad I’s creditors at the \ntime of dissolution. Hence the acquisition of Alad I’s assets was not in the nature of a merger or",

You are familiar with one kind of commercial paper: a check. \n \n \n19.1 Introduction to Commercial Paper \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand why commercial paper is an important concept in modern finance. \n2. Be familiar with the historical development of commercial paper. \n3. Recognize how commercial paper is viewed in economics and finance. \n \n \n \n \nThe Importance of Commercial Paper \nBecause commercial paper is a vital invention for the working of our economic system, brief attention to \nits history and its function as a medium of exchange in economics and finance is appropriate. \n \nThe Central Role of Commercial Paper \nCommercial paper is the collective term for various financial instruments, or tools, that include checks \ndrawn on commercial banks, drafts (drawn on something other than a bank), certificates of deposit, and \nnotes evidencing a promise to pay. Like money, commercial paper is a medium of exchange, but because it \nis one step removed from money, difficulties arise that require a series of interlocking rules to protect \nboth sellers and buyers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n775 \nTo understand the importance of commercial paper, consider the following example. It illustrates a \ndistinction that is critical to the discussion in our four chapters on commercial paper. \n \nLorna Love runs a tennis club. She orders a truckload of new tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc., a \nmanufacturer. The contract price of the rackets is $100,000. Rackets ships the rackets to Love. Rackets \nthen sells for $90,000 its contract rights (rights to receive the payment from Love of $100,000) to First \nBank (see Figure 19.1 \"Assignment of Contract Rights\"). Unfortunately, the rackets that arrive at Love’s \nare warped and thus commercially worthless. Rackets files for bankruptcy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.1 Assignment of Contract Rights \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n776 \nMay the bank collect from Love $100,000, the value of the contract rights it purchased? No. Under the \n“shoe rule” an assignee—here, the bank—steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes the assigned rights \nsubject to any defense of the obligor, Love. (Here, of course, Love’s defense against paying is that the \nrackets are worthless.) The result would be the same if Love had given Rackets a nonnegotiable note, \nwhich Rackets proceeded to sell to the bank. (By nonnegotiable we do not mean that the note cannot be \nsold but only that certain legal requirements, discussed in Section 19.3 \"Requirements for \nNegotiability\" of this chapter, have not been met.) \n \nNow let us add one fact: In addition to signing a contract, Love gives Rackets a negotiable note in \nexchange for the rackets, and Rackets sells the note to the bank.

Pertinent to the issues on \nthis appeal, Centerre’s petition averred: \n \n“1. …on [May 7,] 1985, the [Campbells] made and delivered to Strand…their promissory note…and \nthereby promised to pay to Strand…or its order…($11,250.00) with interest thereon from date at the rate \nof fourteen percent (14%) per annum; that a copy of said promissory note is attached hereto…and \nincorporated herein by reference. \n \n2. That thereafter and before maturity, said note was assigned and delivered by Strand…to [Centerre] for \nvaluable consideration and [Centerre] is the owner and holder of said promissory note.” \n \nCenterre’s petition went on to allege that default had been made in payment of the note and that there was \nan unpaid principal balance of $9,000, plus accrued interest, due thereon. Centerre’s petition prayed for \njudgment against the Campbells for the unpaid principal and interest. \n \n[The Campbells] aver that the note was given for the purchase of an interest in a limited partnership to be \ncreated by Strand, that no limited partnership was thereafter created by Strand, and that by reason \nthereof there was “a complete and total failure of consideration for the said promissory note.” \nConsequently, pled the answers, Centerre “should be estopped from asserting a claim against [the \nCampbells] on said promissory note because of such total failure of consideration for same.” \n \nThe cause was tried to the court, all parties having waived trial by jury. At trial, the attorney for the \nCampbells asked Curtis D. Campbell what the consideration was for the note. Centerre’s attorney \ninterrupted: “We object to any testimony as to the consideration for the note because it’s our position that \nis not a defense in this lawsuit since the bank is the holder in due course.”… \n \n \nThe trial court entered judgment in favor of Centerre and against the Campbells for $9,000, plus accrued \ninterest and costs. The trial court filed no findings of fact or conclusions of law, none having been \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n801 \nrequested. The trial court did, however, include in its judgment a finding that Centerre “is a holder in due \ncourse of the promissory note sued upon.” \n \nThe Campbells appeal, briefing four points. Their first three, taken together, present a single hypothesis of \nerror consisting of these components: (a) the Campbells showed “by clear and convincing evidence a valid \nand meritorious defense in that there existed a total lack and failure of consideration for the promissory \nnote in question,” (b) Centerre acquired the note subject to such defense in that Centerre was not a holder \nin due course, as one can be a holder in due course of a note only if the note is a negotiable instrument, \nand (c) the note was not a negotiable instrument inasmuch as “it failed to state a sum certain due the \npayee.”… \n \nWe have already noted that if Centerre is not a holder in due course, the Campbells can assert the defense \nof failure of consideration against Centerre to the same degree they could have asserted it against Strand. \nWe have also spelled out that Centerre cannot be a holder in due course if the note is not a negotiable \ninstrument. The pivotal issue, therefore, is whether the provision that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand prevents the note from being a negotiable instrument.… \n \nNeither side has cited a Missouri case applying [UCC 3-104(a)] to a note containing a provision similar to: \n“Interest may vary with bank rates charged to Strand.” Our independent research has likewise proven \nfruitless. There are, however, instructive decisions from other jurisdictions. \n \nIn Taylor v. Roeder, [Citation, Virginia] (1987), a note provided for interest at “[t]hree percent (3.00%) \nover Chase Manhattan prime to be adjusted monthly.” A second note provided for interest at “3% over \nChase Manhattan prime adjusted monthly.” Applying sections of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted \nby Virginia identical to [the Missouri UCC], the court held the notes were not negotiable instruments in \nthat the amounts required to satisfy them could not be ascertained without reference to an extrinsic \nsource, the varying prime rate of interest charged by Chase Manhattan Bank. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n802 \nIn Branch Banking and Trust Co. v. Creasy, [Citation, North Carolina] (1980), a guaranty agreement \nprovided that the aggregate amount of principal of all indebtedness and liabilities at any one time for \nwhich the guarantor would be liable shall not exceed $35,000. The court, emphasizing that to be a \nnegotiable instrument a writing must contain, among other things, an unconditional promise to pay a sum \ncertain in money, held the agreement was not a negotiable instrument.

Negotiation always requires a change in possession \nof the instrument because nobody can be a holder without possessing the instrument, either \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n812 \ndirectly or through an agent. But in some cases the transfer of possession is involuntary and in \nsome cases the person transferring possession is not a holder.…[S]ubsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is \npayable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the \nholder of the instrument when possession is obtained. In this case there is an involuntary transfer \nof possession that results in negotiation to Thief or Finder. [1] \n \nIn other words, to qualify as a holder, a person must possess an instrument that runs to her. An \ninstrument “runs” to a person if (1) it has been issued to her or (2) it has been transferred to her by \nnegotiation (negotiation is the “post-issuance event” cited in the comment). Commercially speaking, the \nstatus of the immediate person to whom the instrument was issued (the payee) is not very interesting; the \nthing of interest is whether the instrument is passed on by the payee after possession, through \nnegotiation. Yes, the payee of an instrument is a holder, and can be a holder in due course, but the crux of \nnegotiable instruments involves taking an instrument free of defenses that might be claimed by anybody \nagainst paying on the instrument; the payee would know of defenses, usually, so—as the comment puts \nit—“use of the holder-in-due-course doctrine by the payee of an instrument is not the normal \nsituation.…[r]ather, the holder in due course is an immediate or remote transferee of the payee.” [2] \n \nLiability of Transferors \nWe discuss liability in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". However, a brief introduction to liability will \nhelp in understanding the types of indorsements discussed in this chapter. There are two types of liability \naffecting transferors: contract liability and warranty liability. \n \nContract Liability \nPersons who sign the instrument—that is, makers, acceptors, drawers, indorsers—have signed a contract \nand are subject to contract liabilities. Drafts (checks) and notes are, after all, contracts. Makers and \nacceptors are primary parties and are unconditionally liable to pay the instrument. Drawers and \nindorsers are secondary parties and are conditionally liable. The conditions creating liability—that is, \npresentment, dishonor, and notice—are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n813 \n \nWarranty Liability \nThe transferor’s contract liability is limited. It applies only to those who sign and only if certain additional \nconditions are met and, as will be discussed, can even be disclaimed. Consequently, a holder who has not \nbeen paid often must resort to a suit based on one of five warranties. These warranties are implied by law; \nUCC, Section 3-416, details them: \n \n(A) A person who transfers an instrument for consideration warrants all of the following to the \ntransferee and, if the transfer is by indorsement, to any subsequent transferee: \n(1) The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the instrument. \n(2) All signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized. \n(3) The instrument has not been altered. \n(4) The instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which can be \nasserted against the warrantor. \n(5) The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to \nthe maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer. \n \nBreach of one of these warranties must be proven at trial if there is no general contract liability. \n \nLiability of Transferees \nThe transferee takes by assignment; as an assignee, the new owner of the instrument has only those rights \nheld by the assignor. Claims that could be asserted by third parties against the assignor can be asserted \nagainst the assignee. A negotiable instrument can be transferred in this sense without being negotiated. A \npayee, for example, might fail to meet all the requirements of negotiation; in that event, the instrument \nmight wind up being merely transferred (assigned). When all requirements of negotiability and \nnegotiation have been met, the buyer is a holder and may (if a holder in due course—see Chapter 21 \n\"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\") collect on the instrument without having to prove anything more. \nBut if the instrument was not properly negotiated, the purchaser is at most a transferee and cannot collect \nif defenses are available, even if the paper itself is negotiable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n814 \n \nHow Negotiation Is Accomplished \nNegotiation can occur with either bearer paper or order paper.",

In its place, the qualified indorser warrants merely that he has no knowledge of any defense. \n \n“Without recourse” indorsements can have a practical impact on the balance sheet.

The Federal Reserve \nBoard has recommendations for how instruments should be indorsed to speed machine reading of them. \nIndorsements are either blank or special; they are either restrictive or nonrestrictive; and they are either \nqualified or unqualified.

Recognize under what circumstances a negotiation is subject to rescission. \n2. Know the effect of reacquisition of an instrument. \n3. Understand how instruments made payable to two or more persons are negotiated. \n4. Understand how the UCC treats forged indorsements, imposters, and other signatures in the name of the \npayee. \n \n \nCommon Issues Arising in Negotiation of Commercial Paper \nA number of problems commonly arise that affect the negotiation of commercial paper. Here we take up \nthree. \n \nNegotiation Subject to Rescission \nA negotiation—again, transfer of possession to a person who becomes a holder—can be effective even \nwhen it is made by a person without the capacity to sign. Section 3-202(a) of the UCC declares that \nnegotiation is effective even when the indorsement is made by an infant or by a corporation exceeding its \npowers; is obtained by fraud, duress, or mistake; is part of an illegal transaction; or is made in breach of a \nduty. \n \nHowever, unless the instrument was negotiated to a holder in due course, the indorsement can be \nrescinded or subjected to another appropriate legal remedy. The Official Comment to this UCC section is \nhelpful: \n \nSubsection (a) applies even though the lack of capacity or the illegality is of a character which \ngoes to the essence of the transaction and makes it entirely void. It is inherent in the character of \nnegotiable instruments that any person in possession of an instrument which by its terms is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n825 \npayable to that person or to bearer is a holder and may be dealt with by anyone as a holder. The \nprinciple finds its most extreme application in the well-settled rule that a holder in due course \nmay take the instrument even from a thief and be protected against the claim of the rightful \nowner. The policy of subsection (a) is that any person to whom an instrument is negotiated is a \nholder until the instrument has been recovered from that person’s possession. [1] \n \nSo suppose a mentally incapacitated person under a guardianship evades her guardian, goes to town, and \nwrites a check for a new car. Normally, contracts made by such persons are void. But the check is \nnegotiable here. If the guardian finds out about the escapade before the check leaves the dealer’s hands, \nthe deal could be rescinded: the check could be retrieved and the car returned. \n \nEffect of Reacquisition \nA prior party who reacquires an instrument may reissue it or negotiate it further. But doing so discharges \nintervening parties as to the reacquirer and to later purchasers who are not holders in due course. Section \n3-207 of the UCC permits the reacquirer to cancel indorsements unnecessary to his title or ownership; in \nso doing, he eliminates the liability of such indorsers even as to holders in due course.",

SAMS are automated machines which permit a bettor to enter his bet \nby inserting money, vouchers or credit cards into the machine, thereby enabling him to select the \nnumber or combination he wishes to purchase. A ticket is issued showing those numbers. [1] \n \nWhen a voucher is utilized for the purpose of placing a bet at a SAMS machine, the SAMS machine, after \ndeducting the amount bet by the horse player during the particular transaction, provides the horse player \nwith, in addition to his betting ticket(s), a new voucher showing the remaining balance left on the \nvoucher. \n \nIn the instant case, the unfortunate horse player departed the SAMS machine with his betting tickets, \nbut without his new voucher—showing thousands of dollars in remaining value—which he inadvertently \nleft sitting in the SAMS machine. Within several minutes he realized his mistake and hurried back to the \nSAMS machine, only to find the voucher gone. He immediately notified a security guard. The defendant’s \npersonnel thereafter quickly confirmed the plaintiff as the original purchaser of the lost voucher. The \ndefendant placed a computerized “stop” on the voucher. However, whoever had happened upon the \nvoucher in the SAMS machine and taken it had acted even more quickly: the voucher had been brought to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n832 \na nearby track window and “cashed out” within a minute or so of the plaintiff having mistakenly left it in \nthe SAMS machine. \n \nThe plaintiff now sues the defendant, contending that the defendant should be liable for having failed to \n“provide any minimal protection to its customers” in checking the identity and ownership of vouchers \nprior to permitting their “cash out.” The defendant, in response, contends that the voucher consists of \n“bearer paper,” negotiable by anyone having possession, and that it is under no obligation to purchasers \nof vouchers to provide any such identity or ownership checks. \n \nAs opposed to instruments such as ordinary checks, which are typically made payable to the order of a \nspecific person and are therefore known as “order paper,” bearer paper is payable to the “bearer,” i.e., \nwhoever walks in carrying (or “bearing”) the instrument. Pursuant to [New York’s UCC] “[a]n instrument \nis payable to bearer when by its terms it is payable to…(c) ‘cash’ or the order of ‘cash’, or any other \nindication which does not purport to designate a specific payee.” \n \nEach New York Racing Association voucher is labeled “Cash Voucher.” Each voucher contains the legend \n“Bet Against the Value or Exchange for Cash.” Each voucher is also encoded with certain computer \nsymbols which are readable by SAMS machines. The vouchers do by their terms constitute “bearer paper.” \n \nThere is no doubt that under the [1990 Revision] Model Uniform Commercial Code the defendant would \nbe a “holder in due course” of the voucher, deemed to have taken it free from all defenses that could be \nraised by the plaintiff. As observed in 2 White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code pp. 225–226, 152–\n153 (4th ed.1995): \n \nConsider theft of bearer instruments…[T]he thief can make his or her transferee a holder simply \nby transfer to one who gives value in good faith. If the thief’s transferee cashes the check and so \ngives value in good faith and without notice of any defense, that transferee will be a holder in due \ncourse under 3-302, free of all claims to the instrument on the part…of any person and free of all \npersonal defenses of any prior party. Therefore, the holder in due course will not be liable in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n833 \nconversion to the true owner.…Of course, the owner of the check will have a good cause of action \nagainst the thief, but no other cause of action.… \n \nIf an instrument is payable to bearer…the possessor of the instrument will be a holder and, if he \nmeets the other tests, a holder in due course. This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York.

This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York. [2] In 1990, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Law Institute \napproved a revised Article 3. This revised Article 3 has never been enacted in New York. Comment 1 to § \n3-201 of the [1990] Uniform Commercial Code, commenting on the difference between it and its \npredecessor (which is still in effect in New York), states: \n \nA person can become holder of an instrument…as the result of an event that occurs after issuance. \n“Negotiation” is the term used in Article 3 to describe this post-issuance event.…In defining \n“negotiation” former Section 3-202(1) used the word “transfer,” an undefined term, and \n“delivery,” defined in Section 1-201(14) to mean voluntary change of possession. Instead, \nsubsections (a) and (b) [now] use the term “transfer of possession,” and subsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is \npayable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the \nholder of the instrument when possession is obtained. In this case there is an involuntary transfer \nof possession that results in negotiation to Thief or Finder. \n \nThus, it would initially appear that under the prior Model Uniform Commercial Code, still in effect in New \nYork, a thief or finder of bearer paper, as the recipient of an involuntary transfer, could not become a \n“holder,” and thus could not pass holder-in-due-course status, or good title, to someone in the position of \nthe defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n834 \nThis conclusion, however, is not without doubt. For instance, in 2 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code § \n3-202:35 (2nd ed.1971), it was observed that: \n \nThe Code states that bearer paper is negotiated by “delivery.” This is likely to mislead for one is \nnot inclined to think of the acquisition of paper by a finder or a thief as a “voluntary transfer of \npossession.” \nBy stating that the Code’s terminology was “misleading,” the treatise appears to imply that despite the \nliteral import of the words, the contrary was true—negotiation could be accomplished by involuntary \ntransfer, i.e., loss or theft. \n \nIn [Citation], the Appellate Division determined that the Tropicana Casino in New Jersey became a holder \nin due course of signed cashier’s checks with blank payee designations which a thief had stolen from the \ndefendant and negotiated to the casino for value after filling in the payee designation with his brother-in-\nlaw’s name. The Appellate Division, assuming without discussion that the thief was a “holder” of the \nstolen instruments and therefore able to transfer good title, held the defendant obligated to make \npayment on the stolen checks. Accord [Citation] (check cashing service which unknowingly took for value \nfrom an intervening thief the plaintiff’s check, which the plaintiff had endorsed in blank and thus \nconverted to a bearer instrument, was a holder in due course of the check, having received good title from \nthe thief). \n \nPresumably, these results have occurred because the courts in New York have implicitly interpreted the \nundefined term “transfer” as utilized in [the pre-1990] U.C.C. § 3-202(1) as including the involuntary \ntransfer of possession, so that as a practical matter the old Code (as still in effect in New York) has the \nsame meaning as the new Model Uniform Commercial Code, which represents a clarification rather than a \nchange in the law. \n \nThis result makes sense. A contrary result would require extensive verification procedures to be \nundertaken by all transferees of bearer paper. The problem with imposing an identity or ownership check \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n835 \nrequirement on the negotiation of bearer paper is that such a requirement would impede the free \nnegotiability which is the essence of bearer paper. As held in [Citation (1970)], \n \n[Where] the instrument entrusted to a dishonest messenger or agent was freely negotiable bearer \npaper…the drawee bank [cannot] be held liable for making payment to one presenting a \nnegotiable instrument in bearer form who may properly be presumed to be a holder [citations \nomitted]. \n…Moreover, the plaintiff in the instant case knew that the voucher could be “Exchange[d] for cash.” The \nplaintiff conceded at trial that (1) when he himself utilized the voucher prior to its loss, no identity or",

            "chunk": "depositary bank under these sections” [Citation]…The Court finds the reasoning persuasive and holds \nthat…Victory can maintain its cause of action against Wachovia. \n \nIII. The Fictitious Payee Rule \nLunny made the fraudulent checks payable to actual vendors of Victory with the intention that the \nvendors not get paid. Wachovia therefore argues that Victory’s action against it should be barred by the \nfictitious payee rule under UCC 3-404 [which] states, in relevant part: \n \n(b) Fictitious Payee. If a person…does not intend the person identified as payee to have any \ninterest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, \nthe following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement: \n(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder. \n(2) An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as \nthe indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes \nit for value or for collection.… \n \nThe theory under the rule is that since the indorsement is “effective,” the drawee bank was justified in \ndebiting the company’s account. Therefore, [Wachovia argues] the loss should fall on the company whose \nemployee committed the fraud. \n \n…[However] under revised UCC §§ 3-404 and 3-405, the fictitious payee defense triggers principles of \ncomparative fault, so a depositary bank’s own negligence may be considered by the trier of \nfact.…Therefore, based on the foregoing reasons, the fictitious payee defense does not help Wachovia in \nthis case. \n \n \n \nIV. Allocation of Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n840 \nAs stated supra, comparative negligence applies in this case because of the revisions in the Code. In \ndetermining the liability of the parties, the Court has considered, inter alia [among other things], the \nfollowing factors: \n \n• \nAt the time of the fraud by Lunny, Wachovia’s policies and regulations regarding the acceptance \nof checks for deposit provided that “checks payable to a non-personal payee can be deposited \nONLY into a non-personal account with the same name.” [Emphasis in original] \n• \nApproximately two hundred (200) checks drawn on Victory’s corporate account were deposited \ninto Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. \n• \nThe first twenty-three (23) fraudulent checks were made payable to entities that were not readily \ndistinguishable as businesses, such as “Sean John.” The check dated December 17, 2001 was the \nfirst fraudulent check made payable to a payee that was clearly a business, specifically “Beverly \nHills Shoes, Inc.” \n• \nIn 2001, Victory had approximately seventeen (17) employees, including Lunny. \n• \nLunny had been a bookkeeper for Victory from approximately 1982 until she resigned in May \n2003. Rosenfeld never had any problems with Lunny’s bookkeeping before she resigned. \n• \nLunny exercised primary control over Victory’s bank accounts. \n• \nBetween 2001 and 2003, the checks that were generated to make payments to Victory’s vendors \nwere all computerized checks generated by Lunny. No other Victory employee, other than Lunny, \nknew how to generate the computerized checks, including Rosenfeld. \n• \nThe fraudulent checks were made payable to known vendors of Victory in amounts that were \nconsistent with previous legitimate checks to those vendors. \n• \nAfter forging the indorsement of the payee, Lunny either indorsed the check with her name \nfollowed by her account number, or referenced her account number following the forged \nindorsement. \n• \nAbout ten (10) out of approximately three hundred (300) checks each month were forged by \nLunny and deposited into her personal account. \n• \nRosenfeld reviewed his bank statements from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n841 \n• \nRosenfeld received copies of Victory’s cancelled checks from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nHowever, the copies of the cancelled checks were not in their normal size; instead, they were \nsmaller, with six checks (front and back side) on each page. \n• \nThe forged indorsements were written out in longhand, i.e., Lunny’s own handwriting, rather \nthan a corporate stamped signature. \n• \nVictory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each month. \n• \nAn outside accounting firm performed quarterly reviews of Victory’s bookkeeping records, and \nthen met with Rosenfeld. This review was not designed to pick up fraud or misappropriation. \n \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Victory and Wachovia are comparatively negligent. \n \nWith regard to Wachovia’s negligence, it is clear that Wachovia was negligent in violating its own rules in \nrepeatedly depositing corporate checks into Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. Standard commercial \nbank procedures dictate that a check made payable to a business be accepted only into a business \nchecking account with the same title as the business.

[plaintiff] (“Wisner”), appeals from a summary judgment in favor of the \ndefendant, Richland State Bank. At issue is the deposit of a check with a typed statement on the back \ndirecting that a portion of the funds be paid to a third party. We affirm the trial court judgment. \n \nFacts \nOn July 13, 2001, the United States Treasury, through the Farm Service Agency, issued a check in the \namount of $17,420.00, made payable to Chad E. Gill. On the back of the check the following was typed: \nPAY TO THE ORDER OF RICHLAND STATE BANK FOR ISSUANCE OF A CASHIER’S CHECK \nPAYABLE TO WISNER ELEVATOR IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,200.50 AND PAY THE BALANCE \nTO CHAD GILL IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,219.50. \n \nOn July 23, 2001, the check was deposited into Gill’s checking account at Richland State Bank. Gill’s \nsignature is found on the back of the check below the typed paragraph. No cashier check to Wisner \nElevator was issued; instead the entire amount was deposited into Gill’s checking account as per Gill’s \ndeposit ticket. \n \n…On May 28, 2002, Wisner filed suit against the bank, claiming that its failure to apply the funds as per \nthe restrictive indorsement constituted a conversion of the portion of the check due to Wisner under UCC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n844 \n3-206(c)(2) [that a depositary bank converts an instrument if it pays out on an indorsement “indicating a \npurpose of having the instrument collected for the indorser or for a particular account”]. \n \n[The bank] asserted that the indorsement on the back of the check was a conditional indorsement and \nineffective under 3-206(b), [which states:] \n \nAn indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect \nthe right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it \nfor value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person \nare not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled. \n \n…[T]he bank asserts the fault of the United States Treasury…, in failing to make the check payable to both \nGill and Wisner. To the extent that the indorsement was conditional, the bank contends that it was \nunenforceable; to the extent that it was restrictive, it maintains that the restrictions were waived by the \nindorser when he deposited the full amount of the check into his own checking account. \n \nWisner…[stated that it] was owed $13,200.50 by Gill for seeds, chemicals, crop supplies and agricultural \nseed technology fees. [It] further stated that Gill never paid the $13,200.50 he owed and that Wisner did \nnot receive a cashier’s check issued in that amount by Richland State Bank.…According to [the bank \nteller], Gill asked to deposit the entire amount in his account. She further stated that the bank was \nunaware that the indorsement was written by someone other than Gill. \n \n…The court found that the typed indorsement placed on the check was the indorsement of the maker, not \nGill. However, when Gill signed below the indorsement, he made it his own indorsement. The court \nconcluded that Gill had the legal power and authority to verbally instruct that the entire proceeds be \ndeposited into his account. The court stated that as long as the indorsement was his own, whether it was \nrestrictive or conditional, Gill had the power to ignore it, strike it out or give contrary instructions. The \ncourt further concluded that the bank acted properly when it followed the verbal instructions given by Gill \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n845 \nto the teller and the written instructions on his deposit slip to deposit the entire proceeds into Gill’s \naccount. Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the",

So a holder is one who \npossesses an instrument and who has all the necessary indorsements. \n \nTaken for Value \nSection 3-303 of the UCC describes what is meant by transferring an instrument “for value.” In a broad \nsense, it means the holder has given something for it, which sounds like consideration. But “value” here is \nnot the same as consideration under contract law. Here is the UCC language: \n \nAn instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply: \n \n(1) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the \npromise has been performed. \n(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien \nobtained by judicial proceeding. \n(3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim \nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n856 \n(4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. \n(5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable \nobligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument. \n \n1. For a promise, to the extent performed. Suppose A contracts with B: “I’ll buy your car for $5,000.” \nUnder contract law, A has given consideration: the promise is enough. But this executory (not yet \nperformed) promise given by A is not giving “value” to support the HDC status because the promise has \nnot been performed. \n \nLorna Love sells her car to Paul Purchaser for $5,000, and Purchaser gives her a note in that amount. \nLove negotiates the note to Rackets, Inc., for a new shipment of tennis rackets to be delivered in thirty \ndays. Rackets never delivers the tennis rackets. Love has a claim for $5,000 against Rackets, which is not \nan HDC because its promise to deliver is still executory. Assume Paul Purchaser has a defense against \nLove (a reason why he doesn’t want to pay on the note), perhaps because the car was defective. When \nRackets presents the note to Purchaser for payment, he refuses to pay, raising his defense against Love. If \nRackets had been an HDC, Purchaser would be obligated to pay on the note regardless of the defense he \nmight have had against Love, the payee. See Carter & Grimsley v. Omni Trading, Inc., Section 21.3 \n\"Cases\", regarding value as related to executory contracts. \n \nA taker for value can be a partial HDC if the consideration was only partly performed. Suppose the tennis \nrackets were to come in two lots, each worth $2,500, and Rackets only delivered one lot. Rackets would be \nan HDC only to the extent of $2,500, and the debtor—Paul Purchaser—could refuse to pay $2,500 of the \npromised sum. \n \nThe UCC presents two exceptions to the rule that an executory promise is not value. Section 3-303(a)(4) \nprovides that an instrument is issued or transferred for value if the issuer or transferor gives it in \nexchange for a negotiable instrument, and Section 3-303(5) says an instrument is transferred for value if \nthe issuer gives it in exchange for an irrevocable obligation to a third party. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n857 \n2. Security interest. Value is not limited to cash or the fulfillment of a contractual obligation. A holder \nwho acquires a lien on, or a security interest in, an instrument other than by legal process has taken for \nvalue. \n \n3. Antecedent debt. Likewise, taking an instrument in payment of, or as security for, a prior claim, \nwhether or not the claim is due, is a taking for value. Blackstone owes Webster $1,000, due in thirty days. \nBlackstone unexpectedly receives a refund check for $1,000 from the Internal Revenue Service and \nindorses it to Webster. Webster is an HDC though he gave value in the past. \n \nThe rationale for the rule of value is that if the holder has not yet given anything of value in exchange for \nthe instrument, he still has an effective remedy should the instrument prove defective: he can rescind the \ntransaction, given the transferor’s breach of warranty. \n \nIn Good Faith \nSection 3-103(4) of the UCC defines good faith as “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable \ncommercial standards of fair dealing.” \n \nHonesty in Fact \n“Honesty in fact” is subjectively tested. Suppose Lorna Love had given Rackets, Inc., a promissory note for \nthe tennis rackets. Knowing that it intended to deliver defective tennis rackets and that Love is likely to \nprotest as soon as the shipment arrives, Rackets offers a deep discount on the note to its fleet mechanic: \ninstead of the $1,000 face value of the note, Rackets will give it to him in payment of an outstanding bill of \n$400. The mechanic, being naive in commercial dealings, has no suspicion from the large discount that \nRackets might be committing fraud. He has acted in good faith under the UCC test.

Understand how the holder-in-due-course doctrine has been modified for consumer transactions and why. \n \n \nDefenses \nWe mentioned in Section 21.1 \"Holder in Due Course\" that the importance of the holder-in-due-course \nstatus is that it promotes ready transferability of commercial paper by giving transferees confidence that \nthey can buy and in turn sell negotiable instruments without concern that somebody upstream—previous \nholders in the chain of distribution—will have some reason not to pay. The holder-in-due-course doctrine \nmakes the paper almost as readily transferable as cash. Almost, but not quite. We examine first the \ndefenses to which the holder in due course (HDC) is not subject and then—the “almost” part—the \ndefenses to which even HDCs are subject. \n \nHolder in Due Course Is Not Subject to Personal Defenses \nAn HDC is not subject to the obligor’s personal defenses. But a holder who is not an HDC is subject to \nthem: he takes a negotiable instrument subject to the possible personal claims and defenses of numerous \npeople. \nIn general, the personal defenses—to which the HDC is not subject—are similar to the whole range of \ndefenses for breach of simple contract: lack of consideration; failure of consideration; duress, undue \ninfluence, and misrepresentation that does not render the transaction void; breach of warranty; \nunauthorized completion of an incomplete instrument; prior payment. Incapacity that does not render the \ntransaction void (except infancy) is also a personal defense. As the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) puts \nit, this includes “mental incompetence, guardianship, ultra vires acts or lack of corporate capacity to do \nbusiness, or any other incapacity apart from infancy. If under the state law the effect is to render the \nobligation of the instrument entirely null and void, the defense may be asserted against a holder in due \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n863 \ncourse. If the effect is merely to render the obligation voidable at the election of the obligor, the defense is \ncut off.” [1] James White and Robert Summers, in their hornbook on the UCC, opine that unconscionability \nis almost always a personal defense, not assertable against an HDC. [2] But again, the HDC takes free only \nfrom personal defenses of parties with whom she has not dealt. So while the payee of a note can be an \nHDC, if he dealt with the maker, he is subject to the maker’s defenses. \n \nHolder in Due Course Is Subject to Real Defenses \nAn HDC in a nonconsumer transaction is not subject to personal defenses, but he is subject to the so-\ncalled real defenses (or “universal defenses”)—they are good against an HDC. \nThe real defenses good against any holder, including HDCs, are as follows (see Figure 21.2 \"Real \nDefenses\"): \n \n1. Unauthorized signature (forgery) (UCC, Section 3-401(a)) \n2. Bankruptcy (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n3. Infancy (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n4. Fraudulent alteration (UCC, Section 3-407(b) and (c)) \n5. Duress, mental incapacity, or illegality that renders the obligation void (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n6. Fraud in the execution (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n7. Discharge of which the holder has notice when he takes the instrument (UCC, Section 3-601) \nFigure 21.2 Real Defenses \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n864 \nAnalysis of the Real Defenses \nThough most of these concepts are pretty clear, a few comments by way of analysis are appropriate. \n \nForgery \nForgery is a real defense to an action by an HDC. As we have noted, though, negligence in the making or \nhandling of a negotiable instrument may cut off this defense against an HDC—as, for example, when a \ndrawer who uses a rubber signature stamp carelessly leaves it unattended. And notice, too, that Section 3-\n308 of the UCC provides that signatures are presumed valid unless their validity is specifically denied, at \nwhich time the burden shifts to the person claiming validity. These issues are discussed in Triffin v. \nSomerset Valley Bank, in Section 21.3 \"Cases\" of this chapter. \n \nBankruptcy \nDrawers, makers, and subsequent indorsers are not liable to an HDC if they have been discharged in \nbankruptcy. If they were, bankruptcy would not serve much purpose. \n \n \n \nInfancy \nWhether an infant’s signature on a negotiable instrument is a valid defense depends on the law of the \nstate. In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a",

An alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration \nunless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. But a nonfraudulent alteration—for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n865 \nexample, filling in an omitted date or giving the obligor the benefit of a lower interest rate—does not \ndischarge the obligor. In any case, the person paying or taking the instrument may pay or collect \n“according to its original terms, or in the case of an incomplete instrument that is altered by unauthorized \ncompletion, according to its terms as completed. If blanks are filled or an incomplete instrument is \notherwise completed, subsection (c) places the loss upon the party who left the instrument incomplete by \npermitting enforcement in its completed form. This result is intended even though the instrument was \nstolen from the issuer and completed after the theft.” A moral here: don’t leave instruments lying around \nwith blanks that could be filled in. \n \nVoid Contract \nA void contract is distinguished from a voidable contract; only the former is a real defense. \n \nFraud in the Execution \nYou may recall that this is the rather unusual situation in which a person is tricked into signing a \ndocument. Able holds out a piece of paper for her boss and points to the signature line, saying, “This is a \nreceipt for goods we received a little while ago.” Baker signs it. It is not a receipt; it’s the signature line on \na promissory note. Able has committed fraud in the execution, and the note is void. \n \nDischarge of Which the Holder Has Notice \nIf the holder knows that the paper—a note, say—has already been paid, she cannot enforce it. That’s a \ngood reason to take back any note you have made from the person who presents it to you for payment. \n \nConsumer Transactions and Holders in Due Course \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine often worked considerable hardship on the consumer, usually as the \nmaker of an installment note. \n \nFor example, a number of students are approached by a gym owner who induces them to sign one-year \npromissory notes for $150 for a one-year gym membership. The owner says, “I know that right now the \nequipment in the gym is pretty rudimentary, but then, too, $150 is about half what you’d pay at the YMCA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n866 \nor Gold’s Gym. And the thing is, as we get more customers signing up, we’re going to use the money to \ninvest in new equipment. So within several months we’ll have a fully equipped facility for your use.” \nSeveral students sign the notes, which the owner sells to a factor (one that lends money to another, \ntaking back a negotiable instrument as security, usually at about a 20 percent discount). The factor takes \nas an apparent HDC, but the gym idea doesn’t work and the owner declares bankruptcy. If this were a \ncommercial transaction, the makers (the students) would still owe on the notes even if there was, as here, \na complete failure of consideration (called “paying on a dead horse”). But the students don’t have to pay. \n \nWhether the gym owner here committed fraud is uncertain, but the holder-in-due-course doctrine did \noften work to promote fraud. Courts frequently saw cases brought by credit companies (factors) against \nconsumers who bought machines that did not work and services that did not live up to their promises. The \nancient concept of an HDC did not square with the realities of modern commerce, in which instruments \nby the millions are negotiated for uncompleted transactions. The finance company that bought such \ncommercial paper could never have honestly claimed (in the sociological sense) to be wholly ignorant that \nmany makers will have claims against their payees (though they could and did make the claim in the legal \nsense). \n \nActing to curb abuses, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1976 promulgated a trade regulation rule \nthat in effect abolished the holder-in-due-course rule for consumer credit transactions. Under the FTC \nrule titled “Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses,” [3] the creditor becomes a mere holder and \nstands in the shoes of the seller, subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the \nseller. Specifically, the rule requires the seller to provide notice in any consumer credit contract that the",

App. 1999) \n \nLytton, J. \n \nFacts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n869 \nOmni purchased some grain from Country Grain, and on February 2, 1996, it issued two checks, totaling \n$75,000, to Country Grain. Country Grain, in turn, endorsed the checks over to Carter as a retainer for \nfuture legal services. Carter deposited the checks on February 5; Country Grain failed the next day. On \nFebruary 8, Carter was notified that Omni had stopped payment on the checks. Carter subsequently filed \na complaint against Omni…alleging that it was entitled to the proceeds of the checks, plus pre-judgment \ninterest, as a holder in due course.…[Carter moved for summary judgment; the motion was denied.] \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nCarter argues that its motion for summary judgment should have been granted because, as a holder in due \ncourse, it has the right to recover on the checks from the drawer, Omni. \n \nThe Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) defines a holder in due course as: \n“the holder of an instrument if: \n \n(1) the instrument when issued does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is \nnot otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity, and (2) the \nholder took the instrument (i) for value,… \n \nSection 3-303(a) of the UCC also states that: \n \n(a) “An instrument is issued or transferred for value if: (1) the instrument is issued or transferred \nfor a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed * * *.” \n(emphasis added) \n \nCarter contends that in Illinois a contract for future legal services should be treated differently than other \nexecutory contracts. It contends that when the attorney-client relationship is created by payment of a fee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n870 \nor retainer, the contract is no longer executory. Thus, Carter would achieve holder in due course status. \nWe are not persuaded. \n \nA retainer is the act of a client employing an attorney; it also denotes the fee paid by the client when he \nretains the attorney to act for him. [Citation] We have found no Illinois cases construing section 3-303(a) \nas it relates to a promise to perform future legal services under a retainer. The general rule, however, is \nthat “an executory promise is not value.” [Citation] “[T]he promise does not rise to the level of ‘value’ in \nthe commercial paper market until it is actually performed.” [Citation] \n \nThe UCC comment to section 303 gives the following example: \n \n“Case # 2. X issues a check to Y in consideration of Y’s promise to perform services in the future. Although \nthe executory promise is consideration for issuance of the check it is value only to the extent the promise \nis performed. \n \nWe have found no exceptions to these principles for retainers. Indeed, courts in other jurisdictions \ninterpreting similar language under section 3-303 have held that attorneys may be holders in due course \nonly to the extent that they have actually performed legal services prior to acquiring a negotiable \ninstrument. See [Citations: Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts]. We agree. \n \nThis retainer was a contract for future legal services. Under section 3-303(a)(1), it was a “promise of \nperformance,” not yet performed. Thus, no value was received, and Carter is not a holder in due course. \n \nFurthermore, in this case, no evidence was presented in the trial court that Carter performed any legal \nservices for Country Grain prior to receiving the checks. Without an evidentiary basis for finding that \nCarter received the checks for services performed, the trial court correctly found that Carter failed to \nprove that it was a holder in due course. [Citations] \n \nConclusion \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n871 \nBecause we have decided that Carter did not take the checks for value under section 3-303(a) of the UCC, \nwe need not address its other arguments. \n \nThe judgment of the circuit court of Peoria County is affirmed. \n \nHoldridge, J., dissenting. \nI respectfully dissent. In a contractual relationship between attorney and client, the payment of a fee or \nretainer creates the relationship, and once that relationship is created the contract is no longer executory. \n[Citation] Carter’s agreement to enter into an attorney-client relationship with Country Grain was the \nvalue exchanged for the checks endorsed over to the firm. Thus, the general rule cited by the majority that \n“an executory promise is not value” does not apply to the case at bar. On that basis I would hold that the \ntrial court erred in determining that Carter was not entitled to the check proceeds and I therefore dissent. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. How did Carter & Grimsley obtain the two checks drawn by Omni? \n2. Why—apparently—did Omni stop payments on the checks? \n3. Why did the court determine that Carter was not an HDC?",

(ADP) to provide payroll services and a \nfacsimile signature was utilized on all Hauser Co. payroll checks. \n \nMr. Hauser executed affidavits of stolen and forged checks at the Bank, stopping payment on the checks at \nissue. Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn. All eighteen checks bore a red and green facsimile drawer’s signature stamp in the name of \nAlfred M. Hauser. All eighteen checks were marked by the Bank as “stolen check” and stamped with the \nwarning, “do not present again.”… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n878 \n \nPlaintiff then filed this action against the Bank, Hauser Co.,…Plaintiff contended that Hauser Co. was \nnegligent in failing to safeguard both its payroll checks and its authorized drawer’s facsimile stamp, and \nwas liable for payment of the checks. \n \nThe trial court granted plaintiff’s summary judgment motion, concluding that no genuine issue of fact \nexisted as to the authenticity of the eighteen checks at issue. Judge Hoens concluded that because the \ncheck cashing companies took the checks in good faith, plaintiff was a holder in due course as assignee. \nJudge Hoens also found that because the checks appeared to be genuine, Hauser Co. was required, but \nhad failed, to show that plaintiff’s assignor had any notice that the checks were not validly drawn.… \n \nHauser Co. argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because the court failed to properly \naddress Hauser Co.’s defense that the checks at issue were invalid negotiable instruments and therefore \nerred in finding plaintiff was a holder in due course. \n \nAs a threshold matter, it is evident that the eighteen checks meet the definition of a negotiable instrument \n[UCC 3-104]. Each check is payable to a bearer for a fixed amount, on demand, and does not state any \nother undertaking by the person promising payment, aside from the payment of money. In addition, each \ncheck appears to have been signed by Mr. Hauser, through the use of a facsimile stamp, permitted by the \nUCC to take the place of a manual signature. [Section 3-401(b) of the UCC] provides that a “signature may \nbe made manually or by means of a device or machine…with present intention to authenticate a writing.” \nIt is uncontroverted by Hauser Co. that the facsimile signature stamp on the checks is identical to Hauser \nCo.’s authorized stamp. \n \nHauser Co., however, contends that the checks are not negotiable instruments because Mr. Hauser did not \nsign the checks, did not authorize their signing, and its payroll service, ADP, did not produce the checks. \nLack of authorization, however, is a separate issue from whether the checks are negotiable instruments. \nConsequently, given that the checks are negotiable instruments, the next issue is whether the checks are \nunenforceable by a holder in due course, because the signature on the checks was forged or unauthorized. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n879 \n \n[Sections 3-203 and 3-302 of the UCC] discuss the rights of a holder in due course and the rights of a \ntransferee of a holder in due course. Section 3-302 establishes that a person is a holder in due course if: \n \n(1) the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence \nof forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its \nauthenticity; and \n(2) the holder took the instrument for value, in good faith, without notice that the instrument is \noverdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of \nanother instrument issued as part of the same series, without notice that the instrument contains \nan unauthorized signature or has been altered, without notice of any claim to the instrument \ndescribed in 3-306, and without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment \ndescribed in subsection a. of 3-305. \n \n \n \nSection 3-203 deals with transfer of instruments and provides: \n \na.

Companies should use checks uniquely designed \nand manufactured for them, or buy from vendors such as SAFEChecks \n(http://www.safechecks.com) that customize every company’s check and never sells check \nstock entirely blank without it first being customized for the end user.[1] \n \n  \n \n[1] Frank Abagnale and Greg Litster, Holder in Due Course and Check Fraud, TransactionDirectory.com. \n \n \n \n21.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nA holder is a holder in due course (HDC) if he takes the instrument without reason to question its \nauthenticity on account of obvious facial irregularities, for value, in good faith, and without notice that it \nis overdue or has been dishonored, or that it contains a forgery or alteration, or that that any person has \nany defense against it or claim to it. The HDC takes the paper free of most defenses; an ordinary holder \ntakes the paper as an assignee, acquiring only the rights of the assignor. \n \nValue is not the same as consideration; hence, a promise will not satisfy this criterion until it has been \nperformed. The HDC must have given something of value other than a promise to give. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n884 \nGood faith means (1) honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned and (2) the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. Honesty in fact is a subjective test, but the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards is objective. \n \nNotice is not limited to receipt of an explicit statement of defenses; a holder may be given notice through \ninferences that should be drawn from the character of the instrument. Thus an incomplete instrument, \none that bears marks of forgery, or one that indicates it is overdue may give notice on its face. Certain \nfacts do not necessarily give notice of defense or claim: that the instrument is antedated or postdated, that \nthe instrument was negotiated in return for an executory promise, that any party has signed for \naccommodation, that an incomplete instrument has been completed, that any person negotiating the \ninstrument is or was a fiduciary, or that there has been default in payment of interest or principal. \nA person who could not have become an HDC directly (e.g., because he had notice of a defense or claim) \nmay become so if he takes as transferee from an HDC as long as he was not a party to any fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument or had not previously been a holder with notice of a defense or claim. \nThis is the shelter rule. \n \nHolders in due course are not immune from all defenses. A real, as opposed to a personal, defense may be \nasserted against the HDC. Personal defenses include fraud in the inducement, failure of consideration, \nnonperformance of a condition precedent, and the like. Real defenses consist of infancy, acts that would \nmake a contract void (such as duress), fraud in the execution, forgery, and discharge in bankruptcy. A \n1976 trade regulation rule of the Federal Trade Commission abolishes the holder-in-due-course rule for \nconsumer transactions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Mike signed and delivered a note for $9,000 to Paul Payee in exchange for Paul’s tractor. Paul transferred \nthe note to Hilda, who promised to pay $7,500 for it. After Hilda had paid Paul $5,000 of the promised \n$7,500, Hilda learned that Mike had a defense: the tractor was defective. How much, if anything, can Hilda \ncollect from Mike on the note, and why? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n885 \n2. In Exercise 1, if Hilda had paid Paul $7,500 and then learned of Mike’s defense, how much—if any of the \namount—could she collect from Mike? \n3. Tex fraudulently sold a boat, to which he did not have title, to Sheryl for $30,000 and received, as a deposit \nfrom her, a check in the amount of $5,000. He deposited the check in his account at First Bank and \nimmediately withdrew $3,000 of the proceeds. When Sheryl discovered that Tex had no title, she called her \nbank (the drawee) and stopped payment on the check. Tex, in the meantime, disappeared. First Bank now \nwishes to collect the $3,000 from Sheryl, but she claims it is not an HDC because it did not give value for the \ncheck in that the payment to Tex was conditional: the bank retained the right to collect from Tex if it could \nnot collect on the check. Is Sheryl correct? Explain. \n4. Corporation draws a check payable to First Bank. The check is given to an officer of Corporation (known to \nBank), who is instructed to deliver it to Bank in payment of a debt owed by Corporation to Bank. Instead, \nthe officer, intending to defraud Corporation, delivers the check to Bank in payment of his personal debt. \nBank has received funds of Corporation that have been used for the personal benefit of the officer. \nCorporation asserts a claim to the proceeds of the check against Bank.

However, discharge does not operate if the payment is made in bad faith to one who \nunlawfully obtained the instrument (and UCC Section 3-602(b) lists two other exceptions). \n \n \n \nDischarge by Tender \nA person who tenders full payment to a holder on or after the date due discharges any subsequent liability \nto pay interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees (but not liability for the face amount of the instrument). If the \nholder refuses to accept the tender, any party who would have had a right of recourse against the party \nmaking the tender is discharged. Mario makes a note payable to Carol, who indorses it to Ed. On the date \nthe payment is due, Mario (the maker) tenders payment to Ed, who refuses to accept the payment; he \nwould rather collect from Carol. Carol is discharged: had she been forced to pay as indorser in the event of \nMario’s refusal, she could have looked to him for recourse. Since Mario did tender, Ed can no longer look \nto Carol for payment. [1] \n \nDischarge by Cancellation and Renunciation \nThe holder may discharge any party, even without consideration, by marking the face of the instrument or \nthe indorsement in an unequivocal way, as, for example, by intentionally canceling the instrument or the \nsignature by destruction or mutilation or by striking out the party’s signature. The holder may also \nrenounce his rights by delivering a signed writing to that effect or by surrendering the instrument itself. [2] \n \nDischarge by Material and Fraudulent Alteration \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n909 \nUnder UCC Section 3-407, if a holder materially and fraudulently alters an instrument, any party whose \ncontract is affected by the change is discharged. A payor bank or drawee paying a fraudulently altered \ninstrument or a person taking it for value, in good faith, and without notice of the alteration, may enforce \nrights with respect to the instrument according to its original terms or, if the incomplete instrument was \naltered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed. \n• \nExample 1: Marcus makes a note for $100 payable to Pauline. Pauline fraudulently raises the \namount to $1,000 without Marcus’s negligence and negotiates it to Ned, who qualifies as a holder \nin due course (HDC). Marcus owes Ned $100. \n• \nExample 2: Charlene writes a check payable to Lumber Yard and gives it to Contractor to buy \nmaterial for a deck replacement. Contractor fills it in for $1,200: $1,000 for the decking and $200 \nfor his own unauthorized purposes. Lumber Yard, if innocent of any wrongdoing, could enforce \nthe check for $1,200, and Charlene must go after Contractor for the $200. \n \nDischarge by Certification \nAs we have noted, where a drawee certifies a draft for a holder, the drawer and all prior indorsers are \ndischarged. \n \nDischarge by Acceptance Varying a Draft \nIf the holder assents to an acceptance varying the terms of a draft, the obligation of the drawer and any \nindorsers who do not expressly assent to the acceptance is discharged. [3] \n \nDischarge of Indorsers and Accommodation Parties \nThe liability of indorsers and accommodation parties is discharged under the following three \ncircumstances. [4] \n \nExtension of Due Date \nIf the holder agrees to an extension of the due date of the obligation of the obligor, the extension \ndischarges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the obligor to the extent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n910 \nthe indorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused her loss with respect to the right of \nrecourse. \n \nMaterial Modification of Obligation \nIf the holder agrees to a material modification of the obligor’s obligation, other than an extension of the \ndue date, the modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right \nof recourse against the obligor to the extent the modification causes her loss with respect to the right of \nrecourse. \n \n \nImpairment of Collateral \nIf the obligor’s duty to pay is secured by an interest in collateral and the holder impairs the value of the \ninterest in collateral, the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse \nagainst the obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment. \n \nThe following explanatory paragraph from UCC Section 3-605, Official Comment 1, may be helpful: \nBank lends $10,000 to Borrower who signs a note under which she (in suretyship law, the \n“Principal Debtor”) agrees to pay Bank on a date stated.

[Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card. Under the agreement’s terms, Martin agreed to bind himself to the \nagreement by signing the signature card. Martin does not dispute that the account agreement was a \nbinding contract, and he does not dispute the account agreement’s terms. \n \nMartin’s account agreement authorized PNC to charge Martin’s account for the value of any item returned \nto PNC unpaid or any item on which PNC did not receive payment. If PNC’s charge-back created an \noverdraft, Martin was required to pay PNC the amount of the overdraft immediately. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n929 \nThe scam of which Martin was a victim falls squarely within the charge-back provision of the account \nagreement. The check was returned to PNC unpaid. PNC charged Martin’s account, leaving it with an \noverdraft. Martin was obliged to pay PNC immediately. \n \nAs with the breach-of-transfer-warranties claim, Martin cannot defend against the breach-of-contract \nclaim by arguing that PNC made a mistake. The account agreement authorized PNC to charge back \nMartin’s account “even if the amount of the item has already been made available to you.” The account \nagreement, as a result, placed the risk of loss on Martin. Any mistake on PNC’s part was immaterial \nbecause PNC always had the right to charge back Martin’s account. [Citation] \n \nC. Martin’s Counterclaims \nMartin has asserted counterclaims for violations of various Uniform Commercial Code provisions; \nnegligence and failure to exercise ordinary care; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; detrimental reliance; conversion; and \nnegligent retention and supervision. Martin argues that “[t]o the extent that either party should be \nentitled to summary judgment in this case, it would be Martin with respect to his counterclaims against \nPNC.” Martin, however, has not moved for summary judgment on his counterclaims, and the court does \nnot address them on PNC’s motion. \n \nD. Damages \nPNC’s recovery under both theories of liability is contingent on PNC’s demonstrating that it acted in good \nfaith. PNC may recover for breach of the transfer warranties only if it took the check in good faith. § 3-\n416(b). Moreover, PNC must satisfy the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which Kentucky \nlaw incorporates in the account agreement. [Citation] Good faith, under both theories, means honesty in \nfact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. That means “contracts impose \non the parties thereto a duty to do everything necessary to carry them out.” [Citation] \n \nThe undisputed evidence establishes that PNC acted in good faith. PNC accepted deposit of Martin’s \ncheck, attempted to present the check for payment at First Century Bank, and charged back Martin’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n930 \naccount when the check was dishonored. Martin cannot claim that PNC lacked good faith and fair dealing \nwhen PNC took actions permitted under the contract. [Citation] Although PNC might have had the ability \nto investigate the authenticity of the check before crediting Martin’s account, PNC bore no such obligation \nbecause Martin warranted that the check was authentic. [UCC] § 3-416(a). Friedman’s and Jennewein’s \nstatements do not impute a lack of good faith to PNC, even if Martin could support the statements with \ncompetent evidence. The Uniform Commercial Code and the account agreement place the risk of loss on \nMartin, even if PNC made a mistake. \n \nMartin suggests that an insurance carrier might have already reimbursed PNC for the loss. Martin, \nhowever, presents no evidence of reimbursement, which PNC, presumably, would have disclosed in \ndiscovery. \n \nPNC, therefore, may recover from Martin the overdraft value of $124,313.01, which is the loss PNC \nsuffered as a result of Martin’s breach of the transfer warranties and breach of contract.

Is a reader really constrained here to say that Mr. Martin got totally scammed, or was his behavior \nreasonable under the circumstances? \n \n  \n \n[1] Section 4-208 provides as follows: “(a) If an unaccepted draft is presented [in this case, by BOK] to the drawee \n[BNH] for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft,(i) the person obtaining payment or \nacceptance, at the time of presentment, and(ii) a previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant \nto the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in good faith, that:(1) The warrantor is, or was, at the time the \nwarrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or \nacceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft;(2) The draft has not been altered; \nand(3) The warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the purported drawer of the draft is unauthorized.(b) \nA drawee making payment may recover from a warrantor damages for breach of warranty.…(c) If a drawee asserts \na claim for breach of warranty under subsection (a) of this section based on an unauthorized indorsement of the \ndraft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that…the drawer [here, Farm Bureau] is \nprecluded under Section 3-406 or 4-406 of this title from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized \nindorsement or alteration.” \n[2] (a) A person whose failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to an alteration of an instrument \nor to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting the alteration or the forgery \nagainst a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection. \n[3] The parties do not address Section 3-406(b), which states that the person asserting preclusion may be held \npartially liable under comparative negligence principles for failing to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the \ncheck. They also do not address any possible negligence by either bank in accepting the forged check without \nconfirming the legitimacy of Conseco’s indorsement. \n[4] Petitioner’s choice could be viewed as an attempt at risk shifting. Petitioner, an attorney, may have known that \nhe could have suffered a fee charged by his own bank if he deposited a check into his own account and then the \nbank on which it was drawn returned it for insufficient funds, forged endorsement, alteration, or the like. \nPetitioner’s action, viewed against that backdrop, would operate as a risk-shifting strategy, electing to avoid the \nrisk of a returned-check fee by presenting in person the check for acceptance at the drawee bank. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n932 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n22.6 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nAs a general rule, one who signs a note as maker or a draft as drawer is personally liable unless he or she \nsigns in a representative capacity and either the instrument or the signature shows that the signing has \nbeen made in a representative capacity. Various rules govern the permutations of signatures when an \nagent and a principal are involved. \n \nThe maker of a note and the acceptor of a draft have primary contract liability on the instruments. \nSecondarily liable are drawers and indorsers. Conditions precedent to secondary liability are presentment, \ndishonor, and notice of dishonor. Under the proper circumstances, any of these conditions may be waived \nor excused. \n \nPresentment is a demand for payment made on the maker, acceptor, or drawee, or a demand for \nacceptance on the drawee. Presentment must be made (1) at the time specified in the instrument unless \nno time is specified, in which case it must be at the time specified for payment, or (2) within a reasonable \ntime if a sight instrument. \n \nDishonor occurs when acceptance or payment is refused after presentment, at which time a holder has the \nright of recourse against secondary parties if he has given proper notice of dishonor.",

Although histories of banking dwell on the relationship between \nbanks and the national government, the banking law that governs the daily operation of checking \naccounts is state based—Article 4 of the UCC. The enormous increase in noncheck banking has given \nrise to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, a federal law. \n \n \n \n \n \n23.1 Banks and Their Customers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how checks move, both traditionally and electronically. \n2. Know how Article 4 governs the relationship between a bank and its customers. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n939 \n \n \nThe Traditional Bank Collection Process \nThe Traditional System in General \nOnce people mostly paid for things with cash: actual bills. That is obviously not very convenient or safe: a \nlost ten-dollar bill is almost certainly gone, and carrying around large quantities of cash is dangerous \n(probably only crooks do much of that). Today a person might go for weeks without reaching for a bill \n(except maybe to get change for coins to put in the parking meter). And while it is indisputable that \nelectronic payment is replacing paper payment, the latter is still very significant. Here is an excerpt from a \nFederal Reserve Report on the issue: \n \nIn 2008, U.S. consumers had more payment instruments to choose from than ever before: four \ntypes of paper instruments—cash, check, money order, and travelers checks; three types of \npayment cards—debit, credit, and prepaid; and two electronic instruments—online banking bill \npayment (OBBP) and electronic bank account deductions (EBAD) using their bank account \nnumbers. The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card. More consumers now have debit cards than credit cards (80.2 percent versus 78.3 \npercent), and consumers use debit cards more often than cash, credit cards, or checks \nindividually. However, paper instruments are still popular and account for 36.5 percent of \nconsumer payments. Most consumers have used newer electronic payments at some point, but \nthese only account for 9.7 percent of consumer payments. Security and ease of use are the \ncharacteristics of payment instruments that consumers rate as most important. [1] \n \nAmericans still wrote some thirty billion checks in 2006. [2] You can readily imagine how complex the \nbank collection process must be to cope with such a flood of paper. Every check written must eventually \ncome back to the bank on which it is drawn, after first having been sent to the landlord, say, to pay rent, \nthen to the landlord’s bank, and from there through a series of intermediate banks and collection centers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n940 \nTerminology \nTo trace the traditional check-collection process, it is necessary to understand the terminology used. The \nbank upon which a check is written is the payor bank (the drawee bank). The depository bank is the \none the payee deposits the check into. Two terms are used to describe the various banks that may handle \nthe check after it is written: collecting banks and intermediary banks. All banks that handle the check—\nexcept the payor bank—are collecting banks (including the depository \nbank); intermediary banks are all the collecting banks except the payor and depository banks. A bank \ncan take on more than one role: Roger in Seattle writes a check on his account at Seattle Bank and mails it \nto Julia in Los Angeles in payment for merchandise; Julia deposits it in her account at Bank of L.A. Bank \nof L.A. is a depository bank and a collecting bank. Any other bank through which the check travels (except \nthe two banks already mentioned) is an intermediary bank. \n \nCollection Process between Customers of the Same Bank \nIf the depository bank is also the payor bank (about 30% of all checks), the check is called an “on-us” item \nand UCC 4-215(e)(2) provides that—if the check is not dishonored—it is available by the payee “at the \nopening of the bank’s second banking day following receipt of the item.” Roger writes a check to Matthew, \nboth of whom have accounts at Seattle Bank; Matthew deposits the check on Monday. On Wednesday the \ncheck is good for Matthew (he may have been given “provisional credit” before then, as discussed below, \nthe bank could subtract the money from his account if Roger didn’t have enough to cover the check). \n \nCollection Process between Customers of Different Banks \nRoger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. Julia deposits it in her account at \nL.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank must somehow present the check to Seattle Bank either directly \nor through intermediary banks.

When the \npayor bank—Seattle Bank—gets the check it must pay it, unless the check is dishonored or returned (UCC \n4-302). \n \nPhysical Movement of Checks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n941 \nThe physical movement of checks—such as it still occurs—is handled by three possible systems. \n \nThe Federal Reserve System’s regional branches process checks for banks holding accounts with them. \nThe Feds charge for the service, and prior to 2004 it regularly included check collection, air \ntransportation of checks to the Reserve Bank (hired out to private contractors) and ground transportation \ndelivery of checks to paying banks. Reserve Banks handle about 27 percent of US checks, but the air \nservice is decreasing with “Check 21,” a federal law discussed below, that allows electronic transmission of \nchecks. \n \nCorrespondent banks are banks that have formed “partnerships” with other banks in order to \nexchange checks and payments directly, bypassing the Federal Reserve and its fees. Outside banks may go \nthrough a correspondent bank to exchange checks and payments with one of its partners. \n \nCorrespondent banks may also form a clearinghouse corporation, in which members exchange \nchecks and payments in bulk, instead of on a check-by-check basis, which can be inefficient considering \nthat each bank might receive thousands of checks in a day. The clearinghouse banks save up the checks \ndrawn on other members and exchange them on a daily basis. The net payments for these checks are often \nsettled through Fedwire, a Federal Reserve Board electronic funds transfer (EFT) system that handles \nlarge-scale check settlement among US banks. Correspondent banks and clearinghouse corporations \nmake up the private sector of check clearing, and together they handle about 43 percent of US checks. \n \nThe Electronic System: Check 21 Act \nRationale for the “Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act” \nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, Congress felt with renewed urgency that banks needed to present \nand clear checks in a way not dependent upon the physical transportation of the paper instruments by air \nand ground, in case such transportation facilities were disrupted. The federal Check Clearing for the 21st \nCentury Act (Public Law 108-100)—more commonly referred to as “Check 21 Act”—became effective in \n2004. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n942 \nBasic Idea of Check 21 Act \nCheck 21 Act provides the legal basis for the electronic transportation of check data. A bank scans the \ncheck. The data on the check is already encoded in electronically readable numbers and the data, now \nseparated (“truncated”) from the paper instrument (which may be destroyed), is transmitted for \nprocessing. “The Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument, called a substitute check, to replace the \noriginal check. A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that is suitable for \nautomated processing in the same manner as the original check. The Act permits banks to provide \nsubstitute checks in place of original checks to subsequent parties in the check processing stream.…Any \nfinancial institution in the check clearing process can truncate the original check and create a substitute \ncheck. [3] However, in the check collection process it is not required that the image be converted to a \nsubstitute check: the electronic image itself may suffice. \n \nFor example, suppose Roger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. and mails it \nto her. Julia deposits it in her account at L.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank truncates the check \n(again, scans it and destroys the original) and transmits the data to Seattle Bank for presentation and \npayment. If for any reason Roger, or any appropriate party, wants a paper version, a substitute check will \nbe created (see Figure 23.1 \"Substitute Check Front and Back\"). Most often, though, that is not necessary: \nRoger does not receive the actual cancelled checks he wrote in his monthly statement as he did formerly. \nHe receives instead a statement listing paid checks he’s written and a picture of the check (not a substitute \ncheck) is available to him online through his bank’s website. Or he may receive his monthly statement",

However, Article 4 answers several specific questions that bank customers most frequently ask. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n945 \n1. What is the effect of a “pay any bank” indorsement? The moment these words are indorsed on a \ncheck, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder. This restriction can be lifted whenever (a) the \ncheck has been returned to the customer initiating collection or (b) the bank specially indorses the \ncheck to a person who is not a bank (4-201). \n2. May a depositary bank supply a missing indorsement? It may supply any indorsement of the \ncustomer necessary to title unless the check contains words such as “payee’s indorsement required.” \nIf the customer fails to indorse a check when depositing it in his account, the bank’s notation that the \ncheck was deposited by a customer or credited to his account takes effect as the customer’s \nindorsement. (Section 4-205(1)). \n3. Are any warranties given in the collection process? Yes. They are identical to those provided in \nArticle 3, except that they apply only to customers and collecting banks (4-207(a)). The customer or \ncollecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants (1) \nhe is entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures are authorized authentic; (3) the item has not \nbeen altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment; (5) he has no knowledge \nof insolvency proceedings regarding the maker or acceptor or in the case of an unaccepted draft, the \ndrawer. These warranties cannot be disclaimed as to checks. \n4. Does the bank have the right to a charge-back against a customer’s account, or refund? The answer \nturns on whether the settlement was provisional or final. A settlement is the proper crediting of the \namount ordered to be paid by the instrument. Someone writes you a check for $1,000 drawn on First \nBank, and you deposit it in Second Bank. Second Bank will make a “provisional settlement” with \nyou—that is, it will provisionally credit your account with $1,000, and that settlement will be final \nwhen First Bank debits the check writer’s account and credits Second Bank with the funds. Under \nSection 4-212(1), as long as the settlement was still provisional, a collecting bank has the right to a \n“charge-back” or refund if the check “bounces” (is dishonored). However, if settlement was final, the \nbank cannot claim a refund. \n \nWhat determines whether settlement is provisional or final? Section 4-213(1) spells out four events \n(whichever comes first) that will convert a payor bank’s provisional settlement into final settlement: \nWhen it (a) pays the item in cash; (b) settles without reserving a right to revoke and without having a right \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n946 \nunder statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement with the customer; finishes posting the item to the \nappropriate account; or (d) makes provisional settlement and fails to revoke the settlement in the time \nand manner permitted by statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement.

For example an item cleared before 10 \na.m. may be returned and the settlement revoked before 2 p.m. From this section it should be apparent \nthat a bank generally can prevent a settlement from becoming final if it chooses to do so. \n \nRelationship with Customers \nThe relationship between a bank and its customers is governed by UCC Article 4. However, Section 4-\n103(1) permits the bank to vary its terms, except that no bank can disclaim responsibility for failing to act \nin good faith or to exercise ordinary care. Most disputes between bank and customer arise when the bank \neither pays or refuses to pay a check. Under several provisions of Article 4, the bank is entitled to pay, \neven though the payment may be adverse to the customer’s interest. \n \nCommon Issues Arising between Banks and Their Customers \nPayment of Overdrafts \nSuppose a customer writes a check for a sum greater than the amount in her account. May the bank pay \nthe check and charge the customer’s account? Under Section 4-401(1), it may. Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified.",

No checks change hands; no paper is written on. It is quiet, odorless, smudge proof. But errors \nare harder to trace than when a paper trail exists, and when the system fails (“our computer is down”) the \nfinancial mess can be colossal. Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows. \n \n1. Proof of transaction. The electronic terminal itself must be equipped to provide a receipt of transfer, \nshowing date, amount, account number, and certain other information. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe bank or other financial institution must provide you with a monthly statement listing all \nelectronic transfers to and from the account, including transactions made over the computer or \ntelephone, and must show to whom payment has been made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n954 \n2. Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation.",

In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and \nSupplies Ltd. is still the beneficiary.

The usual practice is for banks and their \ncustomers to agree to security procedures for the verification of payment orders. If a bank establishes a \ncommercially reasonable procedure, complies with that procedure, and acts in good faith and according to \nits agreement with the customer, the customer is bound by an unauthorized payment order. There is, \nhowever, an important exception to this rule. A customer will not be liable when the order is from a \nperson unrelated to its business operations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n960 \nError by Sender \nSecond, who is responsible when the sender makes a mistake—for instance, in instructing payment \ngreater than what was intended? The general rule is that the sender is bound by its own error. But in cases \nwhere the error would have been discovered had the bank complied with its security procedure, the \nreceiving bank is liable for the excess over the amount intended by the sender, although the bank is \nallowed to recover this amount from the beneficiary. \n \nBank Mistake in Transferring Funds \nThird, what are the consequences when the bank makes a mistake in transferring funds? Suppose, for \nexample, that Widgets (in the previous situation) instructed payment of $2 million but First Bank in turn \ninstructed payment of $20 million. First Bank would be entitled to only $2 million from Widgets and \nwould then attempt to recover the remaining $18 million from Supplies Ltd. If First Bank had instructed \npayment to the wrong beneficiary, Widgets would have no liability and the bank would be responsible for \nrecovering the entire payment. Unless the parties agree otherwise, however, a bank that improperly \nexecutes a payment order is not liable for consequential damages. \n \nLetters of Credit \nBecause international trade involves risks not usually encountered in domestic trade—government control \nof exports, imports, and currency; problems in verifying goods’ quality and quantity; disruptions caused \nby adverse weather, war; and so on—merchants have over the years devised means to minimize these \nrisks, most notably the letter of credit (“LC”). Here are discussed the definition of letters of credit, the \nsource of law governing them, how they work as payments for exports and as payments for imports. \n \nDefinition \nA letter of credit is a statement by a bank (or other financial institution) that it will pay a specified sum \nof money to specific persons if certain conditions are met. Or, to rephrase, it is a letter issued by a bank \nauthorizing the bearer to draw a stated amount of money from the issuing bank (or its branches, or other \nassociated banks or agencies). Originally, a letter of credit was quite literally that—a letter addressed by \nthe buyer’s bank to the seller’s bank stating that the former could vouch for their good customer, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n961 \nbuyer, and that it would pay the seller in case of the buyer’s default. An LC is issued by a bank on behalf of \nits creditworthy customers, whose application for the credit has been approved by that bank. \n \nSource of Law \nLetters of credit are governed by both international and US domestic law. \n \nInternational Law \nMany countries (including the United States) have bodies of law governing letters of credit. Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce.

The usual practice is for banks and their customers to agree to security procedures for the verification of payment orders.

There is, however, an important exception to this rule. A customer will not be liable when the order is from a person unrelated to its business operations.

Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce. Suppose the parties do not stipulate a body of law for the agreement, and the \nvarious bodies of law conflict, what then? Julius is in New York and Rochelle is in Paris; does French law \nor New York law govern? The answer will depend on the particulars of the dispute. An American court \nmust determine under the applicable principles of the law of “conflicts of law” whether New York or \nFrench law applies. \n \nDomestic Law \nThe principal body of law applicable to the letter of credit in the United States is Article 5 of the UCC. \nSection 5-103 declares that Article 5 “applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations \narising out of transactions involving letters of credit.” The Official Comment to 5-101 observes, “A letter of \ncredit is an idiosyncratic form of undertaking that supports performance of an obligation incurred in a \nseparate financial, mercantile, or other transaction or arrangement.” And—as is the case in other parts of \nthe Code—parties may, within some limits, agree to “variation by agreement in order to respond to and \naccommodate developments in custom and usage that are not inconsistent with the essential definitions \nand mandates of the statute.” Although detailed consideration of Article 5 is beyond the scope of this \nbook, a distinction between guarantees and letters of credit should be noted: Article 5 applies to the latter \nand not the former. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n962 \nLetters of Credit as Payment for Exports \nThe following discussion presents how letters of credit work as payment for exports, and a sample letter of \ncredit is presented at Figure 23.4 \"A Letter of Credit\". \n \nFigure 23.4 A Letter of Credit \n \nJulius desires to sell fine quality magic wands and other stage props to Rochelle’s Gallery in Paris. \nRochelle agrees to pay by letter of credit—she will, in effect, get her bank to inform Julius that he will get \npaid if the goods are right. She does so by “opening” a letter of credit at her bank—the issuing bank—the \nBanque de Rue de Houdini where she has funds in her account, or good credit. She tells the bank the \nterms of sale, the nature and quantity of the goods, the amount to be paid, the documents she will require \nas proof of shipment, and an expiration date. Banque de Rue de Houdini then directs its correspondent \nbank in the United States, First Excelsior Bank, to inform Julius that the letter of credit has been opened: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n963 \nRochelle is good for it. For Julius to have the strongest guarantee that he will be paid, Banque de Rou de \nHoudini can ask First Excelsior to confirm the letter of credit, thus binding both Banque de Rue de \nHoudini and Excelsior to pay according to the terms of the letter. \n \nOnce Julius is informed that the letter of credit has been issued and confirmed, he can proceed to ship the \ngoods and draw a draft to present (along with the required documents such as commercial invoice, bill of \nlading, and insurance policy) to First Excelsior, which is bound to follow exactly its instructions from \nBanque de Rue de Houdini. Julius can present the draft and documents directly, through correspondent \nbanks, or by a representative at the port from which he is shipping the goods. On presentation, First \nExcelsior may forward the documents to Banque de Rue de Houdini for approval and when First Excelsior \nis satisfied it will take the draft and pay Julius immediately on a sight draft or will stamp the draft \n“accepted” if it is a time draft (payable in thirty, sixty, or ninety days). Julius can discount an accepted \ntime draft or hold it until it matures and cash it in for the full amount.

Section 5-103 declares that Article 5 “applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations arising out of transactions involving letters of credit.” The Official Comment to 5-101 observes, “A letter of credit is an idiosyncratic form of undertaking that supports performance of an obligation incurred in a separate financial, mercantile, or other transaction or arrangement.” And—as is the case in other parts of the Code—parties may, within some limits, agree to “variation by agreement in order to respond to and accommodate developments in custom and usage that are not inconsistent with the essential definitions and mandates of the statute.” Although detailed consideration of Article 5 is beyond the scope of this book, a distinction between guarantees and letters of credit should be noted: Article 5 applies to the latter and not the former."

How consumers enter into credit transactions and what protections they are afforded when they do \n2. What rights consumers have after they have entered into a consumer transaction \n3. What debt collection practices third-party collectors may pursue \n \n \nThis chapter and the three that follow are devoted to debtor-creditor relations.

Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" and Chapter 26 \n\"Mortgages and Nonconsensual Liens\" explore different types of security that a creditor might \nrequire. Chapter 27 \"Bankruptcy\" examines debtors’ and creditors’ rights under bankruptcy law. \n \nThe amount of consumer debt, or household debt, owed by Americans to mortgage lenders, stores, \nautomobile dealers, and other merchants who sell on credit is difficult to ascertain. One reads that the \naverage household credit card debt (not including mortgages, auto loans, and student loans) in 2009 was \nalmost $16,000. [1] Or maybe it was $10,000. [2] Or maybe it was $7,300. [3]But probably focusing on \nthe average household debt is not very helpful: 55 percent of households have no credit card debt at all, \nand the median debt is $1,900.

Moreover, certain charges are not considered interest, such as fees to record \ndocuments in a public office and charges for services such as title examinations, deed preparation, credit \nreports, appraisals, and loan processing. But a creditor may not use these devices to cloak what is in fact a \nusurious bargain; it is not the form but the substance of the agreement that controls. \n \nAs suggested, part of the difficulty here is that governments at all levels have for a generation attempted to \npromote consumption to promote production; production is required to maintain politically acceptable \nlevels of employment. If consumers can get what they want on credit, consumerism increases. Also, \ncertainly, tight limits on interest rates cause creditors to deny credit to the less creditworthy, which may \nnot be helpful to the lower classes. That’s the rationale for the usury exceptions related to pawnshop and \npayday loans. \n \n \nDisclosure of Credit Costs \nSetting limits on what credit costs—as usury laws do—is one thing. Disclosing the cost of credit is another. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act \nUntil 1969, lenders were generally free to disclose the cost of money loaned or credit extended in any way \nthey saw fit—and they did. Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why? Because with the first loan you will have the use of the full \n$1,000 for the entire year; with the second, for much less than the year because you must begin repaying \npart of the principal within a month. In fact, with the second loan you will have use of only about half the \nmoney for the entire year, and so the actual rate of interest is closer to 15 percent. Things become more \ncomplex when interest is compounded and stated as a monthly figure, when different rates apply to \nvarious portions of the loan, and when processing charges and other fees are stated separately. The act \nregulates open-end credit (revolving credit, like charge cards) and closed-end credit (like a car loan—\nextending for a specific period), and—as amended later—it regulates consumer leases and credit card \ntransactions, too. \nFigure 24.1 Credit Disclosure Form \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n990 \n \n \nBy requiring that the finance charge and the annual percentage rate be disclosed on a uniform basis, the \nTILA makes understanding and comparison of loans much easier. The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are",

Because \ncredit is such a big business, a number of support industries have grown up around it. One of the most \nimportant is the credit-reporting industry, which addresses this issue of checking creditworthiness. \nCertain companies—credit bureaus—collect information about borrowers, holders of credit cards, store \naccounts, and installment purchasers. For a fee, this information—currently held on tens of millions of \nAmericans—is sold to companies anxious to know whether applicants are creditworthy. If the information \nis inaccurate, it can lead to rejection of a credit application that should be approved, and it can wind up in \nother files where it can live to do more damage. In 1970, Congress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to give consumers access to their credit files in order \nto correct errors. \n \nUnder this statute, an applicant denied credit has the right to be told the name and address of the credit \nbureau (called “consumer reporting agency” in the act) that prepared the report on which the denial was \nbased. (The law covers reports used to screen insurance and job applicants as well as to determine \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n995 \ncreditworthiness.) The agency must list the nature and substance of the information (except medical \ninformation) and its sources (unless they contributed to an investigative-type report). A credit report lists \nsuch information as name, address, employer, salary history, loans outstanding, and the like. An \ninvestigative-type report is one that results from personal interviews and may contain nonfinancial \ninformation, like drinking and other personal habits, character, or participation in dangerous sports. \nSince the investigators rely on talks with neighbors and coworkers, their reports are usually subjective and \ncan often be misleading and inaccurate. \n \nThe agency must furnish the consumer the information free if requested within thirty days of rejection \nand must also specify the name and address of anyone who has received the report within the preceding \nsix months (two years if furnished for employment purposes). \n \nIf the information turns out to be inaccurate, the agency must correct its records; if investigative material \ncannot be verified, it must be removed from the file. Those to whom it was distributed must be notified of \nthe changes. When the agency and the consumer disagree about the validity of the information, the \nconsumer’s version must be placed in the file and included in future distributions of the report. After \nseven years, any adverse information must be removed (ten years in the case of bankruptcy). A person is \nentitled to one free copy of his or her credit report from each of the three main national credit bureaus \nevery twelve months. If a reporting agency fails to correct inaccurate information in a reasonable time, it \nis liable to the consumer for $1,000 plus attorneys’ fees. \n \nUnder the FCRA, any person who obtains information from a credit agency under false pretenses is \nsubject to criminal and civil penalties. The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. See Rodgers \nv. McCullough inSection 24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving use of information from a credit report. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCredit is an important part of the US economy, and there are various laws regulating its availability and \ndisclosure.

Understand that consumers have the right to cancel some purchases made on credit. \n2. Know how billing mistakes may be corrected. \n3. Recognize that professional debt collectors are governed by some laws restricting certain practices. \n \n \nCancellation Rights \nOrdinarily, a contract is binding when signed. But consumer protection laws sometimes provide an escape \nvalve. For example, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation gives consumers three days to cancel \ncontracts made with door-to-door salespersons. Under this cooling-off provision, the cancellation is \neffective if made by midnight of the third business day after the date of the purchase agreement. The \nsalesperson must notify consumers of this right and supply them with two copies of a cancellation form, \nand the sales agreement must contain a statement explaining the right. The purchaser cancels by \nreturning one copy of the cancellation form to the seller, who is obligated either to pick up the goods or to \npay shipping costs. The three-day cancellation privilege applies only to sales of twenty-five dollars or more \nmade either in the home or away from the seller’s place of business; it does not apply to sales made by \nmail or telephone, to emergency repairs and certain other home repairs, or to real estate, insurance, or \nsecurities sales. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act (TILA) protects consumers in a similar way. For certain big-ticket purchases \n(such as installations made in the course of major home improvements), sellers sometimes require a \nmortgage (which is subordinate to any preexisting mortgages) on the home. The law gives such customers \nthree days to rescind the contract. Many states have laws similar to the FTC’s three-day cooling-off period, \nand these may apply to transactions not covered by the federal rule (e.g., to purchases of less than twenty-\nfive dollars and even to certain contracts made at the seller’s place of business). \n \nCorrecting Billing Mistakes \nBilling Mistakes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n998 \nIn 1975, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Billing Act as an amendment to the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act. It was intended to put to an end the phenomenon, by then a standard part of any \ncomedian’s repertoire, of the many ways a computer could insist that you pay a bill, despite errors and \ndespite letters you might have written to complain. The act, which applies only to open-end credit and not \nto installment sales, sets out a procedure that creditors and customers must follow to rectify claimed \nerrors. The customer has sixty days to notify the creditor of the nature of the error and the amount. Errors \ncan include charges not incurred or those billed with the wrong description, charges for goods never \ndelivered, accounting or arithmetic errors, failure to credit payments or returns, and even charges for \nwhich you simply request additional information, including proof of sale. During the time the creditor is \nreplying, you need not pay the questioned item or any finance charge on the disputed amount. \n \nThe creditor has thirty days to respond and ninety days to correct your account or explain why your belief \nthat an error has been committed is incorrect. If you do turn out to be wrong, the creditor is entitled to all",

Failure of the \ncreditor to follow the rules, an explanation of which must be provided to each customer every six months \nand when a dispute arises, bars it from collecting the first fifty dollars in dispute, plus finance charges, \neven if the creditor turns out to be correct. \n \nDisputes about the Quality of Goods or Services Purchased \nWhile disputes over the quality of goods are not “billing errors,” the act does apply to unsatisfactory goods \nor services purchased by credit card (except for store credit cards); the customer may assert against the \ncredit card company any claims or defenses he or she may have against the seller. This means that under \ncertain circumstances, the customer may withhold payments without incurring additional finance \ncharges. However, this right is subject to three limitations: (1) the value of the goods or services charged \nmust be in excess of fifty dollars, (2) the goods or services must have been purchased either in the home \nstate or within one hundred miles of the customer’s current mailing address, and (3) the consumer must \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n999 \nmake a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute before refusing to pay. If the consumer does refuse to pay, \nthe credit card company would acquiesce: it would credit her account for the disputed amount, pass the \nloss down to the merchant’s bank, and that bank would debit the merchant’s account. The merchant \nwould then have to deal with the consumer directly. \n \n \nDebt Collection Practices \nBanks, financial institutions, and retailers have different incentives for extending credit—for some, a loan \nis simply a means of making money, and for others, it is an inducement to buyers. But in either case, \ncredit is a risk because the consumer may default; the creditor needs a means of collecting when the \ncustomer fails to pay. Open-end credit is usually given without collateral. The creditor can, of course, sue, \nbut if the consumer has no assets, collection can be troublesome. Historically, three different means of \nrecovering the debt have evolved: garnishment, wage assignment, and confession of judgment. \n \nGarnishment \nGarnishment is a legal process by which a creditor obtains a court order directing the debtor’s employer \n(or any party who owes money to the debtor) to pay directly to the creditor a certain portion of the \nemployee’s wages until the debt is paid. Until 1970, garnishment was regulated by state law, and its effects \ncould be devastating—in some cases, even leading to suicide. In 1970, Title III of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act asserted federal control over garnishment proceedings for the first time. The federal wage-\ngarnishment law limits the amount of employee earnings that may be withheld in any one pay date to the \nlesser of 25 percent of disposable (after-tax) earnings or the amount by which disposable weekly earnings \nexceed thirty times the highest current federal minimum wage. The federal law covers everyone who \nreceives personal earnings, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and retirement income \n(though not tips), but it allows courts to garnish above the federal maximum in cases involving support \npayments (e.g., alimony), in personal bankruptcy cases, and in cases where the debt owed is for state or \nfederal tax. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1000 \nThe federal wage-garnishment law also prohibits an employer from firing any worker solely because the \nworker’s pay has been garnished for one debt (multiple garnishments may be grounds for discharge). The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places",

The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought. In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional. [2] \n \nWage Assignment \nA wage assignment is an agreement by an employee that a creditor may take future wages as security \nfor a loan or to pay an existing debt. With a wage assignment, the creditor can collect directly from the \nemployer. However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977. \n \nThis law regulates the manner by which third-party collection agencies conduct their business. It covers \ncollection of all personal, family, and household debts by collection agencies. It does not deal with \ncollection by creditors themselves; the consumer’s remedy for abusive debt collection by the creditor is in \ntort law. \n \nUnder the FDCPA, the third-party collector may contact the debtor only during reasonable hours and not \nat work if the debtor’s employer prohibits it. The debtor may write the collector to cease contact, in which \ncase the agency is prohibited from further contact (except to confirm that there will be no further contact). \nA written denial that money is owed stops the bill collector for thirty days, and he can resume again only \nafter the debtor is sent proof of the debt. Collectors may no longer file suit in remote places, hoping for \ndefault judgments; any suit must be filed in a court where the debtor lives or where the underlying \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1002",

She notes that Mr. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1011 \nAnthony did not have custody of Meghan Rodgers and that an award of child support had not even been \nset at the time Ms. McCullough obtained her consumer report. \n \nDefendants maintain that Ms. McCullough obtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report for a permissible \npurpose, namely to locate Ms. Rodgers’ residence and set and collect child support obligations. \nDefendants argue that 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(a)(3)(A) permits the use of a credit report in connection with \n“collection of an account” and, therefore, Ms. McCullough was permitted to use Ms. Rodgers’ credit report \nin connection with the collection of child support. [1] \n \nThe cases Defendants have cited in response to the motion for summary judgment are inapplicable to the \npresent facts. In each case cited by Defendants, the person who obtained a credit report did so in order to \ncollect on an outstanding judgment or an outstanding debt. See, e.g., [Citation] (finding that collection of \na judgment of arrears in child support is a permissible purpose under [the act]; [Citation] (holding that \ndefendant had a permissible purpose for obtaining a consumer report where plaintiff owed an \noutstanding debt to the company). \n \nHowever, no such outstanding debt or judgment existed in this case. At the time Ms. McCullough \nobtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report, Ms. Rodgers’ did not owe money to either Ms. McCullough or her \nclient, Mr. Anthony. Defendants have provided no evidence showing that Ms. McCullough believed Ms. \nRodgers owed money to Mr. Anthony at the time she requested the credit report. Indeed, Mr. Anthony \nhad not even been awarded custody of Meghan Rodgers at the time Ms. McCullough obtained and used \nthe credit report. Ms. McCullough acknowledged each of the facts during her deposition. Moreover, in \nresponse to Plaintiff’s request for admissions, Ms. McCullough admitted that she did not receive the credit \nreport for the purpose of collecting on an account from Ms. Rodgers. \n \nThe evidence before the Court makes clear that Ms. McCullough was actually attempting, on behalf of Mr. \nAnthony, to secure custody of Meghan Rodgers and obtain a future award of child support payments from \nMs. Rodgers by portraying Ms. Rodgers as irresponsible to the court. These are not listed as permissible \npurposes under [FCRA]. Defendants have offered the Court no reason to depart from the plain language \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1012 \nof the statute, which clearly does not permit an individual to obtain a consumer report for the purposes of \nobtaining child custody and instituting child support payments.

Collateral is—again—property that \nis subject to the security interest. It can be divided into four broad categories: goods, intangible property, \nindispensable paper, and other types of collateral. \n \nGoods \nTangible property as collateral is goods. Goods means “all things that are movable when a security interest \nattaches. The term includes (i) fixtures, (ii) standing timber that is to be cut and removed under a \nconveyance or contract for sale, (iii) the unborn young of animals, (iv) crops grown, growing, or to be \ngrown, even if the crops are produced on trees, vines, or bushes, and (v) manufactured homes. The term \nalso includes a computer program embedded in goods.” [8] Goods are divided into several subcategories; \nsix are taken up here. \n \nConsumer Goods \nThese are “goods used or bought primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” [9] \n \nInventory \n“Goods, other than farm products, held by a person for sale or lease or consisting of raw materials, works \nin progress, or material consumed in a business.” [10] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1025 \n \nFarm Products \n“Crops, livestock, or other supplies produced or used in farming operations,” including aquatic goods \nproduced in aquaculture. [11] \n \nEquipment \nThis is the residual category, defined as “goods other than inventory, farm products, or consumer \ngoods.” [12] \n \nFixtures \nThese are “goods that have become so related to particular real property that an interest in them arises \nunder real property law.” [13] Examples would be windows, furnaces, central air conditioning, and \nplumbing fixtures—items that, if removed, would be a cause for significant reconstruction. \n \nAccession \nThese are “goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that the identity of the \noriginal goods is lost.” [14] A new engine installed in an old automobile is an accession. \n \nIntangible Property \nTwo types of collateral are neither goods nor indispensible paper: accounts and general intangibles. \n \nAccounts \nThis type of intangible property includes accounts receivable (the right to payment of money), insurance \npolicy proceeds, energy provided or to be provided, winnings in a lottery, health-care-insurance \nreceivables, promissory notes, securities, letters of credit, and interests in business entities. [15] Often there \nis something in writing to show the existence of the right—such as a right to receive the proceeds of \nsomebody else’s insurance payout—but the writing is merely evidence of the right. The paper itself doesn’t \nhave to be delivered for the transfer of the right to be effective; that’s done by assignment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1026 \nGeneral Intangibles \nGeneral intangibles refers to “any personal property, including things in action, other than accounts, \ncommercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents, goods, instruments, investment property, letter-of-\ncredit rights, letters of credit, money, and oil, gas, or other minerals before extraction.” General \nintangibles include payment intangibles and software.

[16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse \nreceipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the \nvalue. For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a \nsecurity interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse. If Deborah \ndefaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is \nentitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation. The warehouser will not let Carl have the \nchairs without the warehouse receipt—it’s indispensable paper. There are four kinds of indispensable \npaper. \n \nChattel Paper \nChattel is another word for goods. Chattel paper is a record (paper or electronic) that demonstrates both \n“a monetary obligation and a security interest either in certain goods or in a lease on certain \ngoods.” [17] The paper represents a valuable asset and can itself be used as collateral. For example, Creditor \nCar Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a \npurchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper). The chattel paper \nis not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from \nLift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to \nLift Co. The chattel paper is now collateral. Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic. \n \nDocuments \nThis category includes documents of title—bills of lading and warehouse receipts are examples. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1027 \n \nInstruments \nAn “instrument” here is “a negotiable instrument (checks, drafts, notes, certificates of deposit) or any \nother writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary obligation, is not itself a security \nagreement or lease, and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with \nany necessary indorsement or assignment.” “Instrument” does not include (i) investment property, (ii) \nletters of credit, or (iii) writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or \ncharge card or information contained on or for use with the card. [18] \n \nInvestment Property \nThis includes securities (stock, bonds), security accounts, commodity accounts, and commodity \ncontracts. [19] Securities may be certified (represented by a certificate) or uncertified (not represented by a \ncertificate).[20] \n \nOther Types of Collateral \nAmong possible other types of collateral that may be used as security is the floating lien. This is a \nsecurity interest in property that was not in the possession of the debtor when the security agreement was \nexecuted. The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and \nproceeds held by—most often—the business debtor. It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell \ntheir collateralized inventory. Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily \ndepleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers. Pretty soon, there’d be no security \nat all. The floating lien includes the following: \n• \nAfter-acquired property. This is property that the debtor acquires after the original deal was set \nup. It allows the secured party to enhance his security as the debtor (obligor) acquires more \nproperty subject to collateralization. \n• \nSale proceeds. These are proceeds from the disposition of the collateral. Carl Creditor takes a \nsecured interest in Deborah Debtor’s sailboat. She sells the boat and buys a garden tractor. The \nsecured interest attaches to the garden tractor. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1028 \n• \nFuture advances. Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause. The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a \n$700,000 inventory-picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor. The \nparties contemplate that the debtor will, from time to time, borrow more money, and",

The field warehouse can take one of two forms. An independent \ncompany can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—\nthus establishing physical control of the collateral. Or the independent company can lease the warehouse \nfacilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody. Either \nway, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service. The field warehouse then \nsegregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to \nthe lender for those goods. The lender is thus assured of a security interest in the collateral. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1036 \nPerfection by Control \n“A security interest in investment property, deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic chattel \npaper may be perfected by control of the collateral.” [41] “Control” depends on what the collateral is. If it’s a \nchecking account, for example, the bank with which the deposit account is maintained has “control”: the \nbank gets a security interest automatically because, as Official Comment 3 to UCC Section 9-104 puts it, \n“all actual and potential creditors of the debtor are always on notice that the bank with which the debtor’s \ndeposit account is maintained may assert a claim against the deposit account.” “Control” of electronic \nchattel paper of investment property, and of letter-of-credit rights is detailed in Sections 9-105, 9-106, \nand 9-107. Obtaining “control” means that the creditor has taken whatever steps are necessary, given the \nmanner in which the items are held, to place itself in a position where it can have the items sold, without \nfurther action by the owner. [42] \n \nAutomatic Perfection \nThe fifth mechanism of perfection is addressed in Section 9-309 of the UCC: there are several \ncircumstances where a security interest is perfected upon mere attachment. The most important here \nis automatic perfection of a purchase-money security interest given in consumer goods. If a seller of \nconsumer goods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection of the security interest is automatic. But \nthe seller may file a financial statement and faces a risk if he fails to file and the consumer debtor sells the \ngoods. Under Section 9-320(b), a buyer of consumer goods takes free of a security interest, even though \nperfected, if he buys without knowledge of the interest, pays value, and uses the goods for his personal, \nfamily, or household purposes—unless the secured party had first filed a financing statement covering the \ngoods. \n \nFigure 25.4 Attachment and Perfection \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1037 \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA creditor may be secured—allowed to take the debtor’s property upon debtor’s default—by agreement \nbetween the parties or by operation of law. The law governing agreements for personal property security is \nArticle 9 of the UCC. The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest. This is usually accomplished \nwhen the debtor, in return for value (a loan or credit) extended from the creditor, puts up as collateral some \nvaluable asset in which she has an interest and authenticates (signs) a security agreement (the contract) giving \nthe creditor a security interest in collateral and allowing that the creditor may take it if the debtor defaults. \nThe UCC lists various kinds of assets that can be collateralized, ranging from tangible property (goods), to \nassets only able to be manifested by paper (indispensable paper), to intangible assets (like patent rights). \nSometimes no security agreement is necessary, mostly if the creditor takes possession of the collateral. After \nattachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors \nclaim an interest in the collateral. Perfection is most often accomplished by filing a financing statement in the \nappropriate place to put the world on notice of the creditor’s interest. Perfection can also be achieved by a \npledge (possession by the secured creditor) or by “control” of certain assets (having such control over them as \nto be able to sell them if the debtor defaults). Perfection is automatic temporarily for some items (certified \nsecurities, instruments, and negotiable documents) but also upon mere attachment to purchase-money \nsecurity interests in consumer goods. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "A creditor is ill-advised to be unsecured because the creditor would not be able to seize the collateral if the debtor defaults. This is because the creditor does not have a security interest in the collateral. A security interest is a legal interest in property that allows the creditor to seize the property if the debtor defaults on the debt. If the creditor does not have a security interest in the collateral, they cannot seize it even if the debtor defaults. This means that the creditor would not be able to collect on the debt and would likely lose money. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the creditor to have a security interest in the collateral to ensure that they can seize it if the debtor defaults."

Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat. Who has priority? Whoever perfects first: \nthe rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet. Whoever can submit the financing \nstatement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not \ndepend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is claiming a security interest in the \nsame collateral. But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest \nfirst attached has priority? This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC \ncommentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation \nwithout [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, \nneither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee. \n \nTo rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors \nlose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected). If both parties are secured (have attached the \ninterest), the first to perfect wins. [1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins. [2] \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—\nactually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them. \n \nImmediate Exceptions \nWe call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate \npriority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it. They all involve purchase-money \nsecurity interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor \nhad sold the debtor. \n \n(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock). The UCC provides that \n“a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1042 \na conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase-money security interest is perfected \nwhen debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to \nthis UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an \nafter-acquired property clause.” \n \nSuppose Susan manufactures fur coats. On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would",

            "chunk": "agreement (not including thieves)? That is, Debtor gives Creditor a security interest in, say, goods, while \nretaining possession. First, buyers of various sorts might want the goods if they paid for them; they \nusually win. Second, lien creditors might want the goods (a lien creditor is one whose claim is based on \noperation of law—involuntarily against Debtor, and including a trustee in bankruptcy—as opposed to one \nwhose claim is based on agreement); lien creditors may be statutory (landlords, mechanics, bailees) or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1044 \njudicial. Third, a bankruptcy trustee representing Debtor’s creditors (independent of the trustee’s role as \na lien creditor) might want to take the goods to sell and satisfy Debtor’s obligations to the creditors. \nFourth, unsecured creditors; fifth, secured creditors; and sixth, secured and perfected creditors. We will \nexamine some of the possible permutations but are compelled to observe that this area of law has many \nfine nuances, not all of which can be taken up here. \n \nFirst we look at buyers who take priority over, or free of, unperfected security interests. Buyers who take \ndelivery of many types of collateral covered by anunperfected security interest win out over the hapless \nsecured party who failed to perfect if they give value and don’t know of the security interest or agricultural \nlien. [5] A buyer who doesn’t give value or who knows of the security interest will not win out, nor will a \nbuyer prevail if the seller’s creditor files a financing statement before or within twenty days after the \ndebtor receives delivery of the collateral. \n \nNow we look at buyers who take priority over perfected security interests. Sometimes people who buy \nthings even covered by a perfected security interest win out (the perfected secured party loses). \n \n• \nBuyers in the ordinary course of business. “A buyer in the ordinary course of business, other than \n[one buying farm products from somebody engaged in farming] takes free of a security interest \ncreated by the buyer’s seller, even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows \n[it].” [6] Here the buyer is usually purchasing inventory collateral, and it’s OK if he knows the \ninventory is covered by a security interest, but it’s not OK if he knows “that the sale violates a term \nin an agreement with the secured party.” [7] It would not be conducive to faith in commercial \ntransactions if buyers of inventory generally had to worry whether their seller’s creditors were \ngoing to repossess the things the buyers had purchased in good faith. For example (based on \nexample 1 to the same comment, UCC 9-320, Official Comment 3), Manufacturer makes \nappliances and owns manufacturing equipment covered by a perfected security agreement in \nfavor of Lender. Manufacturer sells the equipment to Dealer, whose business is buying and selling \nused equipment; Dealer, in turn, sells the stuff to Buyer, a buyer in the ordinary course. Does \nBuyer take free of the security interest? No, because Dealer didn’t create it; Manufacturer did. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1045 \n• \nBuyers of consumer goods purchased for personal, family, or household use take free of security \ninterests, even if perfected, so long as they buy without knowledge of the security interest, for \nvalue, for their own consumer uses, and before the filing of a financing statement covering the \ngoods. This—again—is the rub when a seller of consumer goods perfects by “mere attachment” \n(automatic perfection) and the buyer of the goods turns around and sells them. For example, Tom \nbuys a new refrigerator from Sears, which perfects by mere attachment. Tom has cash flow \nproblems and sells the fridge to Ned, his neighbor. Ned doesn’t know about Sears’s security \ninterest and pays a reasonable amount for it. He puts it in his kitchen for home use. Sears cannot \nrepossess the fridge from Ned. If it wanted to protect itself fully, Sears would have filed a \nfinancing statement; then Ned would be out the fridge when the repo men came. [8] The “value” \nissue is interestingly presented in the Nicolosi case (Section 25.5 \"Cases\"). \n• \nBuyers of farm products. The UCC itself does not protect buyers of farm products from security \ninterests created by “the person engaged in farming operations who is in the business of selling \nfarm products,” and the result was that sometimes the buyer had to pay twice: once to the farmer \nand again to the lender whom the farmer didn’t pay. As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors",

As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors \nPersons (including bankruptcy trustees) who become lien creditors before the security interest is \nperfected win out—the unperfected security interest is subordinate to lien creditors. Persons who become \nlien creditors after the security interest is perfected lose (subject to some nuances in situations where the \nlien arises between attachment by the creditor and the filing, and depending upon the type of security \ninterest and the type of collateral). [9] More straightforwardly, perhaps, a lien securing payment or \nperformance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1046 \nordinary course of business has priority over other security interests (unless a statute provides \notherwise). [10] This is the bailee or “material man” (one who supplies materials, as to build a house) with a \nlien situation. Garage Mechanic repairs a car in which Owner has previously given a perfected security \ninterest to Bank. Owner doesn’t pay Bank. Bank seeks to repossess the car from Mechanic. It will have to \npay the Mechanic first. And why not? If the car was not running, Bank would have to have it repaired \nanyway. \n \nBankruptcy Trustee \nTo what extent can the bankruptcy trustee take property previously encumbered by a security interest? It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does. The rationale: “this…enables banks to extend credit to their depositors without the need to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1047 \nexamine [records] to determine whether another party might have a security interest in the deposit \naccount.” [14] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nWho among competing creditors gets the collateral if the debtor defaults? The general rule on priorities is \nthat the first to secure most completely wins: if all competitors have perfected, the first to do so wins. If one \nhas perfected and the others have not, the one who perfects wins. If all have attached, the first to attach wins. \nIf none have attached, they’re all unsecured creditors. To this general rule there are a number of exceptions. \nPurchase-money security interests in goods and inventory prevail over previously perfected secured parties in \nthe same goods and inventory (subject to some requirements); fixture financers who file properly have \npriority over previously perfected mortgagees. Buyers in the ordinary course of business take free of a security \ninterest created by their seller, so long as they don’t know their purchase violates a security agreement.",

            "chunk": "beginning of this chapter (personal property security, suretyship, real property security)—and a common \none. Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the \ncompany, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts. The earliest \nsureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee. \nToday most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as \nsuretyship). \n \nA surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by the principal debtor, and, \nstrictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the \nsurety when the debt is due. The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, \nstrictly speaking) owes an obligation. Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up \ncollateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain \nthe creditor is paid or performance is made. For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his \ncorporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000. Bank says, “Okay, Mr. Debtor, we’ll loan the corporation \nmoney, but we want its computer equipment as security, and we want you personally to guarantee the \ndebt if the corporation can’t pay.” Sometimes, though, the surety and the principal debtor may have no \nagreement between each other; the surety might have struck a deal with the creditor to act as surety \nwithout the consent or knowledge of the principal debtor. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1055 \nA guarantor also is one who guarantees an obligation of another, and for practical purposes, \ntherefore, guarantor is usually synonymous with surety—the terms are used pretty much \ninterchangeably. But here’s the technical difference: a surety is usually a party to the original contract and \nsigns her (or his, or its) name to the original agreement along with the surety; the consideration for the \nprincipal’s contract is the same as the surety’s consideration—she is bound on the contract from the very \nstart, and she is also expected to know of the principal debtor’s default so that the creditor’s failure to \ninform her of it does not discharge her of any liability. On the other hand, a guarantor usually does not \nmake his agreement with the creditor at the same time the principal debtor does: it’s a separate contract \nrequiring separate consideration, and if the guarantor is not informed of the principal debtor’s default, the \nguarantor can claim discharge on the obligation to the extent any failure to inform him prejudices him. \nBut, again, as the terms are mostly synonymous, surety is used here to encompass both. \n \nFigure 25.6 Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety \n \n \nTypes of Suretyship \nWhere there is an interest, public or private, that requires protection from the possibility of a default, \nsureties are engaged. For example, a landlord might require that a commercial tenant not only put up a \nsecurity deposit but also show evidence that it has a surety on line ready to stand for three months’ rent if \nthe tenant defaults. Often, a municipal government will want its road contractor to show it has a surety \navailable in case, for some reason, the contractor cannot complete the project. Many states require general \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1056 \ncontractors to have bonds, purchased from insurance companies, as a condition of getting a contractor’s \nlicense; the insurance company is the surety—it will pay out if the contractor fails to complete work on the \nclient’s house. These are types of a performance bond. A judge will often require that a criminal \ndefendant put up a bond guaranteeing his appearance in court—that’s a type of suretyship where the bail-\nbonder is the surety—or that a plaintiff put up a bond indemnifying the defendant for the costs of delays \ncaused by the lawsuit—a judicial bond. A bank will take out a bond on its employees in case they steal \nmoney from the bank—the bank teller, in this case, is the principal debtor (a fidelity bond). However, as \nwe will see, sureties do not anticipate financial loss like insurance companies do: the surety expects, \nmostly, to be repaid if it has to perform. The principal debtor goes to an insurance company and buys the \nbond—the suretyship policy. The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond \napplied for, and the applicant’s financial history. A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 \npercent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent \nand 20 percent of the bond amount. When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s \nmortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee \nreleases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults. \n \nCreation of the Suretyship",

The general principles of contract law apply to suretyship. \nThus a person with the general capacity to contract has the power to become a surety. Consideration is \nrequired for a suretyship contract: if Debtor asks a friend to act as a surety to induce Creditor to make \nDebtor a loan, the consideration Debtor gives Creditor also acts as the consideration Friend gives. Where \nthe suretyship arises after Creditor has already extended credit, new consideration would be required \n(absent application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel [1]). You may recall from the chapters on \ncontracts that the promise by one person to pay or perform for the debts or defaults of another must be \nevidenced by a writing under the statute of frauds (subject to the “main purpose” exception). \n \nSuretyship contracts are affected to some extent by government regulation. Under a 1985 Federal Trade \nCommission Credit Practices Rule, creditors are prohibited from misrepresenting a surety’s liability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1057 \nCreditors must also give the surety a notice that explains the nature of the obligation and the potential \nliability that can arise if a person cosigns on another’s debt. [2] \n \nDuties and Rights of the Surety \nDuties of the Surety \nUpon the principal debtor’s default, the surety is contractually obligated to perform unless the principal \nherself or someone on her behalf discharges the obligation. When the surety performs, it must do so in \ngood faith. Because the principal debtor’s defenses are generally limited, and because—as will be noted—\nthe surety has the right to be reimbursed by the debtor, debtors not infrequently claim the surety acted in \nbad faith by doing things like failing to make an adequate investigation (to determine if the debtor really \ndefaulted), overpaying claims, interfering with the contact between the surety and the debtor, and making \nunreasonable refusals to let the debtor complete the project. The case Fidelity and Deposit Co. of \nMaryland v. Douglas Asphalt Co.,in Section 25.5 \"Cases\", is typical. \n \nRights of the Surety \nThe surety has four main rights stemming from its obligation to answer for the debt or default of the \nprincipal debtor. \n \n \n \nExoneration \nIf, at the time a surety’s obligation has matured, the principal can satisfy the obligation but refuses to do \nso, the surety is entitled to exoneration—a court order requiring the principal to perform. It would be \ninequitable to force the surety to perform and then to have to seek reimbursement from the principal if \nall along the principal is able to perform. \n \nReimbursement \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1058 \nIf the surety must pay the creditor because the principal has defaulted, the principal is obligated to \nreimburse the surety. The amount required to be reimbursed includes the surety’s reasonable, good-faith \noutlays, including interest and legal fees. \n \nSubrogation \nSuppose the principal’s duty to the creditor is fully satisfied and that the surety has contributed to this \nsatisfaction. Then the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor against the principal. \nIn other words, the surety stands in the creditor’s shoes and may assert against the principal whatever \nrights the creditor could have asserted had the duty not been discharged. The right \nof subrogation includes the right to take secured interests that the creditor obtained from the principal \nto cover the duty. Sarah’s Pizzeria owes Martha $5,000, and Martha has taken a security interest in \nSarah’s Chevrolet. Eva is surety for the debt. Sarah defaults, and Eva pays Martha the $5,000. Eva is \nentitled to have the security interest in the car transferred to her. \n \nContribution \nTwo or more sureties who are bound to answer for the principal’s default and who should share between \nthem the loss caused by the default are known as cosureties. A surety who in performing its own \nobligation to the creditor winds up paying more than its proportionate share is entitled to contribution \nfrom the cosureties. \n \n \n \nDefenses of the Parties \nThe principal and the surety may have defenses to paying. \n \nDefenses of the Principal",

The plaintiff heard \nthe repossession in progress and ran outside in his underwear shouting “Don’t take it” to the agents. The \nagents did not respond and proceeded to take the car. The plaintiff argued the repossession breached the \npeace and he was entitled to the statutory remedy for violation of section 9-503, denial of a deficiency \njudgment to the secured party, Chrysler.… \n \nAfter a thorough analysis of the term “breach of the peace,” the court concluded the term “connotes \nconduct which incites or is likely to incite immediate public turbulence, or which leads to or is likely to \nlead to an immediate loss of public order and tranquility. Violent conduct is not a necessary element. The \nprobability of violence at the time of or immediately prior to the repossession is \nsufficient.”…[The Koontz court] held the circumstances of the repossession did not amount to a breach \nthe peace. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1068 \n \nThe court then considered the plaintiff’s argument that Chrysler breached the peace by repossessing the \ncar under circumstances constituting criminal trespass to property. Looking to cases in other \njurisdictions, the court determined that, “in general, a mere trespass, standing alone, does not \nautomatically constitute a breach of the peace.” [Citation] (taking possession of car from private driveway \ndoes not, without more, constitute breach of the peace), [Citation] (no breach of the peace occurred where \ncar repossessed from debtor’s driveway without entering “any gates, doors, or other barricades to reach” \ncar), [Citation] (no breach of the peace occurred where car was parked partially under carport and \nundisputed that no door, “not even one to a garage,” on the debtor’s premises was opened, much less \nbroken, to repossess the car), [Citation] (although secured party may not break into or enter homes or \nbuildings or enclosed spaces to effectuate a repossession, repossession of vehicle from parking lot of \ndebtor’s apartment building was not breach of the peace), [Citation] (repossession of car from debtor’s \ndriveway without entering any gates, doors or other barricades was accomplished without breach of the \npeace).… \n \nAlthough the evidence showed the plaintiff notified Chrysler prior to the repossession that it was not \npermitted onto his property, the court held Chrysler’s entry onto the property to take the car did not \nconstitute a breach of the peace because there was no evidence Chrysler entered through a barricade or \ndid anything other than drive the car away. [Citation] “Chrysler enjoyed a limited privilege to enter [the \nplaintiff’s] property for the sole and exclusive purpose of effectuating the repossession. So long as the \nentry was limited in purpose (repossession), and so long as no gates, barricades, doors, enclosures, \nbuildings, or chains were breached or cut, no breach of the peace occurred by virtue of the entry onto his \nproperty.” \n \n…[W]e come to essentially the same conclusion: where a repossession is effectuated by an actual breaking \ninto the lessee/debtor’s premises or breaching or cutting of chains, gates, barricades, doors or other \nbarriers designed to exclude trespassers, the likelihood that a breach of the peace occurred is high. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1069 \nDavenport v. Chrysler Credit Corp., [Citation] (Tenn.App.1991), a case analyzing Tennessee’s version of \nsection 9-503 is particularly helpful, holding that “‘[a] breach of the peace is almost certain to be found if \nthe repossession is accompanied by the unauthorized entry into a closed or locked garage.’”…This is so \nbecause “public policy favors peaceful, non-trespassory repossessions when the secured party has a free \nright of entry” and “forced entries onto the debtor’s property or into the debtor’s premises are viewed as \nseriously detrimental to the ordinary conduct of human affairs.” Davenport held that the creditor’s \nrepossession of a car by entering a closed garage and cutting a chain that would have prevented it from \nremoving the car amounted to a breach of the peace, “[d]espite the absence of violence or physical \nconfrontation” (because the debtor was not at home when the repossession \noccurred).Davenport recognized that the secured creditors’ legitimate interest in obtaining possession of \ncollateral without having to resort to expensive and cumbersome judicial procedures must be balanced \nagainst the debtors’ legitimate interest in being free from unwarranted invasions of their property and \nprivacy interests. \n \n“Repossession is a harsh procedure and is, essentially, a delegation of the State’s exclusive prerogative to \nresolve disputes. Accordingly, the statutes governing the repossession of collateral should be construed in \na way that prevents abuse and discourages illegal conduct which might otherwise go unchallenged \nbecause of the debtor’s lack of knowledge of legally proper repossession techniques” [Citation].",

One, enacted in 1974, is the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), aimed at abuses in the settlement process—the process of \nobtaining the mortgage and purchasing a residence. The act covers all federally related first mortgage \nloans secured by residential properties for one to four families. It requires the lender to disclose \ninformation about settlement costs in advance of the closing day: it prohibits the lender from “springing” \nunexpected or hidden costs onto the borrower. The RESPA is a US Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) consumer protection statute designed to help home buyers be better shoppers in the \nhome-buying process, and it is enforced by HUD. It also outlaws what had been a common practice of \ngiving and accepting kickbacks and referral fees. The act prohibits lenders from requiring mortgagors to \nuse a particular company to obtain insurance, and it limits add-on fees the lender can demand to cover \nfuture insurance and tax charges. \n \nRedlining. Several statutes are directed to the practice of redlining—the refusal of lenders to make loans \non property in low-income neighborhoods or impose stricter mortgage terms when they do make loans \nthere. (The term derives from the supposition that lenders draw red lines on maps around ostensibly \nmarginal neighborhoods.) The most important of these is the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of \n1977. [1] The act requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated \nfinancial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, \nconsistent with safe and sound operation. To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine \nbanking institutions for CRA compliance and take this information into consideration when approving \napplications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions. The information is compiled under the \nauthority of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires financial institutions within its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1084 \npurview to report annually by transmitting information from their loan application registers to a federal \nagency. \n \nThe Note and the Mortgage Documents \nThe note and the mortgage documents are the contracts that set up the deal: the mortgagor gets credit, \nand the mortgagee gets the right to repossess the property in case of default. \n \nThe Note \nIf the lender decides to grant a mortgage, the mortgagor signs two critical documents at the closing: the \nnote and the mortgage. We cover notes in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\". It is \nenough here to recall that in a note (really a type of IOU), the mortgagor promises to pay a specified \nprincipal sum, plus interest, by a certain date or dates. The note is the underlying obligation for which the \nmortgage serves as security. Without the note, the mortgagee would have an empty document, since the \nmortgage would secure nothing. Without a mortgage, a note is still quite valid, evidencing the debtor’s \npersonal obligation. \n \nOne particular provision that usually appears in both mortgages and the underlying notes is \nthe acceleration clause. This provides that if a debtor should default on any particular payment, the \nentire principal and interest will become due immediately at the lender’s option. Why an acceleration \nclause? Without it, the lender would be powerless to foreclose the entire mortgage when the mortgagor \ndefaulted but would have to wait until the expiration of the note’s term. Although the acceleration clause \nis routine, it will not be enforced unless the mortgagee acts in an equitable and fair manner. The problem \narises where the mortgagor’s default was the result of some unconscionable conduct of the mortgagee, \nsuch as representing to the mortgagee that she might take a sixty-day “holiday” from having to make \npayments. In Paul H. Cherry v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Group (Section 26.4 \"Cases\"), the equitable \npowers of the court were invoked to prevent acceleration. \n \nThe Mortgage \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1085 \nUnder the statute of frauds, the mortgage itself must be evidenced by some writing to be enforceable.

The CRA was enacted by the United States Congress in 1977, and was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 12, 1977. The law is enforced by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The law is administered by the Federal Reserve Board through Regulation BB, which implements the CRA. The CRA is a major part of the U.S. federal banking laws. It requires the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to assess the record of each bank and thrift institution in helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA also requires that the record of each insured depository institution be considered by the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency when the institution is applying for or seeking to merge with another bank or thrift institution.

                    "question": "What is the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act?",
                    "answer": "The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) is a United States federal law enacted in 1974, intended to help ensure consumers are treated fairly in real estate settlement transactions. RESPA also requires lenders to provide consumers with good-faith estimates of settlement costs. The law applies to all federally related mortgage loans, including purchase, refinance, and home equity loans. RESPA is enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is responsible for implementing the law and investigating potential violations. RESPA requires lenders to provide consumers with good-faith estimates of settlement costs. These costs include things like loan origination fees, appraisal fees, and title insurance. RESPA also prohibits lenders from requiring borrowers to use specific title insurance companies or other settlement service providers. RESPA also prohibits kickbacks and referral fees. Kickbacks are payments made to settlement service providers in exchange for referrals. Referral fees are payments made to real estate brokers or other professionals in exchange for referring clients to settlement service providers.

Understand the nonconsensual liens issued by courts—attachment liens and judgment liens—and how they \nare created. \n2. Recognize other types of nonconsensual liens: mechanic’s lien, possessory lien, and tax lien. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1095 \nThe security arrangements discussed so far—security interests, suretyship, mortgages—are all \nobtained by the creditor with the debtor’s consent. A creditor may obtain certain liens without the \ndebtor’s consent. \n \nCourt-Decreed Liens \nSome nonconsensual liens are issued by courts. \n \nAttachment Lien \nAn attachment lien is ordered against a person’s property—real or personal—to prevent him from \ndisposing of it during a lawsuit. To obtain an attachment lien, the plaintiff must show that the defendant \nlikely will dispose of or hide his property; if the court agrees with the plaintiff, she must post a bond and \nthe court will issue a writ of attachment to the sheriff, directing the sheriff to seize the property. \nAttachments of real property should be recorded. Should the plaintiff win her suit, the court issues a writ \nof execution, directing the sheriff to sell the property to satisfy the judgment. \n \nJudgment Lien \nA judgment lien may be issued when a plaintiff wins a judgment in court if an attachment lien has not \nalready been issued. Like the attachment lien, it provides a method by which the defendant’s property \nmay be seized and sold. \n \nMechanic’s Lien \nOverview \nThe most common nonconsensual lien on real estate is the mechanic’s lien. A mechanic’s lien can be \nobtained by one who furnishes labor, services, or materials to improve real estate: this is statutory, and \nthe statute must be carefully followed. The “mechanic” here is one who works with his or her hands, not \nspecifically one who works on machines. An automobile mechanic could not obtain a mechanic’s lien on a \ncustomer’s house to secure payment of work he did on her car. (The lien to which the automobile \nmechanic is entitled is a “possessory lien” or “artisan’s lien,” considered in Section 26.3.3 \"Possessory \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1096 \nLien\") To qualify for a mechanic’s lien, the claimant must file a sworn statement describing the work \ndone, the contract made, or the materials furnished that permanently improved the real estate. \n \nA particularly difficult problem crops up when the owner has paid the contractor, who in turn fails to pay \nhis subcontractors. In many states, the subcontractors can file a lien on the owner’s property, thus forcing \nthe owner to pay them (see Figure 26.5 \"Subcontractors’ Lien\")—and maybe twice. To protect themselves, \nowners can demand a sworn statement from general contractors listing the subcontractors used on the \njob, and from them, owners can obtain a waiver of lien rights before paying the general contractor. \n \nFigure 26.5 Subcontractors’ Lien \n \n \nProcedure for Obtaining a Mechanic’s Lien \nAnyone claiming a lien against real estate must record a lien statement stating the amount due and the \nnature of the improvement. The lienor has a specified period of time (e.g., ninety days) to file from the \ntime the work is finished. Recording as such does not give the lienor an automatic right to the property if \nthe debt remains unpaid. All states specify a limited period of time, usually one year, within which the \nclaimant must file suit to enforce the lien. Only if the court decides the lien is valid may the property be \nsold to satisfy the debt. Difficult questions sometimes arise when a lien is filed against a landlord’s \nproperty as a result of improvements and services provided to a tenant, as discussed in F & D Elec. \nContractors, Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc.,Section 26.4 \"Cases\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1097 \n \nMechanic’s Liens Priorities \nA mechanic’s lien represents a special risk to the purchaser of real estate or to lenders who wish to take a \nmortgage. In most states, the mechanic’s lien is given priority not from the date when the lien is recorded \nbut from an earlier date—either the date the contractor was hired or the date construction began. Thus a \npurchaser or lender might lose priority to a creditor with a mechanic’s lien who filed after the sale or \nmortgage. A practical solution to this problem is to hold back part of the funds (purchase price or loan) or \nplace them in escrow until the period for recording liens has expired. \n \nPossessory Lien \nThe most common nonconsensual lien on personal property (not real estate) is the possessory lien. \nThis is the right to continue to keep the goods on which work has been performed or for which materials",

A practical solution to this problem is to hold back part of the funds (purchase price or loan) or \nplace them in escrow until the period for recording liens has expired. \n \nPossessory Lien \nThe most common nonconsensual lien on personal property (not real estate) is the possessory lien. \nThis is the right to continue to keep the goods on which work has been performed or for which materials \nhave been supplied until the owner pays for the labor or materials. The possessory lien arises both under \ncommon law and under a variety of statutes. Because it is nonconsensual, the possessory lien is not \ncovered by Article 9 of the UCC, which is restricted to consensual security interests. Nor is it governed by \nthe law of mechanic’s liens, which are nonpossessory and relate only to work done to improve real \nproperty. \n \nThe common-law rule is that anyone who, under an express or implied contract, adds value to another’s \nchattel (personal property) by labor, skill, or materials has a possessory lien for the value of the services. \nMoreover, the lienholder may keep the chattel until her services are paid. For example, the dry cleaner \nshop is not going to release the wool jacket that you took in for cleaning unless you make satisfactory \narrangements to pay for it, and the chain saw store won’t let you take the chain saw that you brought in \nfor a tune-up until you pay for the labor and materials for the tune-up. \n \nTax Lien \nAn important statutory lien is the federal tax lien. Once the government assesses a tax, the amount due \nconstitutes a lien on the owner’s property, whether real or personal. Until it is filed in the appropriate \nstate office, others take priority, including purchasers, mechanics’ lienors, judgment lien creditors, and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1098 \nholders of security interests. But once filed, the tax lien takes priority over all subsequently arising liens. \nFederal law exempts some property from the tax lien; for example, unemployment benefits, books and \ntools of a trade, workers’ compensation, judgments for support of minor children, minimum amounts of \nwages and salary, personal effects, furniture, fuel, and provisions are exempt. \n \nLocal governments also can assess liens against real estate for failure to pay real estate taxes. After some \nperiod of time, the real estate may be sold to satisfy the tax amounts owing. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are four types of nonconsensual liens: (1) court-decreed liens are attachment liens, which prevent a \nperson from disposing of assets pending a lawsuit, and judgment liens, which allow the prevailing party in a \nlawsuit to take property belonging to the debtor to satisfy the judgment; (2) mechanics’ liens are authorized \nby statute, giving a person who has provided labor or material to a landowner the right to sell the property to \nget paid; (3) possessory liens on personal property allow one in possession of goods to keep them to satisfy a \nclaim for work done or storage of them; and (4) tax liens are enforced by the government to satisfy \noutstanding tax liabilities and may be assessed against real or personal property. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. The mortgagor’s interests are protected in a judicial foreclosure by a court’s oversight of the process; how \nis the mortgagor’s interest protected when a deed of trust is used? \n2. Why is the deed of trust becoming increasingly popular? \n3. What is the rationale for the common-law possessory lien? \n4.

Prior to signing the lease, Powder Coaters negotiated the terms with Mark \nTaylor, (“Taylor”) who was the property manager for the warehouse facility and an agent of BG Holding. \n \nThe warehouse facility did not have a sufficient power supply to support Powder Coaters’ machinery. \nTherefore, Powder Coaters contracted with F & D Electrical (“F & D”) to perform electrical work which \nincluded installing two eight foot strip light fixtures and a two hundred amp load center. Powder Coaters \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1105 \nnever paid F & D for the services.

The Court of Appeals, in a two to one decision, reversed the trial court, holding a \ndirected verdict should have been granted to BG Holding on the grounds BG Holding did not consent to \nthe electrical upgrade, as is required by the Mechanic’s Lien Statute. This Court granted F & D’s petition \nfor certiorari, and the issue before this Court is: \nDid the trial court err in denying BG Holding’s motion for directed verdict because the record \nwas devoid of any evidence of owner’s consent to materialman’s performance of work on its \nproperty as required by [the S.C. statute]? \n \nLaw/Analysis \nF & D argues the majority of the Court of Appeals erred in holding the facts of the case failed to establish \nthat BG Holding consented to the work performed by F & D, as is required by the [South Carolina] \nMechanic’s Lien Statute.

What Kind of Consent Is Necessary. \nThis Court has already clearly held the consent required by [the relevant section] is “something more than \na mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence. It implies an agreement to that which, but for \nthe consent, could not exist, and which the party consenting has a right to forbid.” [Citations.] However, \nour Mechanics Lien Statute has never been applied in the landlord-tenant context where a third party is \ninvolved. \n \nOther jurisdictions have addressed this issue. The Court of Appeals cited [a Connecticut case, 1987] in \nsupport of its holding. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Connecticut court’s reasoning is \npersuasive, especially since Connecticut has a similar mechanics lien statute.… \n \nThe Connecticut courts have stated “the consent required from the owner or one acting under the owner’s \nauthority is more than the mere granting of permission for work to be conducted on one’s property; or the \nmere knowledge that work was being performed on one’s land.” Furthermore, although the Connecticut \ncourts have stated the statute does not require an express contract, the courts have required “consent that \nindicates an agreement that the owner of…the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor.”… \n \nThe reasoning of [Connecticut and other states that have decided this issue] is persuasive. F & D’s brief \nappears to argue that mere knowledge by the landowner that the work needed to be done, coupled with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1108 \nthe landlord’s general “permission” to perform the work, is enough to establish consent under the statute. \nUnder this interpretation, a landlord who knew a tenant needed to improve, upgrade, or add to the leased \npremises would be liable to any contractor and/or subcontractor who performed work on his land. Under \nF & D’s interpretation the landlord would not be required to know the scope, cost, etc. of the work, but \nwould only need to give the tenant general permission to perform upgrades or improvements. \n \nClearly, if the landlord/owner or his agent gives consent directly to the materialman, a lien can be \nestablished. Consent can also be given to the tenant, but the consent needs to be specific. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent must know the scope of the project (for instance, as the lease provided in the \ninstant case, the landlord could approve written plans submitted by the tenant). The consent needs to be \nmore than “mere knowledge” that the tenant will perform work on the property. There must be some kind \nof express or implied agreement that the landlord may be held liable for the work or material. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent may delegate the project or work to his tenant, but there must be an express \nor implied agreement about the specific work to be done. A general provision in a lease which allows \ntenant to make repairs or improvements is not enough. \n \nC. Evidence There Was No Consent \n• \nThe record is clear that no contract, express or implied, existed between BG Holding and F & G. \nBG Holding had no knowledge F & G would be performing the work. \n• \nF & G’s supervisor, David Weatherington, and Ray Dutton, the owner of F & D, both testified they \nnever had a conversation with anyone from BG Holding.

But involuntary bankruptcy is possible, too, \nunder Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. To put anyone into bankruptcy involuntarily, the petitioning creditors \nmust meet three conditions: (1) they must have claims for unsecured debt amounting to at least $13,475; \n(2) three creditors must join in the petition whenever twelve or more creditors have claims against the \nparticular debtor—otherwise, one creditor may file an involuntary petition, as long as his claim is for at \nleast $13,475; (3) there must be no bona fide dispute about the debt owing. If there is a dispute, the debtor \ncan resist the involuntary filing, and if she wins the dispute, the creditors who pushed for the involuntary \npetition have to pay the associated costs. Persons owing less than $13,475, farmers, and charitable \norganizations cannot be forced into bankruptcy. \n \nThe Automatic Stay \nThe petition—voluntary or otherwise—operates as a stay against suits or other actions against the debtor \nto recover claims, enforce judgments, or create liens (but not alimony collection). In other words, once the \npetition is filed, the debtor is freed from worry over other proceedings affecting her finances or property. \nNo more debt collection calls! Anyone with a claim, secured or unsecured, must seek relief in the \nbankruptcy court. This provision in the act can have dramatic consequences. Beset by tens of thousands of \nproducts-liability suits for damages caused by asbestos, UNR Industries and Manville Corporation, the \nnation’s largest asbestos producers, filed (separate) voluntary bankruptcy petitions in 1982; those filings \nautomatically stayed all pending lawsuits. \n \nFirst Meeting of Creditors \nOnce a petition in bankruptcy is filed, the court issues an order of relief, which determines that the \ndebtor’s property is subject to bankruptcy court control and creates the stay. The Chapter 7 case may be \ndismissed by the court if, after a notice and hearing, it finds that among other things (e.g., delay, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1130 \nnonpayment of required bankruptcy fees), the debts are primarily consumer debts and the debtor could \npay them off—that’s the 2005 act’s famous “means test,” discussed in Section 27.3 \"Chapter 7 \nLiquidation\". \n \nAssuming that the order of relief has been properly issued, the creditors must meet within a reasonable \ntime. The debtor is obligated to appear at the meeting and submit to examination under oath. The judge \ndoes not preside and, indeed, is not even entitled to attend the meeting. \n \nWhen the judge issues an order for relief, an interim trustee is appointed who is authorized initially to \ntake control of the debtor’s assets. The trustee is required to collect the property, liquidate the debtor’s \nestate, and distribute the proceeds to the creditors. The trustee may sue and be sued in the name of the \nestate. Under every chapter except Chapter 7, the court has sole discretion to name the trustee. Under \nChapter 7, the creditors may select their own trustee as long as they do it at the first meeting of creditors \nand follow the procedures laid down in the act. \nTrustee’s Powers and Duties \nThe act empowers the trustee to use, sell, or lease the debtor’s property in the ordinary course of business \nor, after notice and a hearing, even if not in the ordinary course of business. In all cases, the trustee must \nprotect any security interests in the property. As long as the court has authorized the debtor’s business to \ncontinue, the trustee may also obtain credit in the ordinary course of business. She may invest money in \nthe estate to yield the maximum, but reasonably safe, return. Subject to the court’s approval, she may \nemploy various professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and appraisers, and may, with some \nexceptions, assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases that the debtor has made. The \ntrustee also has the power to avoid many prebankruptcy transactions in order to recover property of the \ndebtor to be included in the liquidation. \n \nCreditors’ Claims, the Debtor, and the Estate (Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nWe now turn to the major matters covered in Chapter 5 of the bankruptcy act: creditors’ claims, debtors’ \nexemptions and discharge, and the property to be included in the estate. We begin with the rules \ngoverning proof of claims by creditors and the priority of their claims. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1131 \n \nClaims and Creditors \nA claim is defined as a right to payment, whether or not it is reduced to judgment, liquidated, \nunliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or",

Chapter 7 cases may always be converted to \nChapter 13. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nChapter 13 is voluntary only. Anyone—sole proprietorships included—who has a regular income, \nunsecured debts of less than $336,000, and secured debts of less than $1,010,650 is eligible to seek its \nprotection. The debts must be unpaid and owing at the time the debtor applies for relief. If the person has \nmore debt than that, she will have to file Chapter 11. The debtor must attend a credit-counseling class, as \nin Chapter 7. \n \nThe Plan \nPlans are typically extensions or compositions—that is, they extend the time to pay what is owing, or they \nare agreements among creditors each to accept something less than the full amount owed (so that all get \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1153 \nsomething). Under Chapter 13, the stretch-out period is three to five three years. The plan must provide \nfor payments of all future income or a sufficient portion of it to the trustee. Priority creditors are entitled \nto be paid in full, although they may be paid later than required under the original indebtedness. As long \nas the plan is being carried out, the debtor may enjoin any creditors from suing to collect the original debt. \n \nConfirmation \nUnder Section 1325 of the bankruptcy code, the court must approve the plan if it meets certain \nrequirements. These include (1) distribution of property to unsecured creditors whose claims are allowed \nin an amount no less than that which they would have received had the estate been liquidated under \nChapter 7; (2) acceptance by secured creditors, with some exceptions, such as when the debtor surrenders \nthe secured property to the creditor; and (3) proposal of the plan “in good faith.” If the trustee or an \nunsecured creditor objects to confirmation, the plan must meet additional tests. For example, a plan will \nbe approved if all of the debtor’s disposable income (as defined in Section 1325) over the commitment \nperiod (three to five years) will be used to make payments under the plan. \n \nDischarge \nOnce a debtor has made all payments called for in the plan, the court will discharge him from all \nremaining debts except certain long-term debts and obligations to pay alimony, maintenance, and \nsupport. Under former law, Chapter 13 was so broad that it permitted the court to discharge the debtor \nfrom many debts considered nondischargeable under Chapter 7, but 1994 amendments and the 2005 act \nmade Chapter 13 less expansive. Debts dischargeable in Chapter 13, but not in Chapter 7, include debts for \nwillful and malicious injury to property, debts incurred to pay nondischargeable tax obligations, and debts \narising from property settlements in divorce or separation proceedings. (See Section 27.6 \"Cases\", In re \nRyan, for a discussion of what debts are dischargeable under Chapter 13 as compared with Chapter 7.) \n \nAlthough a Chapter 13 debtor generally receives a discharge only after completing all payments required \nby the court-approved (i.e., “confirmed”) repayment plan, there are some limited circumstances under \nwhich the debtor may request the court to grant a “hardship discharge” even though the debtor has failed \nto complete plan payments. Such a discharge is available only to a debtor whose failure to complete plan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1154 \npayments is due to circumstances beyond the debtor’s control. A Chapter 13 discharge stays on the credit \nrecord for up to ten years. \n \nA discharge may be denied if the debtor previously went through a bankruptcy too soon before filing \nChapter 13, failed to act in good faith, or—with some exceptions—failed to complete a personal financial \nmanagement course. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nChapter 11—frequently referred to as “corporate reorganization”—is most often used by businesses whose \nvalue as a going concern is greater than it would be if liquidated, but, with some exceptions, anyone eligible to \nfile Chapter 7 can file Chapter 11. The business owners, or in some cases the trustee or creditors, develop a \nplan to pay the firm’s debts over a three- to five-year period; the plan must be approved by creditors and the \ncourt. Chapter 13—frequently called the wage-earner’s plan—is a similar mechanism by which a person can \ndischarge some debt and have longer to pay debts off than originally scheduled. Under Chapter 13, people can \nget certain relief from creditors that they cannot get in Chapter 7. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

It was almost three years after the entry of her chapter 7 discharge \n‘on January 3, 2006 that the debtor reopened her chapter 7 case in order to pursue this adversary \nproceeding.’ \n \nIn her complaint, the debtor admits that after she received a discharge, she found part-time work with a \nchurch and later took a full-time job as a speech therapist. During 2006, the debtor earned $20,009 and \nin 2007 she earned $37,314.

[Coleman was a \nChapter 13 case.] \n \nHere, the debtor was injured in an automobile accident on January 17, 2007, almost exactly one year after \nher January 3, 2006 chapter 7 discharge. Because the accident had no causal link to the misfortune \nprompting the debtor to seek bankruptcy relief in the first instance, the accident cannot be relied on to \njustify the discharge of the student loans because repayment would be an undue hardship. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1162 \nTo hold otherwise would mean that a bankruptcy discharge is a perpetual license to discharge student \nloans based on events that occur years after the bankruptcy discharge is granted. If a discharged debtor \nsuffers later financial misfortune, that debtor must consider seeking another discharge subject to the \nlimitations imposed by [the sections of the code stipulating how often a person can petition for \nbankruptcy]. In the context of a second case, the debtor could then ask that the student loan be declared \ndischargeable under section 523(a)(8). \n \nIn this instance, the debtor is now eligible for a discharge in a chapter 13 case. Her chapter 7 petition was \nfiled on September 19, 2005. Section 1328(f)(1) bars a chapter 13 discharge when the debtor has received \na chapter 7 discharge in a case commenced in the prior four years. She would not be eligible for a chapter \n7 discharge until September 19, 2013. \n \nThis is not to say that post-discharge events are irrelevant. The second and third prongs of the Pena test \nrequire the court to consider whether the circumstances preventing a debtor from repaying a student loan \nare likely to persist, and whether the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the student loan. Post-\ndischarge events are relevant to these determinations because they require the court to look into the \ndebtor’s financial future. \n \nUnfortunately for the debtor, it is unnecessary to consider the second and third prongs because she \ncannot satisfy the first prong. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. What is the rationale for making the bankruptcy discharge of student loans very difficult? \n2. Petitioner argued that she should be able to use a postdischarge event (the auto accident) as a basis for \nestablishing that she could not maintain a “minimal” standard of living, and thus she should get a \nretroactive discharge of her student loans.

The court cites the Coleman case. That was a Chapter 13 proceeding. Here were the facts: Debtor had \nnot yet completed her payments under her five-year repayment plan, and no discharge order had yet \nbeen entered; one year into the plan, she was laid off work. She had been trying to repay her student \nloans for several years, and she claimed she would suffer hardship in committing to the five-year \nrepayment plan without any guarantee that her student loan obligations would be discharged, since \nshe was required to commit all of her disposable income to payments under the plan and would likely \nbe forced to pursue undue hardship issue pro se upon completion of the plan.” In Coleman, the court \nheld that Debtor could, postfiling but predischarge—one year into the five-year plan—bring up the \nhardship issue. \nNow, in the case here, after the auto accident, the petitioner “subsists” on Social Security disability \npayments, and she has almost $150,000 in debt, yet the court prohibited her from claiming a hardship \ndischarge of student loans. Does this result really make sense? Is the court’s concern that allowing this \npostdischarge relief would mean “that a bankruptcy discharge is a perpetual license to discharge \nstudent loans based on events that occur years after the bankruptcy discharge is granted” well \nfounded? Suppose it is scheduled to take thirty years to pay off student loans; in year 4, the student-\nborrower, now Debtor, declares Chapter 7 bankruptcy, student loans not being discharged; in year 6, \nthe person is rendered disabled.

The district court, following an appellate mandate, ultimately \neliminated the restitution obligation. \n \nOn April 25, 2003, Ryan filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under chapter 7 in the District of Idaho. He \nreceived his chapter 7 discharge on August 11, 2003. Shortly thereafter, Ryan filed a case under chapter \n13, listing as his only obligation the amount of unpaid costs of prosecution owed to the United States \n(“Government”).… \n \nRyan completed payments under the plan, and an “Order of Discharge” was entered on October 5, 2006. \nThe chapter 13 trustee’s final report reflected that the Government received $2,774.89 from payments \nmade by Ryan under his plan, but a balance of $77,088.34 on the Government’s costs of prosecution \nclaim remained unpaid. Ryan then renewed his request for determination of dischargeability. The \nbankruptcy court held that the unpaid portion of the Government’s claim for costs of prosecution was \nexcepted from discharge by § 1328(a)(3). Ryan appealed. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1168 \n \nSection 1328(a)(3) provides an exception to discharge in chapter 13 for “restitution, or a criminal fine.” It \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \n[A]s soon as practicable after the completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, the \ncourt shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under \nsection 502 of this title except any debt… \n \n(3) for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime \n[.] [emphasis added]. \n \nThe essential question, then, is whether these costs of prosecution constitute a “criminal fine.” \n \nStatutory interpretation begins with a review of the particular language used by Congress in the relevant \nversion of the law. [Citation.] \n \nThe term “criminal fine” is not defined in [Chapter 13] or anywhere else in the Bankruptcy Code. \nHowever, its use in § 1328(a)(3) implicates two important policies embedded in the Bankruptcy Code. \nFirst, in light of the objective to provide a fresh start for debtors overburdened by debts that they cannot \npay, exceptions to discharge are interpreted strictly against objecting creditors and in favor of \ndebtors. See, e.g. [Citations]. In chapter 13, this principle is particularly important because Congress \nadopted the liberal “superdischarge” provisions of § 1328 as an incentive to debtors to commit to a plan to \npay their creditors all of their disposable income over a period of years rather than simply discharging \ntheir debts in a chapter 7 liquidation. \n \n“[T]he dischargeability of debts in chapter 13 that are not dischargeable in chapter 7 represents a policy \njudgment that [it] is preferable for debtors to attempt to pay such debts to the best of their abilities over \nthree years rather than for those debtors to have those debts hanging over their heads indefinitely, \nperhaps for the rest of their lives.” [Citations.] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1169 \n \nA second, countervailing policy consideration is a historic deference, both in the Bankruptcy Code and in \nthe administration of prior bankruptcy law, to excepting criminal sanctions from discharge in bankruptcy. \nApplication of this policy is consistent with a general recognition that, “[t]he principal purpose of the \nBankruptcy Code is to grant a ‘fresh start’ to the ‘honest but unfortunate debtor.’” [Citation] (emphasis \nadded [in original]). \n \nThe legislative history is clear that [in its 1994 amendments to the bankruptcy law] Congress intended to \noverrule the result in [of a 1990 Supreme Court case so that]:…“[N]o debtor with criminal restitution \nobligations will be able to discharge them through any bankruptcy proceeding.”… \n \nThe imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor is different from ordering a defendant \nto pay criminal fines. Costs are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines are generally paid to a \nspecial fund for victims’ compensation and assistance in the U.S. Treasury.… \n \nTo honor the principle that exceptions to discharge are to be construed narrowly in favor of debtors, \nparticularly in chapter 13, where a broad discharge was provided by Congress as an incentive for debtors \nto opt for relief under that chapter rather than under chapter 7, it is not appropriate to expand the scope \nof the [Chapter 13] exception beyond the terms of the statute. Congress could have adopted an exception",

What is the rationale for making some things dischargeable under Chapter 13 that are not dischargeable \nunder Chapter 7? \n2. What is the difference between “criminal restitution” (which in 1994 Congress said could not get \ndischarged at all) and “the costs of prosecution”? \n3. Why did the court decide that Ryan’s obligation to pay “costs of prosecution” was not precluded by the \nlimits on Chapter 13 bankruptcies imposed by Congress? \n \n \n \n27.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to legislate on bankruptcy. The current law is the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which provides for six types of proceedings: (1) \nliquidation, Chapter 7; (2) adjustment of debts of a municipality, Chapter 9; (3) reorganization, Chapter \n11; (4) family farmers with regular income, Chapter 12; (5) individuals with regular income, Chapter 13; \nand (6) cross-border bankruptcies, Chapter 15. \n \nWith some exceptions, any individual, partnership, or corporation seeking liquidation may file a voluntary \npetition in bankruptcy. An involuntary petition is also possible; creditors petitioning for that must meet \ncertain criteria. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1171 \nA petition operates as a stay against the debtor for lawsuits to recover claims or enforce judgments or \nliens. A judge will issue an order of relief and appoint a trustee, who takes over the debtor’s property and \npreserves security interests. To recover monies owed, creditors must file proof of claims. The trustee has \ncertain powers to recover property for the estate that the debtor transferred before bankruptcy. These \ninclude the power to act as a hypothetical lien creditor, to avoid fraudulent transfers and voidable \npreferences. \n \nThe bankruptcy act sets out categories of claimants and establishes priority among them. After secured \nparties take their security, the priorities are (1) domestic support obligations, (2) administrative expenses, \n(3) gap creditor claims, (4) employees’ wages, salaries, commissions, (5) contributions to employee \nbenefit plans, (6) grain or fish producers’ claims against a storage facility, (7) consumer deposits, (8) taxes \nowed to governments, (9) allowed claims for personal injury or death resulting from debtor’s driving or \noperating a vessel while intoxicated. After these priority claims are paid, the trustee must distribute the \nestate in this order: (a) unsecured creditors who filed timely, (b) unsecured creditors who filed late, (c) \npersons claiming fines and the like, (d) all other creditors, (e) the debtor. Most bankruptcies are no-asset, \nso creditors get nothing. \n \nUnder Chapter 7’s 2005 amendments, debtors must pass a means test to be eligible for relief; if they make \ntoo much money, they must file Chapter 13. \n \nCertain property is exempt from the estate of an individual debtor. States may opt out of the federal list of \nexemptions and substitute their own; most have. \n \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable for most debts. However, some debts are not",

Briefly describe the procedure he \nshould follow to file for bankruptcy at the state level. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1173 \n2 \nAssume that David in Exercise 1 is irregularly employed and has developed a plan for paying off his \ncreditors. What type of bankruptcy should he use, Chapter 7, 11, or 13? Why? \n3 \nAssume that David owns the following unsecured property: a $3,000 oboe, a $1,000 piano, a $2,000 car, \nand a life insurance policy with a cash surrender value of $8,000. How much of this property is available \nfor distribution to his creditors in a bankruptcy? Explain. \n4 \nIf David owes his ex-wife alimony (maintenance) payments and is obligated to pay $12,000 for an \neducational loan, what effect will his discharge have on these obligations? \n5 \nAssume that David owns a corporation that he wants to liquidate under Chapter 7.

What obstacle does David \nface in obtaining a discharge for the corporation? \n6 \nThe famous retired professional football player—with a pension from the NFL—Orenthal James “O.J.” \nSimpson was convicted of wrongful death in a celebrated Santa Monica, California, trial in 1997 and \nordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to the families of the deceased. Mr. Simpson sold his California \nhouse, moved to Florida, and, from occasional appearances in the press, seemed to be living a high-style \nlife with a big house, nice cars, and sharp clothing.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget.

However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth.

Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.",

Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing\nregulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most\nimportant aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n•\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic\nconditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n•\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are\nimportant aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,\nhow it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help\nto evaluate a firm.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nElements of a Financial Plan",

Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.\nMotivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton\nShould you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a\nnew product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular",

They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they\nwork with accountants to create accurate financial reports.\nAs a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma\nfinancial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes.\nFinancial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative\nand qualitative. Figure 1.6 lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis. Some firms\nrequire an MBA or several years of business experience for their financial analysts.\n1.4 • Careers in Finance\n19\nFigure 1.6 Financial Analyst Tasks\nInternal financial analysts are important for a successful firm or organization because their work can lead to\nmore efficient and cost-effective use of financial and nonfinancial resources. Responsibilities include keeping\ncurrent with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and\noutcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports. Various government agencies also use financial analysts to aid in regulatory oversight and\nenforcement.\nA report from a 2019 BLS survey determines that financial analysts earn an average salary of $81,590, and jobs\nare predicted to grow at a faster-than-average rate of 5% through 2029.5\nBusiness (or Management) Analyst Roles\nThe job description for a business analyst looks much like that for a financial analyst.

They aid in identifying\nchallenges and solutions. Data-driven solutions help get products to market more quickly, evaluate\nperformance, and optimize production and product mix. The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies the following\nas typical business analyst duties:\n•\nGathering information about problems to be solved or procedures to be improved\n•\nInterviewing personnel and conducting onsite observations to determine the methods, equipment, and\n5\nIbid.\n20\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npersonnel that will be needed\n•\nAnalyzing financial data, revenues and expenditures, and employment reports, among other data\n•\nFinding root causes for problems and proposing solutions that may include new systems, procedures, or\npersonnel changes\n•\nPresenting findings to decision makers\n•\nConferring with managers to ensure changes work\nThe average salary for management analysts was $85,260 in May 2019, and the BLS projects 11% growth, or\nabout 94,000 new jobs, over the next decade.6\n1.5\nMarkets and Participants\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify primary and secondary markets.\n•\nIdentify key market players.\nPrimary and Secondary Markets\nSimply put, the primary market is the market for “new” securities, and the secondary market is the market\nfor “used” securities. Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell.

When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities.

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\n7\nUnited States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\n23\nHowever, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual\nfirm and industry forecasts. Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse.

Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement.

Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”\nMarket values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon\nSigns planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when\ncreating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have\nmultiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client.

Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for\nmeeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or\nhave a claim against firm assets.\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\nMuch of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\nfor their stakeholders.\n1.4 Careers in Finance\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\nto manufacturing, to education.\n1.5 Markets and Participants\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an\nindividual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.\nEconomics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial\nforecasting.\n1.7 Financial Instruments\nMaturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments. Using this methodology, we have money",

As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S",

                    "answer": "A sole proprietorship is a business structure in which the owner is responsible for all aspects of the business. The advantages of a sole proprietorship include: \n\n1. Simple and easy to set up - Sole proprietorships are relatively simple and easy to set up, making them an attractive option for small businesses.\n2. Flexibility - Sole proprietorships offer a high degree of flexibility in terms of decision-making and management.\n3. Tax advantages - Sole proprietorships are generally taxed as individuals, which can result in lower tax liabilities.\n4. Limited liability - The owner of a sole proprietorship is not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, which can provide some protection from personal financial losses.\n5. Control - Sole proprietorships offer the owner complete control over the business, allowing them to make decisions without the need for approval from others.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that sole proprietorships also have some disadvantages, including limited access to capital and limited liability protection. Additionally, sole proprietorships can be more difficult to sell or transfer ownership, as the business is tied to the owner."

S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\nRole of Management\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company.

Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\nprofits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.",

Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.\nOften, Congress enacts laws and regulations in response to major economic or other highly visible events.\nFollowing the great market crash of 1929, the US government created a new set of rules and regulations\ngoverning the issuing and trading of securities, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934. The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\nand regulations.\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors. It also set a requirement that the SEC issue new rulings that establish compliance with the act.\nBoard of Directors Oversight and Corporate Governance\nBecause of the widely publicized control breakdowns at Wells Fargo Bank and recent regulatory actions,\nboards of directors of public companies and financial institutions have been directed to improve oversight and\n2\nScott Vogel. “You Paid for It: AIG’s Retreat Destination, Up Close.” Washington Post.

Boards are evolving from focusing primarily on the needs of top key individuals to\nconsidering broader aspects of ethics, values, and corporate culture. Boards now oversee the monitoring\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\n•\nconfirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\n•\nverifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\n•\nensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\nverifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\n•\ncoordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\n48\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPepsiCo\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry. It has also been noted for its excellence in\ncorporate governance. Take a look at the PepsiCo website (https://openstax.org/r/pepsico). Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long\nway to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most",

This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate\nactions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,\nand ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\nInvestors versus Creditors\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\npossible default.\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\nstakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.\nIf such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the\norganization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the\ncompany as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus\nother stakeholders.\nA more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift\nbasket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.4 This was a direct result of the company\nbeing purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of\ndebt. However, the most important factor leading to the company’s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer,\nwho was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant\nexecutive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry & David has since emerged\nfrom bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen\nwhen stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate\nenvironment.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nInfamous Agency Problems\nEnron\nEnron is one particularly infamous example of an agency problem.

When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any\ngulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it\nis recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also\nrecognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.\nImpact of ESG Ratings\nIn recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being\nevaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These ratings and\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies.

It is critical for the senior management\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\nwhen necessary.\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\ncompany. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to\n2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards\n53\nrepresent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term\nvalue of company stock.\nThus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a\npoor rating can have a negative impact on a firm’s share price and result in substantial problems. In any case,\nit is important to note that ESG is only a starting point from which it is possible to gather indicators on a\nbusiness and its direction.

SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial\nscandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier.\nIn summary, investor relations functions have responsibilities including, but not limited to,\n•\ncoordinating live shareholder meetings and press conferences;\n•\ndisseminating financial information to the investment community;\n•\nconducting briefings to the financial analyst community;\n•\npublishing the quarterly report and annual report; and\n•\naddressing any issues that arise as a result of financial disclosure.\nThe best time to form an internal IR function or to engage an IR firm is when a company begins the process of\nbecoming publicly traded through an initial public offering, or IPO.\nQuarterly Earnings Conference Calls\nAs a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all publicly traded companies are required to file certain\n54\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfinancial reports with the SEC. The underlying purpose of these requirements is to provide shareholders and\nthe investment community with important operational and financial information on a regular basis and in a\ntransparent manner. Reports filed with the SEC include the annual Form 10-K, quarterly Form 10-Qs, and\ncurrent periodic Form 8-Ks, in addition to proxy reports and certain shareholder and affiliate reporting\ndocuments. Quarterly 10-Qs are an ongoing and regular reporting requirement of publicly traded companies\nand are to be filed within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.\nDepending on a company’s size and the complexity of its operation, a firm is likely to issue an earnings press\nrelease and conduct a conference call with the investment community within this same 45-day period.

For effective investor relations,\nkey messages supporting any ownership or potential investment case should be clear and consistent. These\nkey messages should be embedded within the company’s materials and should form the basis of\npresentations, the corporate website, and annual reports.

                    "answer": "Investor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm’s IR group must work very closely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team, such as the CEO and CFO. As might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely due to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IR became significantly more important in 2002, when the United States Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act. This legislation resulted in requirements that dramatically increased the extent of financial reporting for any publicly traded company. SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial scandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier. In summary, investor relations functions have responsibilities including, but not limited to, • coordinating live shareholder meetings and press conferences; • disseminating financial information to the investment community; • conducting briefings to the financial analyst community; • publishing the quarterly report and annual report; and • addressing any issues that arise as a result of financial disclosure. The best time to form an internal IR function or to engage an IR firm is when a company begins the process of becoming publicly traded through an initial public offering, or IPO."

                    "answer": "Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls As a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all publicly traded companies are required to file certain financial reports with the SEC. The underlying purpose of these requirements is to provide shareholders and the investment community with important operational and financial information on a regular basis and in a transparent manner. Reports filed with the SEC include the annual Form 10-K, quarterly Form 10-Qs, and current periodic Form 8-Ks, in addition to proxy reports and certain shareholder and affiliate reporting documents. Quarterly 10-Qs are an ongoing and regular reporting requirement of publicly traded companies and are to be filed within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter. Depending on a company’s size and the complexity of its operation, a firm is likely to issue an earnings press release and conduct a conference call with the investment community within this same 45-day period. There is no legal requirement for companies to do either of these things, but experts in IR view these communications tools as best practice. They can add context and commentary to the reported financial results. It is important for companies to do their planning and not enter a quarterly earnings conference call unprepared. There is a multitude of available resources for companies to analyze and review in preparation. Among such resources are industry reports prepared by government agencies; the financial reports and earnings calls of competing organizations, both within and outside of a company’s primary industry; and financial research reports prepared by various covering analysts, who follow the specific company and are employed by financial brokerage firms."

Additionally, it is important for a\ncompany’s senior management to end any meeting with feedback from the investor audience and set\ntimelines for follow-up. There will always be times when something unexpected may happen and the addition\nof information or impromptu changes to scheduled agendas may occur. It is at times like these when\nunderstanding the body language and facial expressions of an audience can be critical in producing a\nfavorable outcome of the meeting.\nIt is unlikely that the decision to invest or to remain an investor will be made based on a single corporate\nevent, but impressions, good or bad, will certainly factor into such decisions over a period of time. Thus, it is\nimportant for IR officers to understand the importance of follow-up communication with their audience.\nPurposes of Corporate Press Releases\nPress releases have always been a vital tool in the communications toolkit of an IR professional. Various social\nmedia channels are also becoming increasingly popular for delivering company information and news.\nHowever, the press release remains a standard medium for most companies to communicate corporate news,\nresults, and ideas.\nPress releases can be written with various intentions. Whether to release financial information, unveil new\nproducts or services, announce changes in management, or a host of other reasons, all communications have\na different objective. Not all press releases are created equally, and they have varying degrees of effectiveness.\nAny press release should contain information in easy-to-understand language that is free of corporate jargon\nand as concise as possible. Press releases may be viewed by multiple audiences, such as customers,\nstakeholders, investors, potential investors, and the general public, which is vital to consider when drafting a\npress release.\nAccording to PR Newswire statistics, press releases that contain multimedia content have been known to\nsubstantially increase press release views.5 Using infographics and charts where possible and relaying the key\nmessages in short, easy-to-digest points make a press release easier for the reader to take in. Quotes from\nsenior management can provide valuable insight, but they should not provide any new information; they\nshould simply extend or expand on a subject already mentioned and further back up a claim.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPress Releases Approved by PR Newswire\nTake a look at this press release on mobile drive-in movies during the COVID-19 pandemic\n(https://openstax.org/r/mobile-drive-in-movies).\nHow would you judge this press release?

However, after your hunger has been\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\npurchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing. This assumption is, as\nmentioned above, ceteris paribus.\nIf another relevant economic factor changes, the demand curve can change. Relevant economic factors would\ninclude consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price\nof other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza\nnight for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase.\nIf the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher. The\ndemand schedule for pizzas might look like Table 3.2 after an increase in the price of hamburgers.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n9\n25\n19\n20\n29\n15\n39\n10\n49\n5\n59\nTable 3.2 Demand\nSchedule for Pizzas\nafter the Price of\nHamburgers Doubles\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n69\nThis change leads to a movement in the demand curve—outward to the right, as shown in Figure 3.3. This is\nknown as an increase in demand. Now, at a price of $25, people will purchase 19 pizzas instead of 10; and at a\nprice of $15, people will purchase 39 pizzas instead of 30.\nFigure 3.3 An Increase in Demand Represented as a Movement of the Demand Curve to the Right\nA decrease in demand would cause the demand curve to move to the left. This could happen if people’s tastes\nand preferences changed. If there were, for example, increased publicity about pizza being an unhealthy food\nchoice, some individuals would choose healthier alternatives and consume less pizza.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDemand Curve Shifts\nIf any of the items that are assumed not to change when a demand curve is drawn do change, then the\ndemand curve can shift. To learn more about these changes in demand, watch the MRU video on demand\ncurve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video).\nSupply\nSupply is the quantity of a good or service that firms are willing to sell at various prices, during a given time\nperiod, ceteris paribus. Table 3.3 is a fictional example of a supply schedule for pizzas. In some cases, higher\nprices encourage producers to provide more of their product for sale. Thus, there is a positive relationship\nbetween the price and quantity supplied.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n60\n25\n50\n20\n40\n15\n30\n10\n20\n5\n10\nTable 3.3 Supply\nSchedule for Pizzas\n70\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates",

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form\nof\nMXN is an abbreviation for the Mexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known\nas a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nBecause this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as the spot\nexchange rate.\nIf you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.\nSimply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:\nIf you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy\ndollars. Each US dollar will cost you MXN 16.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCurrency Conversion\nDo you want to know how many British pounds your $100 would buy? Or would you like to see how much\nthat 10,000-yen-per-night hotel room will cost you in your home currency? You can enter the amount of one\ncurrency in the MSN Money currency converter (https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter) to see what the\nequivalent amount is in another currency.\nCurrency Appreciation\nJust as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the\ngas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates\n89\nCurrency prices are determined in the marketplace through the same types of supply-and-demand forces we\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\nCurrency Depreciation\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was\n, it\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\ndepreciate.\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\nExchange Rate Risk\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk. As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange",

The\nsteep drop in 2020 highlights the economic decline associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at the\nchart, it is easy to see that after 10 years of a general upward trend, Japan’s GDP quickly fell to a level not seen\nin the previous decade as COVID-19 began spreading in early 2020.\nFigure 3.19 Real Gross Domestic Product for Japan, 2010–202013\nThe vertical axis in Figure 3.19 is measured in yen. Over the time period shown, the real GDP ranged from 500\ntrillion yen to 560 trillion yen. The general trend (until COVID-19) was upward, indicating growth in the\nJapanese economy. However, the growth was not consistent from year to year.\nFigure 3.20 also contains information about Japanese real GDP from 2010 to 2020.

            "chunk": "and when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\n102\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexpense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\nWho Uses Each Method?\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is\nreceived). Cash can often be received a significant amount of time after the initial transaction. Considering this\namount allows accountants to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and complete information to stakeholders.\nThere are several reasons accrual-basis accounting is preferred to cash-basis accounting. Accrual-basis\naccounting is required by GAAP because it typically provides a better sense of the financial well-being of a\ncompany. Accrual-based accounting information allows management to analyze a company’s progress, and\nmanagement can use that information to improve their business. Accrual accounting is also used to assist\ncompanies in securing financing because banks will typically require a company to provide accrual-basis\nfinancial income statements. The Internal Revenue Service requires businesses to report using accrual-basis\ninformation when preparing tax returns. In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based\naccounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.\nSo why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-\nbasis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from\nsuch requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?",

Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?\nYou are a new accountant at a beauty salon. The salon had previously used cash-basis accounting to\nprepare its financial records but is now considering switching to an accrual-basis method. You have been\ntasked with determining if this transition is appropriate.\nWhen you go through the records, you notice that this transition will greatly impact how the salon reports\nrevenues and expenses. The salon will now report some revenues and expenses before it receives or pays\ncash.\nHow will this change positively impact its business reporting? How will it negatively impact its business\nreporting? If you were the accountant, would you recommend the salon transition from cash basis to\naccrual basis?\nSolution:\nAccrual accounting creates a more accurate picture of profit or loss, so the salon’s owner can have a better\nunderstanding of its profitability from period to period. However, it can be more work to record under\naccrual accounting. If the salon is small and the profits and costs are easily understood, it might not be\nworth the extra effort to the owner to use accrual-basis accounting. If the salon is seeking ways to better\nunderstand profits and costs, accrual-basis accounting would be a great choice.\n4.1 • Cash versus Accrual Accounting\n103\n4.2\nEconomic Basis for Accrual Accounting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nAssess the impact of business transactions on cash flow.\n•\nDefine double-entry accounting and explain how it supports the accounting equation.\nHow and when we record our transactions can have a significant impact on financial statements, especially the\nincome statement (net income). In this section you will explore the impact business transactions have on\nfinancial statements under each method. In doing so, you’ll be introduced to double-entry accounting and\nsee how it functions to support the accounting equation.\nTiming of Business Activity versus Cash Flow\nThe first financial statement prepared is the income statement, a statement that shows the organization’s\nfinancial performance for a given period of time. We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a\nsummer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used\nthe cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was\nusing her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance\ncosts. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.\nThis balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and\ninsurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\n104\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSeptember rather than in August. In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,\na result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,",

If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s\ntractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset. Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash\nfor all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0. Using the\naccounting equation, we find her equity to currently be $250, or\nDouble-Entry Accounting\nAccounting is based on a double-entry accounting system, which requires the following:\n•\nEach time we record a transaction, we must record a change in at least two different accounts. Having two\nor more accounts change will allow us to keep the accounting equation in balance.\n•\nNot only will at least two accounts change, but there must also be at least one debit and one credit side\nimpacted.\n•\nThe sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits for each transaction.\nIn order for companies to record the myriad of transactions they have each year, there is a need for a simple\nbut detailed system. Journals are useful tools to meet this need.\nDebits and Credits\nEach account can be represented visually by splitting the account into left and right sides as shown. The\ngraphic representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-account. It is called this because it looks\nlike a “T,” as you can see with the T-account shown in Figure 4.3.\nFigure 4.3 T-Account\nA debit records financial information on the left side of each account. A credit records financial information on\nthe right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease. The\nending account balance is found by calculating the difference between debits and credits for each account.\nYou will often see the terms debit and credit represented in shorthand, written as DR or dr and CR or cr,\nrespectively. Depending on the account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary. We can illustrate\neach account type and its corresponding debit and credit effects in the form of an expanded equation (see\nFigure 4.4).\n106\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 4.4 Expanded Accounting Equation\nAs we can see from this expanded accounting equation, Assets accounts increase on the debit side and\ndecrease on the credit side. This is also true of Dividends and Expenses accounts. Liabilities increase on the\ncredit side and decrease on the debit side. This is also true of Common Stock and Revenues accounts. This\nbecomes easier to understand as you become familiar with the normal balance of an account.\nThe balance sheet is a reflection of the accounting equation (see Figure 4.5). It has two sections, assets in one\nsection and liabilities and equity in the other section. It’s key to note that both assets and liabilities are broken\ndown on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to provide more detail and\ntransparency. Current assets are those that are consumed within a year. Assets that will be in use longer than\na year are considered noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be due within a year. Noncurrent\nliabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future.\nFigure 4.5 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\nnoncurrent. Also highlighted are the various activities that affect the equity (or net worth) of the business.\nNotice each account subcategory (Current Assets and Noncurrent Assets, for example) has an “increase” side\nand a “decrease” side. As you may recall, these are called T-accounts, and they are used to analyze\ntransactions.\nThe basic components of even the simplest accounting system are accounts and a general ledger. An account\nis a record showing increases and decreases to assets, liabilities, and equity—the basic components found in\nthe accounting equation. Each of these categories, in turn, includes many individual accounts, all of which a\ncompany maintains in its general ledger. A general ledger is a comprehensive listing of all of a company’s\naccounts with their individual balances.\n4.3\nHow Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the revenue recognition principle and how it relates to current and future sales transactions.\n•\nExplain the expense recognition principle and how it relates to current and future purchase transactions.\n•\nAssess the role of ethics in revenue and expense recognition.",

Similarly, if a company incurs expenses on a contract basis, it may need to estimate the amount of expenses that will be incurred over the life of the contract. In both cases, the expense recognition principle requires companies to make estimates about the amount of expenses that will be incurred in the future and record it in their financial statements."

                    "question": "What is the role of ethics in revenue and expense recognition?",
                    "answer": "Ethics plays a significant role in revenue and expense recognition because it is important for companies to accurately reflect the economic reality of their transactions in their financial statements. This means that companies should not manipulate their financial statements to make them appear more favorable than they actually are. For example, companies should not recognize revenue before it is earned or recognize expenses after they have been incurred. Similarly, companies should not manipulate their financial statements by recognizing revenue or expenses that do not actually exist. This can be challenging because companies may be under pressure to meet certain financial targets or to make their financial statements appear more favorable than they actually are. In these cases, it is important for companies to have strong ethical standards and to ensure that their financial statements accurately reflect the economic reality of their transactions."

On the right, the same credit\nsale is recorded under the accrual basis of accounting.\nLet’s now explore the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting using an expense.\n108\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAssume a business purchases $160 worth of printing supplies from a supplier (vendor). Similar to a sale, a\npurchase of merchandise can be paid for at the time of sale using cash (also a check or credit card) or at a later\ndate (on account). A purchase paid with cash at the time of the sale would be recorded in the financial\nstatements under both cash basis and accrual basis of accounting. It makes sense because the business\nreceived the printing supplies from the supplier and paid the supplier at the same time. It is considered two\nevents that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nIf the purchase was made on account (also called a credit purchase), however, the transaction would be\nrecorded differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash basis of accounting, the $160\npurchase on account would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is paid, as stipulated by\nthe seller’s terms. For example, if the printing supplies were received on July 17 and the payment terms were\n15 days, no transaction would be recorded until August 1, when the goods were paid for. Under the accrual\nbasis of accounting, this purchase would be recorded in the financial statements at the time the business\nreceived the printing supplies from the supplier (July 17). The reason the purchase would be recorded is that\nthe business reports that it bought $160 worth of printing supplies from its vendors. The fact that the business\nwill pay later is viewed as a separate issue under accrual accounting. Table 4.1 summarizes these examples\nunder the different bases of accounting.\nTransaction\nUnder Cash-Basis Accounting\nUnder Accrual-Basis Accounting\n$200 sale for cash\nRecorded in financial statements at time of\nsale\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof sale\n$200 sale on\naccount\nNot recorded in financial statements until\ncash is received\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof sale\n$160 purchase for\ncash\nRecorded in financial statements at time of\npurchase\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof purchase\n$160 purchase on\naccount\nNot recorded in financial statements until\ncash is paid\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof purchase\nTable 4.1 How Transactions Are Viewed under Cash and Accrual Accounting\nBusinesses often sell items for cash as well as on account, where payment terms are extended for a period of\ntime (for example, 30 to 45 days). Likewise, businesses often purchase items from suppliers (also called\nvendors) for cash or, more likely, on account. Under the cash basis of accounting, these transactions would not\nbe recorded until the cash is exchanged. In contrast, under accrual accounting, the transactions are recorded\nwhen the transaction occurs, regardless of when the cash is received or paid.\n4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\n109\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEthics in Revenue Recognition\nBecause each industry typically has a different method for recognizing income, revenue recognition is one\nof the most difficult tasks for accountants, as it involves a number of ethical dilemmas related to income\nreporting. To provide an industry-wide approach, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 and other\nrelated updates were implemented to clarify revenue recognition rules. The American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\nrevenue recognition.\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses.

They have given you the\nfollowing list and asked for your help to sort through it.

Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it\nis expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs\nover its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s\nfinancial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in\nexpenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense\nrecognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the\nrevenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over\nthe years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.\nAs stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated\ncosts on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,\nthey will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry in Figure 4.8).\nFigure 4.8 Journal Entry for Machine/Cash\nWhen capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This\nincludes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.\nFor example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the\nland would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.\nOver time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the\nasset.\n3\nIn the Chapter 4 financial statements, a number contained within parentheses is a negative number, such as the “Accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization” line item.\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\n113\nWhat Is Depreciation?\nWhen a business purchases a long-term asset (used for more than one year), it classifies the asset based on\nwhether the asset is used in the business’s operations. If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\ntypically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.",

Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\nestimated useful life.\nRecording the Initial Asset\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years. The journal entry to\nrecord the purchase is shown in Figure 4.10.\n114\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 4.10 Journal Entry for Equipment/Cash\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating Useful Life and Salvage Value\nUseful life and salvage value are estimates made at the time an asset is placed in service. It is common and\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\nand increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined\nby the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and\noverstate net income by $1.7 billion.4\nComponents Used in Calculating Depreciation\nThe expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful\nlife is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we\nwould allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\n$10,000.",

Liam pays shipping costs of $1,500\nand setup costs of $2,500 and assumes a useful life of five years or 960,000 prints. Based on experience, Liam\nanticipates a salvage value of $10,000. Recall that determination of the costs to be depreciated requires\nincluding all costs that prepare the asset for use by the company. Liam’s example would include shipping and\nsetup costs. Any costs for maintaining or repairing the equipment would be treated as regular expenses, so\nthe total cost would be $58,000, and after allowing for an anticipated salvage value of $10,000 in five years, the\nbusiness could take $48,000 in depreciation over the machine’s economic life (see Figure 4.12).\nFigure 4.12 Purchase Price and Depreciable Base\nStraight-line depreciation is a method of depreciation that evenly splits the depreciable amount across the\nuseful life of the asset. Therefore, we must determine the yearly depreciation expense by dividing the\ndepreciable base of $48,000 by the economic life of five years, giving an annual depreciation expense of\n$9,600. The journal entries to record the first two years of expenses are shown, along with the balance sheet\ninformation. Here are the journal entry and information for year one (Figure 4.13):\nFigure 4.13 Journal Entry for Silk Screen Machine Depreciation Expense, Year 1\nAfter the journal entry in year one, the machine would have a book value of $48,400. This is the original cost of\n$58,000 less the accumulated depreciation of $9,600. The journal entry and information for year two are shown\nin Figure 4.14.\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\n117\nFigure 4.14 Journal Entry for Silk Screen Machine Depreciation Expense, Year 2\nLiam records an annual depreciation expense of $9,600. Each year, the accumulated depreciation balance\nincreases by $9,600, and the machine’s book value decreases by the same $9,600. At the end of five years, the\nasset will have a book value of $10,000, which is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation of\nfrom the cost of $58,000.\nUnits-of-Production Depreciation\nStraight-line depreciation is efficient accounting for assets used consistently over their lifetime, but what about\nassets that are used with less regularity? The units-of-production depreciation method bases depreciation on\nthe actual usage of the asset, which is more appropriate when an asset’s life is a function of usage instead of\ntime. For example, this method could account for depreciation of a silk screen machine for which the\ndepreciable base is $48,000 (as in the straight-line method), but now the number of prints is important.\nIn our example, the machine will have total depreciation of $48,000 over its useful life of 960,000 prints.\nTherefore, we would divide $48,000 by 960,000 prints to get a cost per print of $0.05. If Liam printed 180,000\nitems in the first year, the depreciation expense would be\n. The\njournal entry to record this expense would be the same as with straight-line depreciation: only the dollar\namount would have changed. The presentation of accumulated depreciation and the calculation of the book\nvalue would also be the same. Liam would continue to depreciate the asset until a total of $48,000 in\ndepreciation was taken after running 960,000 total prints.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nDeciding on a Depreciation Method\nLiam is struggling to determine which deprecation method they should use for their new silk screen\nmachine. They expect sales to increase over the next five years. They also expect (hope) that in two years\nthey will need to buy a second silk screen machine to keep up with the demand for products of their\ngrowing company. Which depreciation method makes more sense for Liam: higher expenses in the first few\nyears or keeping expenses consistent over time? Or would it be better for them to think not in terms of\ntime, but rather in the usage of the machine?\nDouble-Declining-Balance Depreciation\nThe double-declining-balance depreciation method is the most complex of the three methods because it\naccounts for both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few years of the asset’s life.

Double\ndeclining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under\nstraight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a\nfive-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year.\nNext, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-\n118\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndeclining method takes usage into account by doubling the straight-line percentage. For a four-year asset,\nmultiply 25 percent\n, or 50 percent. For a five-year asset, multiply 20 percent\n, or 40 percent.\nOne unique feature of the double-declining-balance method is that in the first year, the estimated salvage\nvalue is not subtracted from the total asset cost before calculating the first year’s depreciation expense.\nInstead, the total cost is multiplied by the calculated percentage. However, depreciation expense is not\npermitted to take the book value below the estimated salvage value, as demonstrated in Figure 4.15.\nFigure 4.15 Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation, and Book Value, Years 1–5\nNotice that in year four, the remaining book value of $12,528 was not multiplied by 40 percent. This is because\nthe expense would have been $5,011.20, and since we cannot depreciate the asset below the estimated\nsalvage value of $10,000, the expense cannot exceed $2,528, which is the amount left to depreciate (difference\nbetween the book value of $12,528 and the salvage value of $10,000). Since the asset has been depreciated to\nits salvage value at the end of year four, no depreciation can be taken in year five.\nIn our example, the first year’s double-declining-balance depreciation expense would be\n. For the remaining years, the double-declining percentage is multiplied by the\nremaining book value of the asset. Liam would continue to depreciate the asset until the book value and the\nestimated salvage value are the same (in this case, $10,000). The net effect of the differences in straight-line\ndepreciation versus double-declining-balance depreciation is that under the double-declining-balance method,\nthe allowable depreciation expenses are greater in the earlier years than those allowed for straight-line\ndepreciation. However, over the depreciable life of the asset, the total depreciation expense taken will be the\nsame no matter which method the entity chooses.

Note that although each time-based\n(straight-line and double-declining balance) annual depreciation expense is different, after five years the total\namount depreciated (accumulated depreciation) is the same. This occurs because at the end of the asset’s\nuseful life, it was expected to be worth $10,000: thus, both methods depreciated the asset’s value by $48,000\nover that time period.\nDepreciation\nMethod\nCalculation\nStraight line\nUnits of\nproduction\nDouble-\ndeclining\nbalance\nTable 4.2 Three Methods of Calculating Depreciation Expense\nFigure 4.16 Straight-Line Depreciation, Units of Production, Double-Declining Balance Method, Years 1–5\nWhen analyzing depreciation, accountants are required to make a supportable estimate of an asset’s useful\nlife and its salvage value.

                    "answer": "The double-declining-balance depreciation method is the most complex of the three methods because it accounts for both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few years of the asset’s life. Double declining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under straight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a five-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year. Next, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-declining method takes usage into account by doubling the straight-line percentage. For a four-year asset, multiply 25 percent, or 50 percent. For a five-year asset, multiply 20 percent, or 40 percent. One unique feature of the double-declining-balance method is that in the first year, the estimated salvage value is not subtracted from the total asset cost before calculating the first year’s depreciation expense. Instead, the total cost is multiplied by the calculated percentage. However, depreciation expense is not permitted to take the book value below the estimated salvage value, as demonstrated in Figure 4.15."

However, over the depreciable life of the asset, the total depreciation expense taken will be the same no matter which method the entity chooses.

While\nbusinesses work hard to avoid net loss situations, it is not uncommon for a company to sustain a net loss from\ntime to time. It is difficult, however, for businesses to remain viable while experiencing net losses over the long\nterm.\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function is:\nTo be complete, we must also consider the impact of gains and losses. While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\nProfit versus Cash Flow\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the\nneed for the statement of cash flows. Stakeholders need to know the financial performance (as measured by\nthe income statement—that is, net income or net loss) and financial position (as measured by the balance\nsheet—that is, assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) of the business. This information is provided in the\nincome statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. However, since these financial statements\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing.

The same is true on the expenses side. An expense can be incurred, such as an electric bill, but cash\nmay not have been paid out yet. Thus, an expense is recorded and recognized on the income statement, but\ncash has not yet been given up. The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net\nincome (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.\n4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\n123\nSummary\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\naccounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash\nbasis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.\n4.2 Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\nDouble-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts\nimpacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual-basis accounting\nan accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\nwhen paid\ncapitalize\nthe process in which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet and its allocated costs are\nexpensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life\ncash-basis accounting\na method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash\ncredit\na record of financial information on the right side of an account\ndebit\na record of financial information on the left side of each account\n124\n4 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndepreciation\nthe process of allocating the costs of a tangible asset over the asset’s economic life\ndouble-entry accounting\nan accounting method that requires the sum of the debits to equal the sum of the\ncredits for each transaction\nexpense\na cost associated with providing goods or services\nexpense recognition\n(also, matching principle) matches expenses with associated revenues in the period in\nwhich the revenues were generated\ngains\nincreases in organizational value from activities that are “incidental or peripheral” to the primary\npurpose of the business\nincome statement",

The company’s\noperating expenses are deducted from gross profit to arrive at operating income\nWhile gross profit reflects only how profitable the firm was in making its core product, operating income\n5.1 • The Income Statement\n131\nreflects how profitable the firm’s daily operations were as a whole. This still does not include other\nmiscellaneous items outside the scope of a firm’s normal business. Just as the name implies, it shows income\nfrom the core operations of the firm.\nFigure 5.3 Income Statement through Income from Operations\nWe can see that the company was able to generate\nmore in net sales in the\ncurrent year than the prior year. However, it only generated\nin gross profit and\nof additional operating income. Further investigation shows that while net sales\nincreased, so did the direct costs of its goods (COGS) and its operating expenses.\nWe will further explore how to assess each of these expenses later in the chapter using common-size analysis.\nCommon-size analysis reflects each element of a financial statement as a percentage of the base. In the case\nof the income statement, the base is net sales. Here we would see that COGS was 50 percent of net sales in\nboth the current\nand prior year\n, indicating there wasn’t any significant\nchange in performance we could detect from the information provided in the income statement.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nOperating Expenses\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Review Apple’s\noperating income for the last few years. Has it improved or declined? Does this fall in line with your\nexpectations based on your previous review of the company’s net sales and gross profit?\nBased on the improvement or decline in operating income, review Apple’s operating expenses to\ninvestigate. Have any of the operating expenses changed significantly? How did that impact the company’s\noperating income? What might it tell you about the company’s performance?\nNet Income\nFinally, we move on to net income, or what is commonly referred to as the bottom line. Net income (or loss)\nreflects the net impact of all financial transactions for the firm, including those that are caused by events\noutside the normal course of business. The most common items deducted from operating income to arrive at\nnet income include interest expense, gains/losses, and income tax expense. Remember, gains and losses are\nthose that result from unusual transactions outside the normal course of business. Examples include selling a\npiece of old equipment or a loss on retiring debt.\nWe can see in Figure 5.4 that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has outstanding debt, so it incurred interest expense\n132\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof $2,000 in the current year and $3,000 the prior year. Since it recorded net income (not a loss), it must also\nrecord income tax expense of $6,000 in the current and $5,000 in the prior year.\nFigure 5.4 Comparative Year-End Income Statement",

It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\nflows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n143\nconsumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect. FASB (Financial Accounting\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and",

Common items in this\nsection of the statement include the payment of dividends, issuance of common or preferred stock, and\nissuance or payment of notes payable (see Figure 5.18).\nIn the current year, Clear Lake took out additional notes payable (a cash inflow). We can see this by the\nincrease in their notes payable account from the prior year to current year ($40,000 to $50,000). This is an\ninflow of cash and thus an increase on the statement. Dividends of $30,000 were paid to shareholders (found\non the statement of retained earnings and the statement of owner’s equity). Finally, we see that Clear Lake\nmust have issued additional common stock, as their common stock balance increased from $75,000 to $80,000.\nFigure 5.18 Financing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\n146\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStatement of Cash Flows\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

This amount is then used to adjust the beginning cash balance from the balance sheet.\nAssuming the statement was prepared correctly, the sum should equal the ending cash balance on the\nbalance sheet.\nIn the full statement, we can see that Clear Lake has net cash flow of $20,000. The beginning cash balance was\n$90,000, making the ending cash balance $110,000 (see Figure 5.19).\nFigure 5.19 Full Statement of Cash Flows\nAnalyzing Performance\nThe statement of cash flows can be used in a number of ways to assess firm performance by both internal and\nexternal financial statement users. Internal users can assess sources of and uses of cash in order to aid in\nadapting, as necessary, to ensure adequate future cash flows. External users also use the statement. Recall\nthat comparing net income to operational cash flows can help assess the quality of earnings. In the next\nsection you’ll explore operating cash flow and free cash flow to the firm, two key points of analysis in\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n147\nassessing cash flows.\n5.6\nOperating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate operating cash flow and free cash flow.\n•\nAssess organizational cash management performance.\nOperating Cash Flow\nNow that we have a statement of cash flows prepared, we can move on to a few key elements of the statement\nused to assess organizational cash management performance. Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key",

Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task. A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements. Common-size financial statements, also termed vertical analysis,\nrestate the financial statement items as a percentage of a base item. Doing so helps reveal relationships\nbetween items, aids in assessing performance over time, and makes it easier to compare one company to\nanother, regardless of size (thus the name common-size).\n5.7\nCommon-Size Statements\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nPrepare common-size statements.\n•\nAssess organizational performance using common-size statements.\n•\nUse industry comparisons to assess organizational performance.\nCommon-Size Income Statements\nA common-size income statement is created by restating each line as a percentage of net sales. Expressing\neach item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to\nmake comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes. The formula to calculate\neach item on the income statement is:\nUsing Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year income statement, we can see how each line item in it is divided\nby net sales in order to assemble a common-size income statement (see Figure 5.20).\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n149\nFigure 5.20 Common-Size Income Statement\nIt may seem cumbersome to create a common-size statement.

This makes it easier to compare figures from one period to the next,\ncompare departments within an organization, and compare the firm to other companies of any size as well as\nindustry averages. On the income statement, analysts can see how much of sales revenue is spent on each\ntype of expense. They can see this breakdown for each firm and compare how different firms function in terms\nof expenses, proportionally. They can also look at the percentage for each expense over time to see if they are\nspending more or less on certain areas of the business, such as research and development. On the balance\nsheet, analysts commonly look to see the percentage of debt and equity to determine capital structure. They\ncan also quickly see the percentage of current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities.\nIn Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement for the current and prior years, we can see that\ncost of goods as a percentage of sales remained the same (see Figure 5.24). This means that while sales\n152\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nincreased, so did cost of goods sold, but it increased at the same proportion as sales. No improvement or\ndecline occurred in the company’s cost of goods sold. The same is true for rent, depreciation, and utilities\nexpenses. One key item did change slightly as a percentage: salaries expense. The 2 percent decrease in\noperating income from the prior year’s 38 percent to the current year’s 36 percent was caused by the increase\nin salaries expense as a percentage of sales.\nNet income, however, only declined by 1 percent from 30 percent in the prior year to 29 percent in the current\nyear because interest expense dropped by 1 percent, offsetting the 2 percent increase in salaries expense.\nFigure 5.24 Common-Size Income Statement\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCommon-Size Income Statement\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

The same is true for rent, depreciation, and utilities expenses. One key item did change slightly as a percentage: salaries expense.

In the prior year, the balance sheet reflected 55 percent debt and 45 percent equity. In the current\nyear, that balance shifted to 60 percent debt and 40 percent equity. The firm did issue additional stock and\nshowed an increase in retained earnings, both totaling a $10,000 increase in equity. However, the equity\nincrease was much smaller than the total increase in liabilities of $40,000. Long-term debt increased by only\n$10,000 by issuing additional notes payable. The remainder of that increase is seen in the 5 percent increase in\ncurrent liabilities. In that increase, most of it was in unearned revenue.\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n153\nFigure 5.25 Common-Size Balance Sheet\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCommon-Size Assets and Common-Size Liabilities and Equity\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Charlie is a much bigger retailer for outdoor gear, as\nCharlie has nearly seven times greater sales than Clear Lake. Common-size statements allow Clear Lake to\ncompare their statements in a meaningful way (see Figure 5.26). Notice that Clear Lake spends 50 percent of\nits sales on cost of goods sold while Charlie spends 59 percent. This is a significant difference that would be an\nindicator that Clear Lake and Charlie have key differences in their operations, purchasing policies, or general\nperformance in their core products.\n154\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nWe know that Charlie is a bigger retailer, and we see this clearly in the rent expense as a percentage of sales.\nCharlie spends 11 percent of its sales on building rent, while Clear Lake spends only 5 percent. A clear\ndifference in performance is hinted at here, alluding to Charlie spending more per square foot on rent or using\nits retail space differently, causing it to rent more space for its product per sales dollar than Clear Lake does.\nDepreciation expense, though not a large figure, is smaller for Charlie, giving us a hint that Charlie has less\ncapital equipment than Clear Lake, perhaps tied to the higher rent expense. It is possible that Charlie rents\nsome of its equipment, which would help explain the higher rent percentage. Finally, Charlie’s salaries\npercentage is significantly higher at 12 percent than Clear Lake’s 5 percent. Though the simple percentage\ndoes not tell us why, it does provide us a hint and allow for further questions or investigation. Charlie may pay\nits employees a much higher wage than Clear Lake. They may also have far more sales associates on the floor\nin their larger spaces than Clear Lake does in their smaller retail spaces.\nNote that although we have compared just two years of data for Charlie and Clear Lake, it is more common to\nuse several years of data to get a more robust view of long-term trends.\nFigure 5.26 Comparison of Common-Size Income Statements\nLINK TO LEARNING\nMicrosoft versus Apple\nLocate the sales, cost of goods sold, and gross profit data for Microsoft (https://openstax.org/r/microsoft-\nfinancial)’s most current period using Yahoo!

How often are they prepared? Who gets them? In this next section we will explore the\nrequirements for what needs to be reported, when, and to whom.\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n155\n5.8\nReporting Financial Activity\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the most common types of accounting periods.\n•\nOutline key considerations and accounting principles that dictate the timing of financial reporting.\n•\nDescribe the SEC reporting requirements relevant to financial statements.\n•\nIdentify the key elements of a company annual report.\nDefining Accounting Periods\nAn accounting period can be any period of time, but the most common accounting periods are months,\nquarters, and a year. Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Fiscal years are often different from the calendar year, which runs from January 1 to December 31. Fiscal years can start on any day of the year, and they can be either 12 or 13 months long. The most common fiscal year start date is October 1, but other start dates include April 1, July 1, and September 1. Fiscal years are used to report financial data to stakeholders such as investors and creditors. They are also used to determine tax liability."

The company should also consider its past experience and how it corresponds to current and\nfuture performance expectations.\nImportance of Ratios and Analysis\nFinancial ratios help internal and external stakeholders make informed decisions about actions like investing,\nbecoming a supplier, making a loan, or altering internal operations, among other things. The information\nresulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success,\nset budget expectations, and compare industry competitors. There are four main types of ratios: liquidity,\nsolvency, efficiency, and profitability. While outcomes for some ratios may seem more ideal, the industry in\nwhich the business operates can change the influence of these outcomes on stakeholder decisions.\nThere are several benefits to analyzing financial statements. The information can show trends over time, which\ncan help in making future business decisions. Converting information to percentages or ratios eliminates\nsome of the disparities between competitors’ sizes and operating abilities, making it easier for stakeholders to\nmake informed decisions. It can assist with understanding the makeup of current operations within the\nbusiness and which shifts need to occur internally to increase productivity.\nLimitation of Financial Statement Analysis\nThough useful, it’s important to note that there are limitations to financial statement analysis as well.\nStakeholders need to remember that past performance does not always predict future performance. Economic\ninfluences, such as inflation or a recession, could skew the data being analyzed. Additionally, the way a\ncompany reports information may change over time. For example, there could be changes in where and when\ncertain transactions are recorded, and this may not be immediately evident to financial statement users. It is\nalso key to note that though all publicly traded companies in the United States are required to follow Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), there are many estimates and flexibility in how some standards are\napplied. This means that firms can still follow accounting standards appropriately but present some\ninformation differently from other firms.\nIt makes good sense for a company to use financial statement analysis to guide future operations so it can\n166\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbudget properly, control costs, increase revenues, and make long-term expenditure decisions. As long as\nstakeholders understand the limitations of financial statement analysis, it is a useful way to predict growth and\nfinancial strength.\nDespite limitations, ratios are still a valuable tool if used appropriately.

Both the balance\nsheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on\nthe preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares\noutstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period.

Its importance is accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies to report earnings per\nshare on the face of a company’s income statement. This is the only ratio that requires such prominent\nreporting. If fact, public companies are required to report two different earnings per share amounts on their\nincome statements—basic and diluted. We’ve illustrated the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted\nearnings per share, which is not demonstrated here, involves the consideration of all securities, such as stocks\nand bonds, that could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic earnings per share.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFinding Earning per Share for Public Companies\nWhere can you find earnings per share information on public companies?

Or use the search function to search for earnings per\nshare data for your favorite corporation. Enter the ticker for the company you are looking up, and a basic\nchart and graph will display with stock price data along with several commonly used ratios (including\nearnings per share).\nAs you review data, keep in mind that a company can manipulate or impact its earnings per share by\nissuing new shares or buying back issued shares. What are the ethical implications of earnings per share\ncalculations?\nCommon stock shares are normally purchased by investors to generate income through dividends or to sell at\na profit in the future. Investors realize that inadequate earnings per share can result in poor or inconsistent\ndividend payments and fluctuating stock prices. As such, companies seek to produce earnings per share\namounts that rise each period. However, an increase in earnings per share may not always reflect favorable\nperformance, as there are multiple reasons that earnings per share may increase. One way earnings per share\ncan increase is through increased net income. On the other hand, it can also increase when a company buys\nback its own shares of stock.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods generated net income of $30,000 and paid out $3,000 in\n178\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npreferred shareholder dividends last year.

The ratio is helpful in comparing performance and stock price of a company to other\ncompanies. It’s also helpful in evaluating how much investors are willing to pay for earnings performance.\nInvestors, in particular, use this ratio and rely on two key characteristics: past performance (trailing) and\nfuture estimates (forward). Trailing data can be calculated but is also easily found online, as it’s a common\nmeasure reported on financial sites. Investors will often look for P/E TTM, which is the price/earnings ratio for\nthe trailing 12 months (last year worth of earnings data). This helps investors assess one day’s stock price\nrelative to the earnings per share over the past 12 months. P/E ratio is widely used by investors to determine if\na stock is over- or undervalued. It also helps them compare one firm to that of the industry average or index,\nsuch as the S&P 500.\nIn the prior section we saw earnings per share data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Using its current year\nearnings per share of $3.75 and the current stock price of $69.41, we can calculate price/earnings ratio for\nClear Lake Sporting Goods:\nAn 18.51 ratio means an investor would expect to invest $18.51 to gain $1 of earnings.\nBook Value per Share\nBook value per share is often used hand in hand with market value per share. Investors compare the two in\norder to see if the stock is possibly over- or undervalued. Book value is derived from accounting practices and\nshows the value of the firm on paper. Market value, on the other hand, is determined by supply and demand,\nbased on what investors are willing to pay for the stock. If the market value per share is higher than the book\nvalue, the stock is considered overvalued. If the market value is lower than the book value, it’s considered\nundervalued.\nIn theory, book value per share represents the total value common shareholders would receive if the firm\nwere liquidated. It is total equity less preferred equity, spread across the total shares outstanding. The formula\nto calculate book value per share is\nThe book value per share for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is\nIf investors compared the book value per share of $10.00 for Clear Lake Sporting Goods to the P/E ratio of\n$18.51, they would likely conclude that the stock was undervalued in the year of analysis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nBook Value versus Market Value of Shares\nThis video about book value and market value (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-book-value) explains\nthe basic concepts and discusses how the two differ.

The company\nneeds to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,\ncompany revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:\nprofit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.\nProfit Margin\nProfit margin represents how much of sales revenue has translated into income. This ratio shows how much\nof each $1 of sales is returned as profit. The larger the ratio figure (the closer it gets to 1), the more of each\nsales dollar is returned as profit. The portion of the sales dollar not returned as profit goes toward expenses.\nThe formula for profit margin is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the profit margin in the current year is\nThis means that for every dollar of sales, $0.29 returns as profit. If Clear Lake Sporting Goods thinks this is too\nlow, the company would try to find ways to reduce expenses and increase sales.\nReturn on Total Assets\nThe return on total assets measures the company’s ability to use its assets successfully to generate a profit.\nThe higher the return (ratio outcome), the more profit is created from asset use. Average total assets are\nfound by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the balance sheet. The\nbeginning total assets balance in the current year is taken from the ending total assets balance in the prior\nyear. The formula for return on total assets is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the return on total assets for the current year is\nThe higher the figure, the better the company is using its assets to create a profit.

The interest rate is often referred to as the growth rate, or the annual percentage increase on\nsavings or on an investment. When the rate is raised to the power of the number of periods, the formula\nwill yield a number that is commonly referred to as the future value interest factor (FVIF). As a result\nof this process, as n (time, or the number of periods) increases, the future value interest factor will increase.\nAlso, as r (interest rate) increases, the FVIF will increases. For these reasons, the future value calculation is\ndirectly determined by both the interest rate being used and the total amount of time—specifically, the\nnumber of periods—being considered.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Future Values\nHere’s another example of calculating future values in multiple-period scenarios.\nOn a recent drive, you spotted your dream home, which is currently listed at $400,000. Unfortunately, you\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\ncost after six years?\nSolution:\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\nvalue of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn\nor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of\nor $105, in the account at the end of one\nyear.\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\nand five?\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n195\nUsing the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:\nHow the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding\nMelvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in\ninterest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future. His friend suggests finding an\naccount or some form of investment with a greater interest rate than the 5% he can get at his local bank.\nMelvin thinks he can leave his money in an account or investment for a total of five years. He found\ninvestments that will provide annual returns of 6%, 7%, 10%, and 12%. Using the\nformula, we can complete the following calculations for him:\nAgain, Melvin likes this information, and he states that he will try to find the highest interest rate available. This\nmakes sense, but it’s important to remember that investments are usually not guaranteed to earn you specific\ninterest rates, or rates of return. Most investments, other than Treasury investments such as Treasury bonds,\ncarry some form of financial risk, either small or large, and the greater the rate of return, the more likely it is\nthat the risk associated with the investment will also be greater. This risk does not have any effect on the\nfuture calculations we have just completed, but it an important factor to bear in mind and consider well before\nmoving ahead and putting your money in any investment or financial instrument.\n7.3\nMethods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how future dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nExplain how present dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how discount rates are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how growth rates are calculated.\n•\nIllustrate how periods of time for specified growth are calculated.\n•\nUse a financial calculator and Excel to solve TVM problems.\nWe can determine future value by using any of four methods: (1) mathematical equations, (2) calculators with\nfinancial functions, (3) spreadsheets, and (4) FVIF tables.

The FV function syntax is similar to that of the other four\nbasic time-value functions and has the following inputs (referred to as arguments), similar to the functions\nlisted above:\nLump sum problems do not involve payments, so the value of Pmt in such calculations is 0.

Once we know this discount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow's cash flow.

The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest factor (PVIF) and is equal to 1/(1 + r)n. If we know the future value, interest rate, and time period, we can solve for the present value using the formula PV = FV/(1 + r)n. For example, if we know that a future value of $20,000 one year from now will be worth $15,000 today at 5% interest, we can solve for the present value by dividing $20,000 by (1 + 0.05)1, or 1.05, which equals $15,000. This means that $15,000 today is equivalent to $20,000 one year from now at 5% interest. If the interest rate is 10%, then the present value would be $14,286, which is calculated as $20,000 divided by (1 + 0.10)1, or 1.10."

If the government is currently paying 5% per year on savings bonds, how much will\nit cost you today to buy this savings bond?\nThe $1,000 face value of the bond is the future value, and the number of years n that Charlotte must wait to\nget this face value is 30 years. The interest rate r is 5.0% and is the discount rate for the savings bond. Applying\nthe present value equation, we calculate the current price of this savings bond as follows:\nSo, it would cost you $231.38 to purchase this 30-year, 5%, $1,000 face-valued bond.\nWhat we have done in the above example is reduce, or discount, the future value of the bond to arrive at a\nvalue expressed in today’s dollars. Effectively, this discounting process is the exact opposite of compounding\ninterest that we covered earlier in our discussion of future value.\nAn important concept to remember is that compounding is the process that takes a present valuation of\nmoney to some point in the future, while discounting takes a future value of money and equates it to present\ndollar value terms.\nCommon applications in which you might use the present value formula include determining how much\nmoney you would need to invest in an interest-bearing account today in order to finance a college education\nfor your oldest child and how much you would need to invest today to meet your retirement plans 30 years\nfrom now.\nTVM, Inflation, Compounding Interest, Investing, Opportunity Costs, and Risk\nThe time value of money (TVM) is a critical concept in understanding the value of money relative to the\namount of time it is held, saved, or invested. The TVM concept and its specific applications are frequently used\nby individuals and organizations that might wish to better understand the values of financial assets and to\nimprove investing and saving strategies, whether these are personal or within business environments.\nAs we have discussed, the key element behind the concept of TVM is that a given amount of money is worth\nmore today than that same amount of money will be at any point in the future. Again, this is because money\ncan be saved or invested in interest-bearing accounts or investments that will generate interest income over\ntime, thus resulting in increased savings and dollar values as time passes.\nInflation\nThe entire concept of TVM exists largely due to the presence of inflation. Inflation is defined as a general\nincrease in the prices of goods and services and/or a drop in the value of money and its purchasing power.\nThe purchasing power of the consumer dollar is a statistic tracked by the part of the US Bureau of Labor\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n215\nStatistics and is part of the consumer price index (CPI) data that is periodically published by that government\nagency. In a way, purchasing power can be viewed as a mirror image or exact opposite of inflation or increases\nin consumer prices, as measured by the CPI. Figure 7.18 demonstrates the decline in the purchasing power of\nthe consumer dollar over the 13-year period from 2007 to 2020.\nWith this in mind, we can work with the TVM formula and use it to help determine the present value of money\nyou have in hand today, as well as how this same amount of money may be valued at any specific point in the\nfuture and at any specific rate of interest.\nFigure 7.18 Historical Purchasing Power Decline as a Result of Inflation, 2007–2020 (data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\nThe Relationship between TVM and Inflation",

One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it\nis preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when\ninflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending\nmoney later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing\npower of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move\ninto the future.\nMost investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a\npayment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general\nprices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of\nnormal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value\nof financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\nmay be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than\ninflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.\nConversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\nas time goes by under such conditions.\nThe Impact of Inflation on TVM\nThe difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the\neffects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods\nand services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that\nincreasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services\navailable will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services. When more\nmoney is created and made available to the consuming public, the value of each unit of currency will diminish.\n216\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThis will then have the effect of incentivizing consumers to spend their money now, or in the very near future,\ninstead of saving cash for later use. Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to\nincreased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the\ncosts of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\nConsumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it\nnow, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a\ndecision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\ninflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in\ntimes when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing\npower erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\nnow in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through\ninterest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\nLower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed\nas the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on\nto sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money\nless expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and\nservices they may require.

In order to\ndetermine more practical real interest rates, the original nominal rate must be adjusted using an inflation\nrate, such as those that are calculated and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics within the consumer\nprice index (CPI).\nA concept referred to as the Fisher effect, named for economist Irving Fisher, describes the relationship\nbetween inflation and the nominal and real interest rates and is expressed using the following formula:\nwhere i is the nominal interest rate, R is the real interest rate, and h is the expected inflation rate.\nAn example of the Fisher effect would be seen in the case of a bond investor who is expecting a real interest\nrate of return of 6% on the bond, in an economy that is experiencing an expected inflation rate of 2%. Using\nthe above formula, we have\nSo, the nominal interest rate on the bond amounts to 8.12%, with a real interest rate of 6% within an economy\nthat is experiencing a 2% inflation rate. This is a logical result because in a scenario of positive inflation, a real\nrate of return would always be expected to amount to less than the stated or nominal rate.\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n217\nInterest and Savings\nSavings are adversely affected by negative real interest rates. A person who holds money in the form of cash is\nactually losing future purchasing value when real interest rates are negative. A saver who decides to hold\n$1,000 in the form of cash for one year at a negative real interest rate of −3.65% per year will lose\nor $36.50, in purchasing power by the end of that year.\nOrdinarily, interest rates would rise to compensate for negative real rates, but this might not happen if the\nFederal Reserve takes steps to maintain low interest rates to help stimulate and stabilize the economy. When\ninterest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury and money market investments due\nto their extremely poor returns.\nIt soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and\ndirect impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this",

A person who holds money in the form of cash is actually losing future purchasing value when real interest rates are negative. A saver who decides to hold $1,000 in the form of cash for one year at a negative real interest rate of −3.65% per year will lose $36.50, in purchasing power by the end of that year. Ordinarily, interest rates would rise to compensate for negative real rates, but this might not happen if the Federal Reserve takes steps to maintain low interest rates to help stimulate and stabilize the economy. When interest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury and money market investments due to their extremely poor returns. It soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and direct impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is therefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our savings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health. Compounding Interest As we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In cases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned interest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a savings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of five years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the original principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the total amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount. So, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in interest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610. Now, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this"

The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time\nto double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth\nrate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not\nas a percentage. So, as a result, we have\nThis formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for\nunderstanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary\nbalance.\nFollowing are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very\neasily, often enabling you to solve them “in your head,” without the need for a calculator or spreadsheet.\nLet’s say you are interested in knowing how long it will take your savings account balance to double. If your\naccount earns an interest rate of 9%, your money will take\nor 8, years to double. However, if you are\nearning only 6% on this same investment, your money will take\n, or 12, years to double.\nNow let’s say you have a specific future purchasing need and you know that you will need to double your\nmoney in five years. In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of\n, or 14.4%.\nThrough these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can\nhave significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\nTo further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s\ngross domestic product is growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n219\ntake the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\nNow, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in\n, or 36, years. However, if the rate of\ngrowth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in\n, or 6.55, years. By performing such\ncalculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\ngrowth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation\nand development.\nIt is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings\namounts that are earning interest.\nTo apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers\nwould lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in\n, or about 10.3,\nyears.\nIn an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of\n24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\nyou owe to the credit card company will double in only\n, or 3, years.\nSo, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage\npoint in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic\nforecasting models.\nIt is important to understand that the rule of 72 can be applied in any scenario where we have a quantity or an\namount that is in the process of growing or is expected to grow for any period of time into the future. A good\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in\nor\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only\n, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\nInvesting and Risk\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.",

For example, let’s consider the\ndecision to go to college after you graduate from high school. This decision, as with just about any other, will\ninvolve evaluating opportunity costs. If you choose to go to college, this will result in your sacrificing four years\nof potential earnings that you could have had if you had decided to take a job instead of attending school.\nAlso, in addition to the lost salary, you would be losing out on four years of work experience that could have\nhad a positive impact on your résumé or your future earnings prospects.\nOf course, the entire idea behind furthering one’s education is that you are hopeful that by choosing to go to\ncollege, you will increase the likelihood of earning a greater salary over the course of your lifetime than you\nwould have if you had chosen to join the workforce directly out of high school. So, this ends up being a bit of a\nrisk, but one that you have considered. The idea is that you are hoping for a more significant payoff down the\nroad than if you had made the decision not to continue with your studies. When it comes to opportunity costs\nand the time value of money, it is obvious that there will always be costs associated with every forgone\nfinancial opportunity we pass on when we make a different choice. The logical individual can only hope that\nthese choices produce a better end result than if we had made different choices and pursued any of our\nforgone alternatives. This also applies in situations where we may sit idly by and decide to take no action at all.\nFor example, if you are putting $1,000 in a savings account to save for a house, you may be giving up an\nopportunity to grow that money in an investment account that would earn a greater rate of return. In another\nexample, being able to calculate the future value of your money will tell you that instead of investing, you\nprobably should be paying down your 24% APR credit card debt that is costing you hundreds of dollars a\nmonth—hundreds of dollars more than you might earn from an investment account.\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n221\nSummary\n7.1 Now versus Later Concepts\nThis section discussed the underlying concepts of the time value of money (TVM). Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth.

Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%\ndividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out\n$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of\ncontinuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in\nperpetuity.\nTo place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one\nshare of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that\none share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But\nbe careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but the required rate of return, the “market\nrate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk. We must also note an important fact affecting all\n228\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninvestment valuations: the value of an investment generally represents our expectations of all future cash\nflows from that investment, discounted to today’s dollars.\nBecause a perpetuity is a stream of payments continuing indefinitely, determining the future value isn’t\npossible. Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity? Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\nBy substitution,\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend\nof $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what\nprice should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is\n, or $30.17.",

Present or future values\nof these streams of payments can be calculated by applying time value of money formulas to each of these\npayments. We’ll begin with determining the present value.\nBefore exploring present value, it’s helpful to analyze the behavior of a stream of payments over time. Assume\nthat we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at the end of each year for five years, earning 7%\ncompounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\ninterest from past periods.\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we",

If you can earn a 5% annual rate of interest, how much will you have if you\nbegin at age 20? What if you delay this program until age 30? The additional 10 years can make a\nsurprisingly large difference. How can you calculate that difference?\nSolution:\nPerform two separate calculations comparable to the chapter examples above, using the formula for the\nfuture value of an ordinary annuity. You plan to make the first investment immediately, making this an\nannuity due, so you will multiply by one additional period, (1 + 0.05). Notice that the only difference\nbetween the two calculations is the exponent N, representing the number of periods.\nThirty years (starting at age 30):\nForty years (starting at age 20):\nWaiting 10 years before committing to this program comes with a surprisingly high cost—a loss of almost\n82% of the potential value.\nHow Annuities Are Used for Retirement Planning\nOn a final note, how might annuities be used for retirement planning? A person might receive a lump-sum\nwindfall from an investment, and rather than choosing to accept the proceeds, they might decide to invest the\nsum (ignoring taxes) in an annuity. Their intention is to let this invested sum produce annual distributions to\nsupplement Social Security payments. Assume the recipient just received $75,000, again ignoring tax effects.\nThey have the chance to invest in an annuity that will provide a distribution at the end of each of the next five\nyears, and that annuity contract provides interest at 3% annually. Their first receipt will be one year from now.\nThis is an ordinary annuity.\nWe can also solve for the payment given the other variables, an important aspect of financial analysis. If the\nperson with the $75,000 windfall wants this fund to last five years and they can earn 3%, then how much can\nthey withdraw from this fund each year? To solve this question, we can apply the present value of an annuity\nformula. This time, the payment (PYMT) is the unknown, and we know that the PVa, or the present value that\nthey have at this moment, is $75,000:\n238\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe person can withdraw this amount every year beginning one year from now, and when the final payment is\nwithdrawn, the fund will be depleted. Interest accrues each year on the beginning balance, and then\n$16,376.60 is withdrawn at the end of each year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAnother View of Annuities\nMany examples of annuities are available, with presentations as varied as the opinions as to how\nappropriate they are for investors, especially retirees. Math Is Fun (https://openstax.org/r/Math_Is_Fun) is\nparticularly interesting and potentially helpful for understanding how to apply this knowledge.\n8.3\nLoan Amortization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between different types of loans.\n•\nExplain how amortization works.\n•\nCreate an amortization schedule.\n•\nCalculate the cost of borrowing.\nTypes of Loans\nFunds can be loaned to businesses of any type, including corporations, partnerships, limited liability\ncompanies, and proprietorships. Bankers often refer to these lending structures as facilities, and they can be\ntailored to the specific needs of the borrower in a number of ways. Similarly, lenders develop loans and lines of\ncredit for individuals. Whether for a business or an individual, the purpose of the loan, method of repayment,\ninterest rate, specific terms, and time involved must all be tailored to the goals of the borrower and the lender.\nIn this chapter, we will focus on fixed-rate loans, although other alternatives exist.\nTypical business loans include the following:\n•\nTerm loans generally bear a maturity date and a set rate of interest and are typically used to finance\ninvestments in assets such as equipment, buildings, and possibly other acquired firms. The length of the\nterm loan is generally designed to match the useful life of the asset being financed, and it will usually be\nrepaid on a monthly schedule. It’s common for a term loan to be backed by collateral, such as the asset\nitself or other assets of the business.\n•\nRevolving lines of credit (revolvers), are used to finance the short-term working capital needs of a\nbusiness. Revolvers will have a specific maximum but no set schedule of monthly payments. Interest\naccrues on the amount of cash that a company has drawn down from the facility. These credit lines may\nbe secured by accounts receivable, inventory, other assets of the business, or sometimes simply the good\n8.3 • Loan Amortization\n239\nfaith and credit of the company if the firm is strong, creditworthy, and established with the lender.",

We added a line for totals.\nThis is now a complete loan amortization schedule (see Figure 8.13). The first several periods display, followed\nby the last few periods, to prove that the schedule is complete (data rows for month 4 to month 22 are\nhidden).\nFigure 8.13 Completed Amortization Schedule\nThis will look familiar; it’s the same amortization table used as a proof in Section 8.3 (see Table 8.4).

In all cases, the payments in the stream were\nidentical. If they had not been identical, a separate set of operators would be required, and these will be\naddressed in the next chapter.\n256\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n8.1 Perpetuities\nA perpetuity is an investment that is intended to provide an expected return indefinitely, either remaining\nconstant or growing by an incremental amount. Preferred stock is a common example with a preestablished\ndividend formula. An indefinite stream of payments cannot be compounded into a future value, but it can be\ndiscounted to a present value, providing an opportunity to determine the amount an investor should be\nwilling to pay for a share of that stock.\n8.2 Annuities\nAn annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments that is expected to be paid or received. Calculations of future\nvalue or present value are commonly performed on these payment streams for a wide number of reasons in\nbusiness and personal financial analysis, as seen in the chapter focusing on single amounts, particularly in\nloan repayment. Annuities may be ordinary annuities, in which the first cash flow of a series occurs at the end\nof the first period, or annuities due, if the first cash flow occurs at the beginning point of the first period.\n8.3 Loan Amortization\nLoans are contracts between a lender and a borrower. Failure to observe the rules of that contract, such as\npayment of interest or repayment of the amount owed, can subject the borrower to substantial penalties as\nwell as damage to their credit. Loan agreements bearing a fixed rate of interest have a scheduled\namortization, or rate and time of repayments with interest. Several types of business and personal loans were\ndescribed.\n8.4 Stated versus Effective Rates\nFor a borrower to understand the true cost of financing, they must be familiar with interannual compounding,\nwhich can cause a stated interest rate that appears to be annual to actually be higher. The effective rate of\ninterest was demonstrated to understand that true cost.\n8.5 Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\nThe use of two tools for managing and understanding the time value of money and its many applications was\ndiscussed: a professional financial calculator and the popular Microsoft Office Suite spreadsheet application\nExcel.\nKey Terms\nannuity\na stream of regular, periodic payments to be received or paid\nannuity due\na stream of periodic payments in which the payment or receipt occurs at the beginning of each\nperiod\nconstant perpetuity\na stream of periodic payments that is expected to continue indefinitely with no change\nin the amount paid or received\ndiscount rate\nan interest rate used in time value of money calculations to determine present value; may\nderive from several sources, such as stated contract rates, costs to borrow, or expected rates of return on\ninvestments\neffective interest rate\nthe interest rate that results when compounding occurs multiple times within a year;\nthe true cost of borrowing\ngrowing perpetuity\na stream of periodic payments that is expected to continue indefinitely with growth of",

This includes the $27,000 that you\ninvested plus $8,062.26 in interest earned by compounding.\nIt’s important to note that throughout these sections on the time value of money and compounded or\ndiscounted values of mixed streams and their analysis, we are placing the valuation at the end or beginning of\na period for simplicity in the examples. In reality, businesses might consider valuations happening within the\nperiod to allow for a degree of regularity in the revenue streams provided by the asset being considered.\nHowever, because this is a technique of forecasting, which is inherently uncertain, we will continue with\nanalysis by period.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFuture Value of a Mixed Stream\nAssume that you can invest five annual payments of $10,000, beginning immediately, but you believe you\nwill be able to invest additional amounts of $5,000 at the beginning of years 4 and 5. This investment is\nexpected to earn 4% each year. What is the anticipated future value of this investment after the full five\nyears?\nSolution:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nCash Invested\n$0.00\n$10,000\n$10,000\n$10,000\n$15,000\n$15,000\nCumulative Cash Flows\n$10,000\n$20,000\n$30,000\n$45,000\n$60,000\nYears to Compound\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nCompounded Value at End of Year 5\n$12,166.53 $11,698.59 $11,248.64 $16,224.00 $15,600.00\nTable 9.4\nThe equations to calculate each individual year’s compounded value at the end of the five years are as\nfollows:\nThe sum of these individual calculations is $66,937.76, which is the total value of this stream of invested\namounts plus compounded interest.\n266\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLet’s take the example above and review it from a different angle. Keeping in mind that we have not yet\nexplored the use of Excel, is there another way to view our solution? The problem above takes each annual\ninvestment and compounds it into the future, then adds the results of each calculation to find the total future\nvalue of the stream of payments.\nBut when you break the problem down, another way to look at the problem is as a five-year annuity of $10,000\nper year plus added payments in years 4 and 5. Can we solve for the future value of an annuity first and then\nperform two separate calculations on the additional amounts ($5,000 each in years 4 and 5)? Yes, we can.\nLet’s summarize:\n•\nFuture value of a $10,000 annuity due, 4%, 5 years, plus\n•\nFuture value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 2 years, plus\n•\nFuture value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 1 year\nThis must give us the same result. The formula for the future value of an annuity due is\nThis problem can be solved in the three steps of the summary above.\nStep 1:\nStep 2:\nStep 3:\nCombining the results from each of the three steps gives us\nIt works. Whether you view this problem as five separate periods that can be compounded separately and\nthen combined or as a combination of one or more annuities and/or single payment problems, we always\narrive at the same solution if we are diligent about the time, the interest, and the stream of payments.\nThe Present Value of a Mixed Stream\nNow that we’ve seen the calculation of a future value, consider a present value. We will begin with a\npersonal example. You win a cash windfall through your state’s lottery. You would like to take a portion of the\nfunds and place them in a fixed investment so that you can draw $17,000 per year starting one year from now\nand continue to do so for the next two years. At the end of year 4, you want to withdraw $17,500, and at the\nend of year 5, you will withdraw the last $18,000 to close the account. When you take your last payment of",

Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.\nWe closed this excellent interview with agreement that we were “kindred spirits” regarding the importance\nof cash flow analysis, including capital decisions such as those mentioned in this chapter.

The final column gives the bond rating, a grade that indicates credit quality. As we\nprogress through this chapter, we will examine prices, coupon rates, yields, and bond ratings in more\ndetail\nTypes of Bonds\nThere are three primary categories of bonds, though the specifics of these different types of bond can vary\ndepending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest rate, and risk.\nGovernment Bonds\nThe safest category of bonds are short-term US Treasury bills (T-bills). These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGovernment Bonds\nReview this introductory video (https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices) about government bonds.\nMunicipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors. Though the global fixed-income debt\nmarket remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond\nmarkets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some\nexperts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only\n(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.\nThe chart in Figure 10.2 provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own\nconclusions about these markets.\nFigure 10.2 Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020 (data source: Nasdaq)\nWhile the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past\nseveral years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.",

The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the\ninterest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s\nfuture cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.\nAs we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the\ncurrent price if the investor holds the bond to maturity.\nYield to Maturity\nAs noted above, the market sets this discount rate, or the yield to maturity. The YTM reflects the going rate in\nthe bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.\nHence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market\ndetermines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other\navailable financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and\ndefault specific to the issued bond.\nThe YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity.

We will discuss bond default and default risk next.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Yield Curve\nReview this video (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-the-yield-curve) that introduces the concept of\nthe yield curve.\n10.3 • Using the Yield Curve\n297\nDifferent Shapes of the Yield Curve\nThere are two important elements to any yield curve that will define its shape: its level and its slope. The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-\nincome investments, such as the purchase of bond issues. Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a\nnegative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but\nthe curve inverted in March 2019 as yields on short-term bonds exceeded those of longer-term bonds,\nresulting in concerns surrounding impending recession and other economic problems.

            "chunk": "Generating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they\nwould earn by only investing in short-term bonds. Also, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced\nby the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making the bond ladder less risky than an investment\nthat only included long-term bonds.\nIt is easy to see why bond laddering has become such a highly adopted bond investment strategy with\ninvestors ranging from novice to the most well-seasoned and experienced.\nInterest Rate Movements and Bond Prices\nWe now know that when investors buy bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are lending money\nto bond-issuing firms or governments. In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated\ncoupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.\nWe have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest\nrates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDemonstrate bond valuations using Excel.\n•\nDemonstrate bond yield calculations using Excel.\nCalculating the Price (Present Value) of a Bond\nThe following examples illustrate how Microsoft Excel can be used to calculate common bond problems.\nPlease be sure to refer to the chapters on the time value of money for examples of using spreadsheets to solve\npresent value problems, as these same concepts are also used in solving bond problems.\nYou can use the following steps in Excel to determine the price or present value of a coupon bond.

Assume that you\nare considering investing in a bond that is selling for $820.00, has a face value of $1,000, and has an annual\ncoupon rate of 3%. If the YTM is 10%, how long will it be until the bond matures?\n1.\nFirst, select Formulas from the Excel upper menu bar, and from the dialog box, select Nper (see Figure\n10.18).\nFigure 10.18 Using Excel to Calculate Bond Time to Maturity\n310\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n2.",

These are excellent introductory videos\nthat will provide you with helpful information on what these ratios represent and how they can be used in\nstock valuation.\n322\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAlternative Multipliers\nThere are two main types of valuation metrics multiples used to value common stock. These are equity\nmultiples and enterprise value (EV) multiples. Additionally, there are two primary methods by which to\nperform analysis using these multiples. These methods are comparable company analysis (comps) and\nprecedent transaction analysis (precedents).\nExperienced financial analysts advocate the use of multiples in valuation analysis for a number of reasons, the\nmost important being that they help generate realistic and sound judgments of enterprise values (total\ncompany values), they are relatively easy to use and interpret, and they can provide helpful information on a\ncompany’s overall financial condition when used appropriately.\nHowever, it should be noted that simplicity may have some important disadvantages. When such complex\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses. The P/CF ratio is helpful for arriving at a less\ndistorted view of such a company’s value.\nWhile these various metrics are important, a financial analyst must always consider that companies often\noperate under their own unique sets of circumstances that ultimately will influence many of these equity\nmultiples.\nEnterprise Value (EV) Multiples\nThe following are some common EV multiples used in valuation analyses:\nGordon growth model is as follows\n11.1 • Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\n323\nEV multiples take an increasingly important role when value decisions surround recent mergers and\nacquisitions. Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their",

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. Examples of such companies include Facebook, Amazon,\nGoogle, Biogen, and Monster Beverage. The DCF model differs from the dividend discount models we covered\nearlier, as DDM methodologies are almost entirely based on a stock’s periodic dividends.\nThe DCF model is an absolute valuation model, meaning that it does not involve comparisons with other firms\nwithin any specific industry but instead uses objective data to evaluate a company on a stand-alone basis. The\nDCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows, determining the present value of the entire organization and\nthen working this down to the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\nThis highly regarded methodology is the evaluation tool of choice for experienced financial analysts when\nevaluating companies and their common stock. Many analysts prefer DCF methods of valuation because these\nare based on a company’s cash flows, which are far less easily manipulated through accounting treatments\nthan revenues or bottom-line earnings.\nThe DCF model formula in its mathematical form is presented below:\nwhere CF1 is the estimated cash flow in year 1, CF2 is the estimated cash flow in year 2, and so on; TCF is the\nterminal cash flow, or expected cash flow from the ending asset sale; r is the discount rate or required rate of\nreturn; g is the anticipated growth rate of the cash flow; and n is the number of years covered in the model.\nApplying the DCF Model\nWe can apply the DCF model to an example to demonstrate this methodology and how the formula works.\nCalculate the value of Mayweather Inc. and its common stock based on the next six years of cash flow results.\nAssume that the discount rate (required rate of return) is 8%, Mayweather’s growth rate is 3%, and the\nterminal value (TCF) will be two and one-half times the discounted value of the cash flow in year 6.\n11.3 • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\n341\nMayweather has a cash flow of $2.0 million in year 1, so its discounted cash flow after one year (CF1) is\n$1,851,851.85. We arrive at this amount by applying the discount rate of 8% for a one-year period to determine\nthe present value.\nIn subsequent years, Mayweather’s cash flow will be increasing by 3%. These future cash flows also must be\ndiscounted back to present values at an 8% rate, so the discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years\nwill be as follows:\nOur earlier assumption that the terminal value will be 2.5 times the value in the sixth year gives us a total\nterminal cash flow (TCF) of\n, or $3,652,697. Now, if we take all these future discounted cash\nflows and add them together, we arrive at a grand total of $13,554,477. So, based on our DCF model analysis,\nthe total value of Mayweather Inc. is just over $13.5 million.\nAt this point, we have the estimated value of the entire company, but we need to work this down to the level of\nper-share value of common stock.\nLet’s say that Mayweather is currently trading at $12 per share, and it has 1,000,000 common shares\noutstanding. This tells us that the market capitalization of the company is\n, or $12 million,\nand that a $12 share price may be considered relatively low. The reason for this is that based on our DCF",

It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant\ncash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of\nperpetuity.\nIt is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another\nform of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred\nstock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.\nDetermining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock\nWe can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the\nfollowing example. Oh-Well Heath Services Inc. has issued preferred stock that has a par value of $1,000 and\npays an annual dividend rate of 5%.

In other\nwords, we want to know whether markets are efficient. By efficient markets, we mean markets in which costs\nare minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. To answer our questions, we will look at two forms of\nefficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency.\nOperational Efficiency\nOperational efficiency concerns the speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available\nprice.

SuperDOT was replaced by a system known as the Super Display Book (SDBK) in 2009 and\nsubsequently replaced by the Universal Trading Platform in 2012.\nNASDAQ used a process referred to as the small-order execution system (SOES) to process orders. The\npractice for registered dealers had been for SOES to publicly display all limit orders (orders awaiting execution\nat specified price), the best dealer quotes, and the best customer limit order sizes. The SOES system has now\nbeen largely phased out with the emergence of all-electronic trading that increased transaction speed at ever\nhigher trading volumes.\nPublic access to the best available prices promotes operational efficiency. This speed in matching buyers and\nsellers at the best available price is strong evidence that the stock markets are operationally efficient.\nInformational Efficiency\nA second measure of efficiency is informational efficiency, or how quickly a source reflects comprehensive\ninformation in the available trading prices. A price is efficient if the market has used all available information\nto set it, which implies that stocks always trade at their fair value (see Figure 11.12). If an investor does not\nreceive the most current information, the prices are “stale”; therefore, they are at a trading disadvantage.\nFigure 11.12 Forms of Market Efficiency A market is efficient if it provides all information that is available.\nForms of Market Efficiency\nFinancial economists have devised three forms of market efficiency from an information perspective: weak\nform, semi-strong form, and strong form. These three forms constitute the efficient market hypothesis.\nBelievers in these three forms of efficient markets maintain, in varying degrees, that it is pointless to search\nfor undervalued stocks, sell stocks at inflated prices, or predict market trends.\nIn weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock’s price history and trading volume. It is useless\nto chart historical stock prices to predict future stock prices such that you can identify mispriced stocks and\nroutinely outperform the market. In other words, technical analysis cannot beat the market. The market itself\nis the best technical analyst out there.\n346\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n11.1 Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\nThis section introduced common stock and some of the models and calculation methods used by investors\nand financial analysts to determine the prices or values of common shares. The most evaluative ratios that can\nbe computed from a company’s financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to book (P/B),\nprice-to-sales (P/S), and price-to cash-flow (P/CF) ratios.\n11.2 Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\nThe dividend discount model, or DDM, is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is\nthe present value of all of its future dividends. The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\n11.4 Preferred Stock",

            "chunk": "weeks. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\n354\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-\nexempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid\nsecurities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable. MMMFs provide smaller firms and investors the\nopportunity to participate in the money market by facilitating smaller individual investment amounts.\nFinancial Instrument Typical Maturity Minimum Amount\nIssuer\nTreasury bills\n4–52 weeks\n$10,000\nFederal government\nCommercial paper\n270 days\n$100,000\nBusinesses\nNegotiable CDs\n6 months\n$100,000\nFinancial institutions\nMMMFs\nInvestment companies\nFederal funds\n1 day\n$1 million\nFinancial institutions\nTable 12.1 Money Market Instrument Characteristics (Selected)\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets the equilibrium interest rate\non federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools.

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. Financial institutions such as banks are required to keep a\nfraction of their deposits on reserve with the Fed. When banks find they are short of reserves and immediately\nneed cash to meet reserve requirements, they can borrow directly from the Fed through the so-called\n“discount window” or purchase excess reserves from other banks in the federal funds market. Often, the\nmaturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market\nnegotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate\nrange in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market.\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the activities and functioning of the federal funds market has changed. The\nfederal funds rate is still the rate targeted by the Fed for monetary policy, but the participants have evolved for\nseveral reasons. The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the\nFederal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not\nrequired to keep reserves with the Fed. In addition, the Fed now pays interest to commercial banks for\nreserves held at the Federal Reserve banks. Paying interest on reserves reduces the incentive for domestic\ncommercial banks to enter the federal funds market since they can already earn interest on their excess\nreserves.\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n355\nDaily trading volume in the federal funds market from 2016 through 2020 ranged from a high of $115 billion in\nMarch of 2018 to a low of only $34 billion on December 31, 2020.2 The volume of federal funds activity is lower\nin periods of slower economic growth because banks have fewer good opportunities to issue loans and are\nless likely to be short of required reserves.\nBond Markets\nBond markets are financial markets that make payments to investors for a specific period of time. Investors\ndecide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expect inflation to affect the value of the\nfixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\nGovernment Bond Markets\nIn the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities\nin the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.\nWe learned in Bonds and Bond Valuation that the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to\nraise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,\nas the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.\nThe debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online at https://www.usdebtclock.org/\n(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).\nTreasury notes (T-notes) are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The\nTreasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov\n(https://openstax.org/r/treasurydirect.gov) in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in\nthat they are longer term and pay semiannual coupon interest payments, as well as the par or face value of\nthe note at maturity. T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\nexplicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and",

For corporations, shares of stock\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the\ncash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.\nCorporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise\ncapital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners. There are generally\ntwo types of stock, preferred and common. Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and bonds.\nPreferred stock has a higher claim to cash flows than common stockholders have (thus the term preferred),\nbut it is lower than that of bondholders. In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of\nthe three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.\nCommon stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a\nclaim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have\nvoting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.\nOne popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or\nmarket cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The largest company by sales\nvolume in 2020 was Walmart.7\nGeographical Location of Exchanges\nOwnership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in an over-\nthe-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly\nadapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a\nbroker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors\nare always able to buy or sell their stocks. An OTC market is an electronic market conducted on computer\nscreens and consists of direct transactions among buyers and sellers, with no broker to bring the two\n6\nSiblis Research. “Total Market Value of US Stock Market.” Siblis Research. https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/;\nThe World Bank. “Market Capitalization of Listed Domestic Companies (current US$).” The World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/\nindicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD\n7\nCompanies Market Cap. “Largest American Companies by Market Capitalization.” Companies Market Cap.\nhttps://companiesmarketcap.com/usa/largest-companies-in-the-usa-by-market-cap/; National Retail Federation. “Top 100 Retailers\n2020 List.” National Retail Federation. 2020. https://nrf.com/resources/top-retailers/top-100-retailers/top-100-retailers-2020-list\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n359\ntogether.

When issuing new equity, the issuing firm receives the proceeds of the sale. Having an active\nsecondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired.\nMost of the trading of equity securities is for used securities on the secondary market.\nAn initial public offering, or IPO, occurs when a firm offers stock to the public for the first time. With a typical\nIPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The\ninvestment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue,\nand establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see\nFigure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of\nthe value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum\ncompany, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.8 The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at\nover $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese\ngovernment.9\nInstitutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Smaller investors\nrarely have the opportunity to purchase. However, any investor can buy the new shares once available for\npublic trading. Investment author and financial expert Professor Burton Malkiel cautions that buying IPOs\nimmediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs\nhave underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.10\nAnother way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through a seasoned equity offering\n(SEO). An IPO occurs when a firm transitions from a private to a public company. An SEO takes place when a\ncorporation that is already publicly traded issues additional shares of stock to the public. An SEO is often part\nof a SEC Rule 415 offering, or so-called shelf registration. Shelf registrations allow a company to register with\nthe SEC to issue new shares but wait up to two years before issuing the shares. This gives companies the\nability to register their intent to issue new shares and to “set them on the shelf” until market conditions are\nmost favorable for issuance to the public.\n8\nJennifer Rudden. “Largest IPOs Worldwide as of January 21, 2021.” Statista. 2021. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269343/\nworlds-largest-ipos/\n9\nDeborah D’Souza. “Ant Group Set to Be World’s Largest IPO Ever.” Investopedia.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and",

Both indices\ntrack the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation. A lower standard deviation of returns suggests less uncertainty of\nreturns and therefore less risk.\nCapital market history demonstrates that the average return to stocks has significantly outperformed other\nfinancial security classes, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or the money market. Table 12.4\nprovides the return and standard deviation of several US investment classes over the 40-year period\n1981–2020. As you can see, stocks outperformed bonds, bills, and inflation.

Note that the value of the\nlarge company portfolio is more than 50 times greater than the equal investment in long-term US government\nbonds. This supports the importance of thoughtful asset allocation.\nStill, the size of a firm has a significant impact on how investors choose equity securities. Capital market\nhistory also shows that a portfolio of small company stocks has realized larger average annual returns, as well\nas greater variability, than a portfolio of large companies as represented by the S&P 500.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If",

However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\nfor arithmetic mean.\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\nthen divide by the number of data values.\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data. Population\ndata represents all the outcomes or measurements that are of interest. Sample data represents outcomes or\nmeasurements collected from a subset, or part, of the population of interest.\nThe notation\nis used to indicate the sample mean, where the arithmetic mean is calculated based on data\ntaken from a sample. The notation\nis used to denote the sum of the data values, and\nis used to indicate\nthe number of data values in the sample, also known as the sample size.\nThe sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:\nFinance professionals often rely on averages of Treasury bill auction amounts to determine their value. Table\n13.1 lists the Treasury bill auction amounts for a sample of auctions from December 2020.\nMaturity\nAmount ($Billions)\n4-week T-bills\n$32.9\n8-week T-bills\n38.4\n13-week T-bills\n63.1\n26-week T-bills\n59.6\n52-week T-bills\n39.7\nTotal\n$233.7\nTable 13.1 United States Treasury Bill\nAuctions, December 22 and 24, 2020\n(source: Treasury Direct)\n382\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean of the amount paid for Treasury bills at auction, in billions of dollars, we use\nthe following formula:\nMedian\nTo determine the median of a data set, order the data from smallest to largest, and then find the middle value\nin the ordered data set. For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\nSolution:\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\n$5,000,000.\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\nset.\n13.1 • Measures of Center\n383\nMode\nAnother measure of center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one\nmode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data\nset with two modes is called bimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology\nstock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:\nTo find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this\ndata set is 72. It is helpful to know that the most common closing price of this particular stock over the past 20\nweeks has been $72.00.\nGeometric Mean",

They are\nall, in their own way, trying to measure the common point within the data—that which is “normal.” In the case\nof the arithmetic mean, this is accomplished by finding the value from which all points are equal linear\ndistances. We can imagine that all the data values are combined through addition and then distributed back to\neach data point in equal amounts.\nThe geometric mean redistributes not the sum of the values but their product. It is calculated by multiplying\nall the individual values and then redistributing them in equal portions such that the total product remains the\nsame. This can be seen from the formula for the geometric mean, x̃ (pronounced x-tilde):\nThe geometric mean is relevant in economics and finance for dealing with growth—of markets, in investments,\nand so on.

The investor may want to quantify\nthis variation in order to make the best investment decisions for a particular investment objective.\nThe most common measure of variation, or spread, is standard deviation.

It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\nvariation.\nSuppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B.

Figure 13.2 shows the mean and standard deviation for the 10 ages.\nFigure 13.2 Mean and Standard Deviation in Excel.\nRelationship between Standard Deviation and Variance\nIn the formulas shown above for variance and standard deviation, notice that the variance is the square of the\nstandard deviation, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nOnce you have calculated one of these values, you can directly calculate the other value. For example, if you\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.\nIn the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by\ncalculating the square root of the variance. For example, if the variance of a data set is known to be 31.36, then\nthe standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of 31.36, which is 5.6.\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n389\nOne disadvantage of using the variance is that the variance is measured in square units, which are different\nfrom the units in the data set. For example, if the data set consists of ages measured in years, then the\nvariance would be measured in years squared, which can be confusing. The standard deviation is measured in\nthe same units as the original data set, and thus the standard deviation is used more commonly than the\nvariance to measure the spread of a data set.\n13.3\nMeasures of Position\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate z-scores for a measurement.\n•\nDefine and calculate quartiles and percentiles for a data set.\n•\nUse quartiles as a method to detect outliers in a data set.\nz-Scores\nA z-score, also called a z-value, is a measure of the position of an entry in a data set. It represents the number\nof standard deviations by which a data value differs from the mean. For example, suppose that in a certain\nyear, the rates of return for various technology-focused mutual funds are examined, and the mean return is\n7.8% with a standard deviation of 2.3%. A certain mutual fund publishes its rate of return as 12.4%. Based on\nthis rate of return of 12.4%, we can calculate the relative standing of this mutual fund compared to the other\ntechnology-focused mutual funds. The corresponding z-score of a measurement considers the given\nmeasurement in relation to the mean and standard deviation for the entire population.\nThe formula for a z-score calculation is as follows:\nwhere x is the measurement,\nis the mean, and\nis the standard deviation.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nInterpreting a z-Score\nA certain technology-based mutual fund reports a rate of return of 12.4% for a certain year, while the mean\nrate of return for comparable funds is 7.8% and the standard deviation is 2.3%. Calculate and interpret the\nz-score for this particular mutual fund.\nSolution:\nIn this example, the measurement\nand\nUsing the z-score formula, the\ncalculation is performed as follows:\nThe resulting z-score indicates the number of standard deviations by which a particular measurement is\nabove or below the mean. In this example, the rate of return for this particular mutual fund is 2 standard\ndeviations above the mean, indicating that this mutual fund generated a significantly better rate of return\nthan all other technology-based mutual funds for the same time period.\nQuartiles and Percentiles\nIf a person takes an IQ test, their resulting score might be reported as in the 87th percentile. This percentile\nindicates the person’s relative performance compared to others taking the IQ test. A person scoring in the\n87th percentile has an IQ score higher than 87% of all others taking the test. This is the same as saying that the\n390\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nperson is in the top 13% of all people taking the IQ test.\nCommon measures of location are quartiles and percentiles. Quartiles are special percentiles. The first\nquartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile, Q3, is the same as the 75th percentile.\nThe median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th percentile.\nTo calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide\nordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. If you score in the 90th percentile\nof an exam, that does not necessarily mean that you receive 90% on the test. It means that 90% of the test\nscores are the same as or less than your score and the remaining 10% of the scores are the same as or greater\nthan your score.\nPercentiles are useful for comparing values. In a finance example, a mutual fund might report that the\nperformance for the fund over the past year was in the 80th percentile of all mutual funds in the peer group.\nThis indicates that the fund performed better than 80% of all other funds in the peer group.

It is available as a free program and\nprovides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical programming. R is\nincreasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical tool as it is an open-source language and additional\nfeatures are constantly being added by the user community. The tool can be used on many different\ncomputing platforms and can be downloaded at the R Project website (https://openstax.org/r/the-R-project-\nwebsite).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUsing the R Statistical Tool\nThere are many resources for learning and using the R statistical tool, including the following:\nHow to install R on different computer operating systems (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-install)\nIntroduction to using R (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-using-R)\nHow to import and export data using R (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-import-and-export)\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) on using R (https://openstax.org/r/frequently-asked-questions)\nOnce you have installed and started R on your computer, at the bottom of the R console, you should see the\nsymbol >, which indicates that R is ready to accept commands.\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or 'help.start()' for an HTML\nbrowser interface to help. Type 'q()' to quit R.\n>\nR is a command-driven language, meaning that the user enters commands at the prompt, which R then\nexecutes one at a time. R can also execute a program containing multiple commands. There are ways to add a\ngraphic user interface (GUI) to R. An example of a GUI tool for R is RStudio (https://openstax.org/r/RStudio).\nThe R command line can be used to perform any numeric calculation, similar to a handheld calculator.

For statistical analysis, there are many preestablished\nfunctions in R to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and so on. Variables can be named and\nassigned values using the assignment operator <-. For example, the following R commands assign the value of\n20 to the variable named x and assign the value of 30 to the variable named y:\n> x <- 20\n> y <- 30\nThese variable names can be used in any calculation, such as multiplying x by y to produce the result 600:\n> x*y\n[1] 600\nThe typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector. The following R command will generate a vector called salaries that contains the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nThis vector salaries can then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as\nshown:\n> mean(salaries)\n[1] 64250\n> median(salaries)\n[1] 62500\n> min(salaries)\n[1] 40000\n> max(salaries)\n[1] 92000\n13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool\n407\nAnother option for generating a vector in R is to use the seq function, which will automatically generate a\nsequence of numbers.

The\nterms mean and average are often used interchangeably. To calculate the mean for a set of numbers, add the\nnumbers together and then divide the sum by the number of data values. The geometric mean redistributes\nnot the sum of the values but the product by multiplying all of the individual values and then redistributing\nthem in equal portions such that the total product remains the same. To calculate the median for a set of\nnumbers, order the data from smallest to largest and identify the middle data value in the ordered data set.\n13.2 Measures of Spread\nThe standard deviation and variance are measures of the spread of a data set. The standard deviation is small\nwhen the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard\ndeviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. The\nformula used to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the data represents a sample or a\npopulation, as the formulas for the sample standard deviation and the population standard deviation are\nslightly different.\n13.3 Measures of Position\nSeveral measures are used to indicate the position of a data value in a data set. One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,\nQ3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles\ndivide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.\n13.4 Statistical Distributions\nA frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to\norganize and tabulate the data in a summarized way. Once a frequency distribution is generated, it can be\nused to create graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set. The normal distribution has two\nparameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,\n, and the standard deviation,\n. The exponential\ndistribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.\n13.5 Probability Distributions\nA probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. In many\nfinancial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. When analyzing distributions that\nfollow a normal distribution, probabilities can be calculated by finding the area under the graph of the normal\ncurve.\n13.6 Data Visualization and Graphical Displays\nData visualization refers to the use of graphical displays to summarize a data set to help to interpret patterns\nand trends in the data. Univariate data refers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute,\nsuch as salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\nseveral types of graphs. The type of graph to be used for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the\ndata and the purpose of the graph. Examples of graphs for univariate data include line graphs, bar graphs,\nand histograms. Bivariate data refers to paired data where each value of one variable is paired with a value of\na second variable. Examples of graphs for bivariate data include time series graphs and scatter plots.\n13 • Summary\n411\n13.7 The R Statistical Analysis Tool\nR is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry.

For example, we may be interested\nto know if there is a correlation between bond prices and interest rates or between the age of a car and the\nvalue of the car. To investigate the correlation between two numeric quantities, the first step is to create a\nscatter plot that will graph the (x, y) ordered pairs. The independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the\nx-variable, and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as the y-variable.\nFor example, we may be interested to know if the price of Nike stock is correlated with the value of the S&P 500\n(Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index). To investigate this, monthly data can be collected for Nike stock\nprices and value of the S&P 500 for a period of time, and a scatter plot can be created and examined. A scatter\nplot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two variables. The\nsetup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted\non the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted\non the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter\ndiagram. Table 14.1 shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year\ntime period.\nTo assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine\nif a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a\nnegative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent\nvariable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to\ndecrease (the two quantities move in the same direction). A negative correlation indicates that as the\nindependent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases, or, as the independent variable decreases,\nthe dependent variable increases (the two quantities move in opposite directions). If there is no relationship or\nassociation between the two quantities, where one quantity changing does not affect the other quantity, we\nconclude that there is no correlation between the two variables.\nDate\nS&P 500\nNike\nStock Price\n4/1/2020 2,912.43\n87.18\n5/1/2020 3,044.31\n98.58\n6/1/2020 3,100.29\n98.05\nTable 14.1 Nike Stock Price ($) and\nValue of S&P 500 over a One-Year\nTime Period (source: Yahoo!

We must remember that correlation\ndoes not imply causation.\nTest a Correlation Coefficient for Significance\nThe correlation coefficient, r, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between x and\ny. The sample data are used to compute r, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the\nentire population (that is, all measurements of interest), we could find the population correlation coefficient,\nwhich is labeled as the Greek letter ρ (pronounced “rho”). But because we have only sample data, we cannot\ncalculate the population correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient, r, is our estimate of the\nunknown population correlation coefficient.\n•\nρ = population correlation coefficient (unknown)\n•\nr = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data)\nAn important step in the correlation analysis is to determine if the correlation is significant. By this, we are\nasking if the correlation is strong enough to allow meaningful predictions for y based on values of x. One\nmethod to test the significance of the correlation is to employ a hypothesis test. The hypothesis test lets us\ndecide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ is close to zero or significantly different\nfrom zero. We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient r and the sample size n.\nIf the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the\ncorrelation coefficient is significant.\n•\nConclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x\nand y variables because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.\n•\nWhat the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between the x and y variables. If the\ntest concludes that the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we\nsay that the correlation coefficient is not significant.\nA hypothesis test can be performed to test if the correlation is significant. A hypothesis test is a statistical\nmethod that uses sample data to test a claim regarding the value of a population parameter. In this case, the\nhypothesis test will be used to test the claim that the population correlation coefficient ρ is equal to zero.\nUse these hypotheses when performing the hypothesis test:\n•\nNull hypothesis:\n•\nAlternate hypothesis:\nThe hypotheses can be stated in words as follows:\n•\nNull hypothesis\n: The population correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero.

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval. The second case, where we\nare asking for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variable y of a single experiment using a value of x,\nis called the prediction interval.\nThe prediction interval for an individual y for\ncan be calculated as\nwhere se is the standard deviation of the error term, sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable, and\nis\nthe critical value of the t-distribution at the\nconfidence level.\nTabulated values of the t-distribution are available in online references such as the Engineering Statistics\nHandbook (https://openstax.org/r/engineering_handbook). The mathematical computations for prediction\nintervals are complex, and usually the calculations are performed using software. The formula above can be\nimplemented in Excel to create a 95% prediction interval for the forecast for monthly revenue when\nis spent on monthly advertising. Figure 14.10 shows the detailed calculations in Excel to arrive at a\n95% prediction interval of (13,270.95, 15,370.09) for the monthly revenue. (The commands refer to the Excel\ndata table shown in Figure 14.9.)\n436\n14 • Regression Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 14.10 Calculations for 95% Prediction Interval for Monthly Revenue\nThis prediction interval can be interpreted as follows: there is 95% confidence that when the amount spent on\nmonthly advertising is $80,000, the corresponding monthly revenue will be between $13,270.95 and\n$15,370.09.\nVarious computer regression software packages provide programs within the regression functions to provide\nanswers to inquiries of estimated predicted values of y given various values chosen for the x-variable(s). For\nexample, the statistical program R provides these prediction intervals directly. It is important to know just\nwhich interval is being tested in the computer package because the difference in the size of the standard\ndeviations will change the size of the interval estimated. This is shown in Figure 14.11.\nFigure 14.11 Prediction and Confidence Intervals for Regression Equation at 95% Confidence Level\nFigure 14.11 shows visually the difference the standard deviation makes in the size of the estimated intervals.\nThe confidence interval, measuring the expected value of the dependent variable, is smaller than the\nprediction interval for the same level of confidence. The expected value method assumes that the experiment\nis conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method. The logic here is similar, although\nnot identical, to that discussed when developing the relationship between the sample size and the confidence\ninterval using the central limit theorem. There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation.

Adding\neach of the annual returns and dividing the sum by 10 results in a 22.4% average annual return. This 22.4% is\ncalled the arithmetic average return.\nThe geometric average return will be smaller than the arithmetic average return (unless the returns for all\nyears are identical). This is due to the basic arithmetic of compounding. Think of a very simple example in\nwhich you invest $100 for two years. If you have a positive return of 50% the first year and a negative 50%\nreturn the second year, you will have an arithmetic average return of\n, but you will have a\ngeometric average return of\n. With a 50% positive return the\nfirst year, you ended the year with $150. The second year, you lost 50% of that balance and were left with only\n$75.\nAnother important fact when studying average returns is that the order in which you earn the returns is not\nimportant. Consider what would have occurred if the returns in the two years were reversed, so that you faced\na loss of 50% in the first year of your investment and a gain of 50% in the second year of your investment. With\na −50% return in the first year, you would have ended that year with only $50. Then, if that $50 earned a\npositive 50% return the second year, you would have a $75 balance at the end of the two-year period. A\nnegative return of 50% followed by a positive return of 50% still results in an arithmetic average return of 0%",

Most investors, however, own\nshares of stock in multiple companies. This collection of stocks is known as a portfolio. Let’s explore why it is\nwise for investors to hold a portfolio of stocks rather than to pick just one favorite stock to own.\nWe saw that investors who owned DAL experienced an average annual return of 20.87% but also a large\nstandard deviation of 51.16%. Investors who used all their funds to purchase DAL stock did exceptionally well\nduring 2012–2014. But in 2020, those investors lost almost one-third of their money as COVID-19 caused a\nsharp reduction in air travel worldwide. To protect against these extreme outcomes, investors practice what is\ncalled diversification, or owning a variety of stocks in their portfolios.\nSuppose, for example, you have saved $50,000 that you want to invest. If you purchased $50,000 of DAL stock,\nyou would not be diversified. Your return would depend solely on the return on DAL stock. If, instead, you used\n$5,000 to purchase DAL stock and used the remaining $45,000 to purchase nine other stocks, you would be\ndiversifying. Your return would depend not only on DAL’s return but also on the returns of the other nine\nstocks in your portfolio. Investors practice diversification to manage risk.\nIt is akin to the saying “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” If you place all of your eggs in one basket\nand that basket breaks, all of your eggs will fall and crack. If you spread your eggs out across a number of\nbaskets, it is unlikely that all of the baskets will break and all of your eggs will crack. One basket may break,\nand you will lose the eggs in that basket, but you will still have your other eggs. The same idea holds true for\ninvesting. If you own stock in a company that does poorly, perhaps even goes out of business, you will lose the\nmoney you placed in that particular investment. However, with a diversified portfolio, you do not lose all your\nmoney because your money is spread out across a number of different companies.\n1\nTrefis Team and Great Speculations. “Is Peloton’s Tread+ Recall an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?” Forbes, May 7, 2021.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/05/07/is-pelotons-tread-recall-an-opportunity-to-buy-the-stock/\n2\nTomi Kilgore. “Peloton Stock Sinks to 8-Month Low after 125,000 Treadmills Recalled for ‘Risk of Injury or Death.’” MarketWatch.\nMay 6, 2021. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/peloton-stock-sinks-toward-9-month-low-after-125-000-treadmills-recalled-for-\nrisk-of-injury-or-death-11620233715\n458\n15 • How to Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDiversification\nFidelity Investments Inc. is a multinational financial services firm and one of the largest asset managers in\nthe world.

Finance)\nAs investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has\ngood years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just\nlike DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the\nsame for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return\nfor XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive\nreturn. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,\nwashing away some of the volatility.\nWhen an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.\nWhen two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the\nvolatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How\ncorrelated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.\nYou will recall from our study of correlation in Regression Analysis in Finance that a correlation coefficient\ndescribes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a\nperfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two\nvariables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more\n15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\n459\nstrongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated\nin a portfolio decreases risk.\nNotice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard\ndeviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less\nthan one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed\nto many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two\nstocks provides only a small decrease in risk.\nThis is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy\nis strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.\nWhen something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both\ncompanies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is\nspecific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure\nto the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience\npositive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.\nOn the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation\nthan those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM\nis likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the\nstandard deviation of the portfolio more.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHow to Build a Diversified Portfolio\nTV personality, former hedge fund manager, and author Jim Cramer encourages investors to build a\ndiversified portfolio, having no more than 20% of a portfolio in one sector.3 Watch this CNBC video\n(https://openstax.org/r/CNBC_video) to learn more about how he suggests investors can build a diversified\nportfolio by purchasing five to 10 stocks.\nPortfolio Size and Risk\nAs you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases.

The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

Geopolitical events, major storms, and pandemics can also impact the\nentire market. Investors in stocks cannot avoid this type of risk. This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that\ninvestors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.\nIn addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,4 the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as\nthe number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration in this\nsubsequent article by Statman (https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman) for context). Increasing the size\nof the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio\nincreases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How\nmany stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all\nfinancial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification\nthan a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients. A portfolio that consists of American Airlines,\nSpirit Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Jet Blue, along with a few other stocks, is\nnot very diversified because of the heavy concentration in the airline industry. The term diversified portfolio is\na relative concept, but the average investor can create a reasonably diversified portfolio with approximately a\ndozen stocks.\n15.3\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine risk premium.\n•\nExplain the concept of beta.\n•\nCompute the required return of a security using the CAPM.\nRisk-Free Rate\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a financial theory based on the idea that investors who are willing\nto hold stocks that have higher systematic risk should be rewarded more for taking on this market risk. The\nCAPM focuses on systematic risk, rather than a stock’s individual risk, because firm-specific risk can be\neliminated through diversification.\nSuppose that your grandparents have given you a gift of $20,000. After you graduate from college, you plan to\nwork for a few years and then apply to law school. You want to use the $20,000 your grandparents gave you to\npay for part of your law school tuition. It will be several years before you are ready to spend the money, and\nyou want to keep the money safe. At the same time, you would like to invest the money and have it grow until\nyou are ready to start law school.\nAlthough you would like to earn a return on the money so that you have more than $20,000 by the time you\nstart law school, your primary objective is to keep the money safe. You are looking for a risk-free investment.\nLending money to the US government is considered the lowest-risk investment that you can make. You can\npurchase a US Treasury security. The chances of the US government not paying its debts is close to zero.\nAlthough, in theory, no investment is 100% risk-free, investing in US government securities is generally",

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3. Monthly returns for DAL and for the S&P 500\nare plotted in the diagram. Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to a month from 2018 to 2020; for\nexample, the dot that lies furthest in the upper right-hand corner represents November 2020. The return for\nthe S&P 500 was 10.88% that month; this return is plotted along the horizontal axis. The return for DAL during\nNovember 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.\nYou can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return\nfor DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL\nis also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta. Beta\nmeasures the amount of systematic risk that DAL has.\nFigure 15.3 Calculation of Beta for DAL (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\n15.3 • The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n463\nCAPM Equation\nBecause DAL’s beta of 1.39 is greater than 1, DAL is riskier than the average stock in the market. Finance\ntheory suggests that investors who purchase DAL will expect a higher rate of return to compensate them for\nthis risk. DAL has 139% of the average stock’s systematic risk; therefore, investors in the stock should receive\n139% of the market risk premium.\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) equation is\nwhere Re is the expected return of the asset, Rf is the risk-free rate of return, and Rm is the expected return of\nthe market. Given the average S&P 500 return of 11.64% and the average US Treasury bill return of 3.36%, the\nexpected return of DAL would be calculated as\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCalculating Beta\nMany providers of stock data and investment information will list a company’s beta. Two internet sources\nthat can be used to find a company’s beta are Yahoo! Finance (https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo) and\nMarketWatch (https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact\nsame value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021, Yahoo! Finance reported that the\nbeta for DAL was 1.46,8 while MarketWatch reported it as 1.29.9 Both of these numbers are slightly\ndifferent from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.\nThere are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in\nthe beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta in Figure 15.3. Time frames\nranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different\nsources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are\nused in Figure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data. Finally, the S&P 500 is used to measure the market\nreturn in Figure 15.3; the S&P 500 is one of the most common measures of overall market returns, but\nalternatives exist and are used by some analysts\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCAPM\nWatch this video (https://openstax.org/r/pricing-model-capm) for further information about the CAPM.\n8\n“Delta Air Lines, Inc.

When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the\nembroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash\nflows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.\nTheoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In\nreality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an\napproximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall\nconclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and\nallows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.\nTo construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery\nmachine project using each of those discount rates. Table 16.6 below shows the NPV for several discount rates.\nNotice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate\nbecomes larger, the NPV falls and eventually becomes negative.\nThe information in Table 16.6 is presented in a graph in Figure 16.2. We can see that the graph crosses the\nhorizontal axis at about 14%. To the left, or at lower discount rates, the NPV is positive. If you are confident\nthat the firm’s cost of attracting funds is less than 14%, the company should accept the project. If the cost of\ncapital is more than 14%, however, the NPV is negative, and the company should reject the project.\nDiscount Rate NPV ($)\n0%\n10,000\n3%\n7,231\n9%\n2,836\n12%\n1,081\n14%\n42\n15%\n(442)\n18%\n(1,773)\n21%\n(2,939)\nTable 16.6 NPV for Various\nDiscount Rates\n16.2 • Net Present Value (NPV) Method\n485\nFigure 16.2 NPV Profile Graph\n16.3\nInternal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine internal rate of return (IRR).\n•\nCalculate internal rate of return.\n•\nList advantages and disadvantages of using the internal rate of return method.\nInternal Rate of Return (IRR) Calculation\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that sets the present value of the cash inflows equal to\nthe present value of the cash outflows. In considering whether Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the\nembroidery machine, the IRR method approaches the time value of money problem from a slightly different\nangle. Instead of using the company’s cost of attracting funds for the discount rate and solving for NPV, as we\ndid in the first NPV equation, we set NPV equal to zero and solve for the discount rate to find the IRR:\nThe IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV profile graph crosses the horizontal axis. If the IRR is greater\nthan the cost of capital, a project should be accepted. If the IRR is less than the cost of capital, a project should\nbe rejected. The NPV profile graph for the embroidery machine crossed the horizontal axis at 14%. Therefore,\nif Sam’s Sporting Goods can attract capital for less than 14%, the IRR exceeds the cost of capital and the\nembroidery machine should be purchased. However, if it costs Sam’s more than 14% to attract capital, the\nembroidery machine should not be purchased.\nIn other words, a company wants to accept projects that have an IRR that exceed the company’s cost of\nattracting funds. The cash flow from these projects will be great enough to cover the cost of attracting money\nfrom investors in addition to the other costs of the project. A company should reject any project that has an\nIRR less than the company’s cost of attracting funds; the cash flows from such a project are not enough to\ncompensate the investors for the use of their funds.\nCalculating IRR without a financial calculator is an arduous, time-consuming process that requires trial and\nerror to find the discount rate that makes NPV exactly equal zero. Your calculator uses the same type of trial-\nand-error iterative process, but because it uses an automated process, it can do so much more quickly than\nyou can. A problem that might require 30 minutes of detailed mathematical calculations by hand can be\n486\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompleted in a matter of seconds with the assistance of a financial calculator.\nAll the information your calculator needs to calculate IRR is the value of each cash flow and the time period in",

Because of this\nlimitation, the MIRR cannot be used to rank projects; it can only be used to make accept-or-reject decisions.\n16.5\nChoosing between Projects\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nChoose between mutually exclusive projects.\n•\nCompare projects with different lives.\n•\nCompare projects of different scales.\n•\nRank projects when resources are limited.\nSo far, we have considered methods for deciding to accept or to reject a single stand-alone project.\nSometimes, managers must make decisions regarding which of two projects to accept, or a company might be\nfaced with a number of good, acceptable projects and have to decide which of those projects to take on during\n490\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe current year.\nChoosing between Mutually Exclusive Projects\nEarlier in this chapter, we saw that the embroidery machine that Sam’s Sporting Goods was considering had a\npositive NPV, making it a project that Sam’s should accept. However, another, more expensive embroidery\nmachine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-\nduty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more\nrevenue. The two embroidery machines are mutually exclusive projects. Mutually exclusive projects compete\nwith one another; purchasing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery\nmachine.\nTable 16.11 shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as\nwell as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but it will generate more cash inflows\nin years 3 through 6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to decisions to accept the projects. Also, both\nmachines have an IRR exceeding the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to decisions to accept\nthe projects.\nWhen considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the\nmanagers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to\ntake the project with the highest NPV. Remember that the goal is to choose projects that add value to the\ncompany. Because the NPV of a project is the estimate of how much value it will create, choosing the project\nwith the higher NPV is choosing the project that will create the greater value.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nNPV\nIRR\nRegular Machine ($)\n(16,000) 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 2,835.62 14.10%\nHeavy-Duty Machine ($) (25,000) 2,000 4,000 8,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 3,970.67 13.20%\nTable 16.11\nLINK TO LEARNING\nOlympic Project Economics\nThe investment analysis procedures used by companies are also used by government entities when\nevaluating projects.

The\nNPV of the newer truck is $80,658.\nBecause both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which\ntruck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its\nhigher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made\nsimply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV\nthan the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.\nThere are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life\nproject concludes, another, similar project will be available.\nReplacement Chain Approach\nWith the replacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal\nthe life of the long-life project. You can purchase the newer, lower-mileage ice-cream truck and run your\nbusiness for six years. To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last\nfor three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for\nthe next three years. In essence, you are comparing a six-year project with two consecutive three-year projects\nso that both options will generate cash inflows for six years. Your timeline for the projects (comparing an\nolder, larger truck with a newer, lower-mileage truck) will look like Table 16.12:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOlder Truck ($)\n($50,000) 40,000 40,000\n40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000\nOlder Truck ($)\n(50,000)\nNewer Truck ($)\n(50,000) 30,000 30,000\n30,000 30,000 30,000 30,000\nTable 16.12\nThe present values of all of the cash inflows and outflows from purchasing two of the older, larger trucks\nconsecutively are added together to find the NPV of that alternative. The NPV of this alternative is $86,645,\nwhich is higher than the NPV of $80,658 of the newer truck, as shown in Table 16.13:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOlder Truck ($)\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\n40,000\nOlder Truck ($)\n(50,000)\nNet Present Value (50,000) 36,363.64 33,057.85 (7,513.15) 27,320.54 24,836.85 22,578.96\nTable 16.13\nWhen using the replacement chain approach, the short-term project is repeated any number of times to equal\nthe length of the longer-term project.

For example, when choosing between a five-year project and a seven-year project, the\nshort one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated five times\nto get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.\nEqual Annuity Approach\nThe equal annuity approach assumes that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated\nforever. This approach involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\n•\nThe NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\n•\nThe NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\nproject.\n•\nFor the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.\n•\nFor the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\nformula.\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that\nprojects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions\nare likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the\nfuture, these changes are potentially greater.\nChoosing Projects When Resources Are Limited\nChoosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will\nchoose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount\nof capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several\npositive NPV projects. The goal is to maximize the total NPV of the firm’s projects while remaining within\nbudget constraints.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nProfitability Index\nManagers should reject any project with a negative NPV. When managers find themselves with an array of\nprojects with a positive NPV, the profitability index can be used to choose among those projects. To learn\n16.5 • Choosing between Projects\n493\nmore, watch this video about how a company might use the profitability index (https://openstax.org/r/\nmight-use).\nFor example, suppose Southwest Manufacturing is considering the seven projects displayed in Table 16.14.\nEach of the projects has a positive NPV and would add value to the company. The firm has a budget of $200\nmillion to put toward new projects in the upcoming year. Doing all seven of the projects would require initial\ninvestments totaling $430 million. Thus, although all of the projects are good projects, Southwest\nManufacturing cannot fund them all in the upcoming year and must choose among these projects.

            "chunk": "If we use the constant dividend discount model to estimate the cost of equity for Bluebonnet Industries, the\nWACC is computed as\nCalculating WACC in Practice\nThe equation for calculating WACC is straightforward. However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be\nused. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return\nhas been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from\nwhat it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk\npremiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n513\nThe same issue with how much historical data should be considered arises when calculating a company’s beta.\nDifferent financial managers can calculate significantly different betas even for well-established, stable\ncompanies. In April 2021, for example, the beta for IBM was reported as 0.97 by MarketWatch and as 1.25 by\nYahoo! Finance.\nThe CAPM estimate of the cost of equity capital for IBM is significantly different depending on what source is\nused for the company’s beta and what value is used for the market risk premium. Using a market risk\npremium of 5%, the beta of 0.97 provided by MarketWatch, and a risk-free rate of 3% results in a cost of capital\nof\nIf, instead, a market risk premium of 8% and the beta of 1.25 provided by Yahoo! Finance are used, the cost of\ncapital is estimated to be\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating the Equity Cost of Capital\nAlthough the calculation of the cost of capital using the CAPM equation is simple and straightforward, there\nis not one definitive equity cost of capital for a company that all financial managers will agree on. Consider\nthe eight companies spotlighted in Table 17.3.\nFour estimates of the equity cost of capital are calculated for each firm. The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%. If you assume instead that the\naverage long-run return on the S&P 500 is 11%, then people who purchase a portfolio of those stocks are\nrewarded by earning 8 percentage points more than the 3% they would earn investing in the risk-free\nsecurity.\nThe last two estimates of the cost of equity capital for each company also use the same risk-free rate of 3%\nand the possible market risk premiums of 5% and 8%.

Finance; MarketWatch)\n514\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example,\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an\nestimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much\nhigher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and\nRubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with\nan estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable\nassumptions.\nWhat is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A\nfinancial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different\nchoices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.",

Net debt is the\namount of debt that would remain if a company used all of its liquid assets to pay off as much debt as\npossible. Net debt is calculated as the firm’s total debt, both short-term and long-term, minus the firm’s cash\nand cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are current assets that can quickly and easily be converted into cash,\nsuch as Treasury bills, commercial paper, and marketable securities.\nConsider, for example, Apple, which had $112.436 billion in total debt in 2020. The company also had $38.016\nbillion in cash and cash equivalents. This meant that the net debt for Apple was only $74.420 billion. If Apple\nused all of its cash and cash equivalents to pay debt, it would be left with $74.420 billion in debt.2\nCash and cash equivalents can be viewed as negative debt. For firms with relatively low levels of cash, this\nadjustment will not have a large impact on the overall WACC estimate. However, the adjustment can be\nimportant for firms that hold substantial cash reserves.\n17.4\nCapital Structure Choices\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between a levered and an unlevered firm.\n•\nExplain why the choice of capital structure does not impact the value of a firm in perfect financial markets.\n•\nCalculate the interest tax shield.\n•\nExplain how the interest tax shield encourages the use of leverage.\nSo far, we have taken the company’s capital structure as given. Each firm’s capital structure, however, is a\nresult of intentional decisions made by the financial managers of the company. We now turn our attention to\nthe issues that financial managers consider when making these decisions.\nThe Unlevered Firm\nLet’s begin our discussion of capital structure choices by exploring the financing decisions you would face if\nyou were to start a T-shirt business.

The competition itself will last for a month; cyclists will arrive early to train in the local climate.\nNews coverage will be significant, meaning a lot of media personnel will be visiting your area. In addition to\nfans attending the event, it is expected that tourism will increase over the next year as recreational cyclists will\nwant to ride the route of the professional race. You decide to operate a business for one year that will sell T-\nshirts highlighting this event.\nYou will need to make an up-front investment of $40,000 to start the business. You estimate that you will\ngenerate a cash flow of $52,000, after you cover all of your operating costs, at the end of next year. You know\nthat these profits are risky; you think a 10% risk premium is appropriate for the level of riskiness of the\nbusiness. If the risk-free rate is 4%, this means that the appropriate discount rate for you to use is 14%. The\nvalue of this business opportunity is\nThis looks as if it will be a profitable business that should be undertaken. However, you do not have the\n$40,000 for the up-front investment and will need to raise it.\nFirst, consider raising money solely by selling ownership shares to your family and friends. How much would\nthose shares be worth? The value of the stock would be equal to the present value of the expected future cash\nflows. The potential stockholders would expect to receive $45,614 in one year.

Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases. Once the company’s debt\nexceeds its guaranteed cash flow, which is $18,000 in our example, debt holders face some risk that the\ncompany will not be able to pay them. At that point, the cost of debt rises above the risk-free rate. As the\n518\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nweight of debt approaches 100%, the cost of debt capital approaches the cost of equity of the unlevered firm.\nIn other words, if you financed the T-shirt business solely through the use of debt, the debt holders would\nrequire a 14% return because they would be bearing the entire risk of the business and would demand to be\nrewarded for doing so.\nAs the leverage of the firm increases, both the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity capital increase.\nHowever, as the firm’s leverage increases, it is using proportionately more of the relatively cheaper source of\ncapital—debt— and proportionately less of the relatively more expensive source of capital—equity. Thus, the\nWACC remains constant as leverage increases, despite the rising cost of each component.\nAmount of Debt Amount of Equity Weight of Debt Weight of Equity Cost of Debt Cost of Equity WACC\n$ -\n$45,614\n0%\n100%\n0.0400\n0.1400\n14%\n$5,000\n$40,614\n11%\n89%\n0.0400\n0.1523\n14%\n$10,000\n$35,614\n22%\n78%\n0.0400\n0.1681\n14%\n$15,000\n$30,614\n33%\n67%\n0.0400\n0.1890\n14%\n$17,000\n$28,614\n37%\n63%\n0.0400\n0.1994\n14%\n$20,000\n$25,614\n44%\n56%\n0.0600\n0.2025\n14%\n$30,000\n$15,614\n66%\n34%\n0.0800\n0.2553\n14%\n$40,000\n$5,614\n88%\n12%\n0.1000\n0.4250\n14%\nTable 17.4 Alternative Capital Structures for Your T-Shirt Business\nThe Impact of Taxes\nIn perfect capital markets, the choice of capital structure will not impact the value of the firm or the cost of the\nfirm’s financing. In the real world, however, capital markets are not perfect. One of the important market\nimperfections is the presence of corporate taxes. Because the choice of capital structure can impact the taxes\nthat a company pays, in the real world, capital structure can impact the cost of capital and the firm’s value.\nAssume that your T-shirt business venture will result in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $52,000\nnext year and that the corporate tax rate is 28%.

Where does the extra $78.40 to pay investors come from? It comes from the\nreduction in taxes that the firm pays due to leverage. If the company uses no debt, it pays $14,560 in taxes.

The direct costs of financial distress include\nfees paid to lawyers, consultants, appraisers, and auctioneers. The indirect costs include loss of customers and\nsuppliers.\nTrade-Off Theory\nTrade-off theory weighs the advantages and disadvantages of using debt in the capital structure. The\nadvantage of using debt is the interest tax shield. The disadvantage of using debt is that it increases the risk of\nfinancial distress and the costs associated with financial distress.\nA company has an incentive to increase leverage to exploit the interest tax shield. However, too much debt will\nmake it more likely that the company will default and incur financial distress costs. Calculating the precise\nbalance between these two is difficult if not impossible.\nFor companies with a low level of debt, the risk of default is low, and the main impact of an increase in\nleverage will be an increase in the interest tax shield. At some point, however, the tax savings that result from\nincreasing the amount of debt in the capital structure will be just offset by the increased probability of\nincurring the costs of financial distress. For firms that have higher costs of financing distress, this point will be\nreached sooner.

Starting as a DVD rental company, Netflix\nquickly shifted its model to content streaming. In recent years, the company has become a major producer\nof content, and it is currently the largest media/entertainment company by market capitalization. It is\nexpensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content. Netflix has funded much of its content through\nselling debt.\nYou can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answers the\ncompany provides to common investor questions (https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can\nalso find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s\nbalance sheet has increased over the past few years.\nFigure 17.4 demonstrates how the value of a levered firm varies with the level of debt financing used. Vu is the\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\ninterest and taxes (EBIT). Once the interest expense equals EBIT, the firm will have no taxable income. There is\nno tax benefit from paying more interest after that point.\n17.5 • Optimal Capital Structure\n521\nFigure 17.4 Maximum Value of a Levered Firm\nAs the firm increases debt and increases the value of the tax benefit of debt, it also increases the probability of\nfacing financial distress. The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to\ndetermine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target. Reducing debt and increasing equity would require transaction costs that might be quite\nsignificant.\nTable 17.7 shows the average WACC for some common industries. The calculations are based on corporate\ninformation at the end of December 2020. A risk-free rate of 3% and a market-risk premium of 5% are assumed\nin the calculations. You can see that the capital structure used by firms varies widely by industry. Companies in\nthe online retail industry are financed almost entirely through equity capital; on average, less than 7% of the\ncapital comes from debt for those companies.

We will be using the\npercent-of-sales method to forecast some expenses for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the example used\nthroughout the chapter. This method relies on sales data, further highlighting why accuracy in forecasting\nsales is crucial.\nSales as the Driver\nA significant portion of a business’s costs are driven by how much it sells. Thus, the sales forecast is the\nnecessary first step in preparing a financial forecast. Common costs driven by sales include direct product\ncosts, direct labor costs, and other key variable costs (i.e., costs that vary proportionately to sales), such as\nsales commissions.\nLooking to the Past\nForecasting sales is not always an easy task, as no one knows the future. We can, however, use the information\nwe do have to forecast future sales with the greatest accuracy possible. Most firms start by looking at the past.\nA firm may look at past sales from a variety of prior periods. It’s common to look at the past 12 months to\nestimate the coming 12 months. Looking at 12 consecutive months helps identify seasonality of sales trends,\nwhat time of year sales tend to drop off and when they increase, possible sales spikes that might reoccur, and\nany other trends that tend to appear over a 12-month period. In Figure 18.7, we see Clear Lake’s sales by\nmonth for the past 12 months.\nPast data is often used in conjunction with probabilities and weighted average calculations derived from\nprobabilities. Though used in several areas of forecasting, this approach is particularly common in drafting the\nsales forecast. Using multiple scenarios and the probability of each scenario occurring is a common approach\nto estimating future sales.\nFigure 18.7 Historical Sales Data\nWe can see at first glance that sales remain fairly steady from January to April. Sales then goes up significantly\nin April and May, seem to peak in June, taper off a bit in July, then decline steeply from August to the end of the\nyear, with the lowest sales being in November and December. Though not exact, it’s easy to quickly see that\nsales follow a seasonal pattern. We will focus on just one year of data here to keep things simple. However, it’s\nimportant to note that when a firm has a seasonal sales pattern, it normally uses more than one year of data\nto detect and evaluate the pattern. It’s not uncommon for firms to have a seasonal sales pattern that\nfluctuates based on an external factor such as weather patterns, patterns in business or demand, or other\n18.2 • Forecasting Sales\n541\nfactors such as holidays. Common examples might include farm-based businesses that function on a weather\npattern for harvesting and selling crops or a toy company that fluctuates around gift-giving holidays.\nThis knowledge is helpful when assembling a first pass at the next year’s sales forecast. Using common-size\nand horizontal (trend) analyses on sales is also helpful, as shown in Figure 18.8. We can see the exact\npercentages that sales went up or down each month:\n•\nIn January, the company had sales of $9,000, which was\nof the total annual sales.\n•\nIn June, the company had $19,000 sales, which was\nof the total annual sales and\nof January sales.\nFigure 18.8 Historical Sales Data as Percentages\nOnce a baseline in the 12-month period is assessed, it can also be helpful to look for trends in other ways. For\nexample, the past several years might be assessed to see if there is a trend in total growth or decline for those\nyears on a summary basis or by period. Clear Lake Sporting Goods had sales in the current year of $126,000, in\nthe prior year of $105,000, and two years ago of $89,000. This reflects a 20% increase and an 18% increase,\nrespectively. It might be reasonable to expect a roughly 18 to 20% increase in total sales in the future with only\nthis information in mind. Keep in mind that we will learn about many other factors to consider in the forecast,\nso the 18 to 20% increase is a good general guideline to consider along with other factors.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nSales Forecast for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nReview the 2020 annual report for Big 5 Sporting Goods (https://openstax.org/r/\n2020_annual_report_for_Big_5_Sporting_Goods). Locate the consolidated statements of operations on page\nF-7. Using the company’s net sales figures for the current and prior years, what percentage might you\nrecommend for their sales forecast for the next year?\nSolution:\nBig 5’s sales for 2020 and 2019 were $1,041,212,000 and $996,495,000, respectively. This represents a 4.5%\ngrowth from the prior year. Forecasted sales, based solely on this information, might be appropriate at\n4.5% growth for the next year, keeping in mind that many other factors should also be considered along",

            "chunk": "for future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many people in\n18.3 • Pro Forma Financials\n545\nquarantine still wanting to make healthy lifestyle choices, sporting goods stores were making record sales.\nRecord-breaking sales, however, are not certain in the future. The impacts of the pandemic are extremely\ndifficult to predict, making it a challenge for Big 5 Sporting Goods and other companies to assemble pro\nforma financial statements.\n(sources: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/27/2115470/0/en/Big-5-Sporting-Goods-\nCorporation-Announces-Record-Fiscal-2020-Third-Quarter-Results.html; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/\ninvestors-want-big-5-sporting-054658521.html; https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/accounting-audit/\nnews/21206691/four-ways-covid19-will-impact-2021-financial-forecasting-and-planning)\nDetermine Potential Changes in Variables\nSo far, we have focused on using historical common-size statements to create a draft (not a final version) of\nthe forecast. This is because the past isn’t always a perfect indicator of the future, and our finances don’t\nalways follow a linear pattern. We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we\nknow to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.\nMany items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,\ngather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the\npotential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an\nexhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.\n•\nIt has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in\nmonthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.\n•\nIt will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to\nbegin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s\nmonthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,\nand August.\n•\nThe company has just finished updating its employee compensation package. It goes into effect in January\nof the new year and will result in an overall 4% increase in the cost of labor.\n•\nThe landlord indicated that rent will increase by $50 per month starting July 1.\n•\nSome fixed assets will be fully depreciated by the end of March. Thus, depreciation expense will go down\nby $25 per month beginning in April.\n•\nThere are rumors of new regulations that will impact the costs of importing some of the more difficult-to-\nobtain hunting supplies.

As we saw earlier in the chapter, we begin with forecasted sales because they are\nthe basis for many of the forecasted costs.\nLet’s begin with the sales forecast for Clear Lake Sporting Goods that we saw earlier in the chapter, in Figure\n18.9, and use it along with the prior year income statement by month shown in Figure 18.12. We will consider\nother data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.12 Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month\nThe first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income. Figure 18.13 shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods using all of this data.\nFigure 18.13 Forecasted Income Statement\nForecast the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash",

Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),\nand the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other\nexpenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.\nWe learned in Financial Statements that net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.\nIt’s also common to find other general policies or procedures that help drive performance and aid in\nforecasting balances. For example, if the company has a goal of maintaining a certain level of inventory or a\nminimum balance in its cash account, that information can be used to guide the estimate for those accounts.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n549\n18.5\nForecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a cash flow forecast.\n•\nAssess a cash flow forecast to determine future cash funding needs.\n•\nUse pro forma financial statements and cash flow forecasts to assess the value of growth to the firm.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will use the forecasted income statement, forecasted balance sheet, and\nother information we know about the firm’s policies and goals for the coming year to generate and assess a\ncash flow forecast.\nCreate a Cash Flow Forecast\nA cash flow forecast isn’t overly complex, yet it is not easy to assemble because it requires making many\nassumptions about the future. A cash forecast begins with the beginning cash balance, adds anticipated cash\ninflows, and deducts anticipated cash outflows. This identifies cash surpluses and shortages.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, we see in Figure 18.15 that the company begins with cash of\n$42,581,000 in January of the new year. Next, it lists the cash inflows, or cash received from customers. Given\nthe assumption that customers pay in 90-day terms, the cash flow is filled in by plugging in the sales forecast\nfor the three prior months. For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the\nnet sales forecast for March (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.15 Forecasted Cash Inflows\nNext, Clear Lake identifies cash outflows, which include accounts payable, salaries, rent, utilities, dividends,\nand interest payments. Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods\nsold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, in Figure 18.16, we\nsee that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted\nincome statement.\nSalaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent. Utilities,\nlike accounts payable, are assumed to be paid within 30 days. Thus, the cash outflow for utilities is the utilities\nexpense for the prior month from the forecasted income statement.\nManagement intends to pay a quarterly dividend of $10,000. Thus, in Figure 18.16, we see $10,000 cash\noutflows forecasted for March, June, September, and December. Interest on the long-term liability is paid\nquarterly. Thus, the $500 cash outflows in March, June, September, and December are simply the monthly\ninterest expense of $167 from the income statement, summed for each quarter.\n550\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.16 Forecasted Cash Inflows and Outflows\nUsing a Cash Forecast to Determine Additional Funds Needed\nFinally, at the end of the cash flow forecast, cash outflows are subtracted from the cash inflows. This identifies\nwhether a cash surplus (extra) or cash deficit (not enough) exists for each month. For example, in Figure\n18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,\nwhich results in a cash deficit of $13,000.\nClear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess\ntheir monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,\nthe deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that\nthe company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March. It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth\nIt’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow.

While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months.

In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula\nthen multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last\nquarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new\nyear by roughly 2%.\nFigure 18.19 Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel\n3.\nAs Clear Lake continues to fill out its forecasted income statement, the next formula we see is a simple\nsum formula to calculate net sales in B8 (see Figure 18.20). It’s a simple formula that subtracts sales\nreturns and allowances in B7 from gross sales in B4. Similar formulas are also found in B10 for gross\nmargin and B18 for net income.\n4.\nIn cell B9, we see a multiplication formula that multiplies sales from B4 by 0.5, or 50%. This is because\n554\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmanagement feels that cost of goods sold will remain the same as last year, in most quarters at least, and\nlast year’s percentage was 50%.\n5.\nRent, depreciation, and salaries are all simply typed in, as they are fixed expenses that remain the same as\nlast year.\n6.\nThe utilities calculation, found in cell B14, is somewhat similar to the sales calculation. The total utilities\nexpense from O14 is multiplied by the current month’s sales in B4 divided by the total annual sales in O4.\nThis spreads out the utility cost by month based on the percentage of annual sales.\nFigure 18.20 Forecasted Income Statement Formulas\nClear Lake’s forecasted balance sheet ties very closely to both the forecasted income statement and the prior\nyear’s income statement. In Figure 18.21, we see in C7 an addition formula using the sum of the current\nmonth and three months of prior sales as an estimate of the ending accounts receivable balance. The formula\nfor inventory is similar but forward looking. In C8, inventory is estimated by adding the cost of goods sold for\nthe current month and next three months from the forecasted income statement.\nTotal current assets in C10 is calculated with a SUM formula that adds together the values in all the selected\ncells. Amounts such as short-term investments and common stock that are not anticipated to change are\nsimply typed as a number in the cell. Much like in the income statement, subtotals are found in C13 for total\nassets, C17 for current liabilities, C24 for total equity, and C25 for total liabilities and equity. Retained earnings\nin C23 pulls the ending retained earnings balance from the end of last year (hidden in column B) and adds the\n18.6 • Using Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\n555\nnet income for January in the forecasted income statement to get the current month’s ending balance.\nFigure 18.21 Forecasted Balance Sheet Formulas\nMuch like the balance sheet, the cash forecast also relies heavily on data from the forecasted income\nstatement as well as the forecasted balance sheet. To begin the year, in Figure 18.22, we see that the formula\nin B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three\nmonths prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected\nfrom customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.\nUtilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be\nthe utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement. Note that interest payments are\nassumed to be zero in January and February, but in March, the formula in D14 sums the interest expenses on\nthe forecasted income statement for January, February, and March. This is because interest is paid quarterly.\nFinally, note the formula in C4. The beginning cash balance for a given month is the same as the ending cash\nbalance from the prior month; thus, the figure in B18 is linked to C4 to start the new month.\n556\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.22 Cash Forecast Formulas\nUsing Excel Functions to Balance\nOnce we get a draft of the forecasts outlined, then the tinkering starts.

When completed, however, before finalizing the forecast, management will want to use Excel functions to balance the forecast. This is accomplished by using Excel’s Goal Seek function, which allows you to change a variable in the spreadsheet to achieve a desired result. In this case, the goal is to balance the forecasted income statement, meaning that the forecasted income statement must equal the actual income statement from the prior year. To balance the forecast, first make sure that the formulas are set up correctly. Then, in the forecasted income statement, select the cell containing the desired variable. In this case, the variable is the ending retained earnings balance. In the Goal Seek window, type the desired ending retained earnings balance from the prior year’s income statement in the Set Cell box. In the To Value box, type the desired ending retained earnings balance. In the By Changing Cell box, type the cell containing the variable you want to change. In this case, the variable is the January net income, so type B18 in the By Changing Cell box. Then click OK. The Goal Seek window will then show you the variable that needs to be changed to achieve the desired result. In this case, the January net income needs to be changed to $22,000 to achieve the desired ending retained earnings balance of$22,000. This is the amount that the company needs to increase sales to achieve the desired ending retained earnings balance. This process can be repeated for the forecasted balance sheet and cash forecast to ensure that the forecast is balanced. Once the forecast is balanced, the forecasts can be finalized and used to guide the company’s financial decision making."

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.\nNet working capital possibilities can be thought of as a spectrum from negative working capital to positive, as\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n567\nexplained in Table 19.1.\nNegative Net Working Capital\nZero Net Working Capital\nPositive Net Working Capital\nCurrent liabilities are greater than\ncurrent assets.\nCurrent assets equal current\nliabilities.\nCurrent assets are greater than\ncurrent liabilities.\nCould indicate a liquidity problem.\nThere is difficulty satisfying current\nobligations.\nIndicates that current assets could\ncover current obligations. However,\nthere is no positive margin (safety\ncushion) or “liquid reserve” to\nsatisfy unexpected cash needs.\nIndicates that the company can\nmeet its current obligations.\nHowever, excessively high net\nworking capital could mean too\nlittle cash and therefore an\nopportunity cost (forgoing rates of\nreturn on alternative investment).\nTable 19.1 Spectrum of Net Working Capital\nMeasures of Financial Health provides information on a variety of financial ratios to help users of financial\nstatements understand the strengths and weakness of companies’ financial statements. Three of the financial\nratios covered in that chapter are brought back into this chapter’s discussion to demonstrate how financial\nmanagers examine working capital and liquidity. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted\ninto cash. Those ratios are the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio. A higher ratio indicates a\ngreater level of liquidity.\nThe formulas for the three liquidity ratios are:\nNotice how the current ratio includes the two elements of net working capital—current assets and current\nliabilities. It makes for a quick comparison of relative size or proportion.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCurrent Ratio\nA company has $2,000,000 of current assets, while its current liabilities are $1,000,000. What is the current\nratio, and what does it mean?\nSolution:\nThe current ratio would be\nwhich is a 2:1 proportion of current asset value to\nthe amount of the current liabilities. This means that if all the current assets could be converted to cash,\nthen the current liabilities could be satisfied two times.\nThere are two drawbacks to the current ratio: (1) it is a working capital analytic as of a point in time but is not\nindicative of future liquidity or future cash flows and (2) as an indicator of liquidity, it can be deceptive if a\nsignificant proportion of the current assets are inventory, supplies, or prepaid expenses. Inventory is not very\nliquid as it can take an extended time period to convert to cash, and assets such as supplies and prepaid",

Assuming $1,000,000 of current liabilities, what would be the cash ratio and what\ndoes it mean?\nSolution:\nThe cash ratio would be\nand the amount of cash is enough to pay the\ncurrent bills by $100,000.\nWorking capital ratios, like any financial ratio, are most valuable when examined in light of trends and in\ncomparison to industry/peer averages. For example, a deteriorating current ratio over several quarters (a\ndecline in the company’s current ratio) could indicate a reduced ability to pay bills.\nWorking capital ratios are also compared to industry averages, which are available in databases produced by\nsuch financial publishers as Dun & Bradstreet, Dow Jones Company, and the Risk Management Association\n(RMA). These information services are available via subscriptions and through many libraries. For example, if a\ncompany’s current ratio is 0.9 while the industry average is 2.0, then the company is less liquid than the\naverage company in its industry and strategies, and techniques need to be considered to change things and to\nbetter compete with peer groups. Industry averages can be aspirational, motivating management to set\nliquidity goals and best practices for working capital management.\nIt is common to think about working capital with a simple assumption: current assets are being “financed” by\ncurrent liabilities. However, such an assumption may be an oversimplification. Some level of current assets is\noften necessary to meet longer-term obligations, and in that way, you could think of some amount of current\nassets as a permanent based of working capital that may need to be financed with longer-term sources of\ncapital.\nThink of a company with seasonal business. During busy times, more working capital will be needed than\nduring certain other portions of the year, such as less busy times. But there will always be some level—a\npermanent base—of working capital needed. Think of it this way: the total working capital of many companies\nwill ebb and flow depending on many variables such as the operating cycle, production needs, and the growth\nof revenue. Therefore, working capital can be thought of as having a permanent base that is always needed\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n569\nand a total working capital amount that increases when activity levels (i.e., production and sales volume) are\nhigher (see Figure 19.2).\nThe Cash Cycle\nThe cash cycle, also called the cash conversion cycle, is the time period between when a business begins\nproduction and acquires resources from its suppliers (for example, acquisition of materials and other forms of\ninventory) and when it receives cash from its customers.

The cash cycle for the company is 57.2\ndays. Calculate the inventory conversion, receivables collection, and payable deferral periods.\nSolution:\nInventory conversion period:\n•\n•\nReceivables collection period:\n•\n•\nPayables deferral period:\n•\n•\nThe solution (the entire cash conversion cycle) is also illustrated in a chart, Figure 19.3.\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n571\nFigure 19.3 Cash Conversion Cycle\nShortening the inventory conversion period and the receivables collection period or lengthening the payables\ndeferral period shortens the cash conversion cycle. Financial managers monitor and analyze each component\nof the cash conversion cycle. Ideally, a company’s management should minimize the number of days it takes\nto convert inventory to cash while maximizing the amount of time it takes to pay suppliers.\nQuickly converting inventory to sales speeds up cash inflows and shortens the cash cycle, but it also could help\nreduce inventory losses as a result of obsolescence. Inventory becomes obsolete because of a variety of\nfactors including time—inventory that has not been sold for a long period of time and is not expected to be\nsold in the future has to be written down or written off according to accounting rules. Write-offs of inventory\ncan result in significant losses for a company. In the food business, inventory conversion periods take on great\nimportance because of spoilage of perishable goods; in retailing, seasonal items lose value the longer they\nstay on the shelves.\nVarious inventory management techniques are used to shorten production time in manufacturing, and in\nretailing, strategies are used to reduce the amount of time a product sits on the shelf or is stored in the\nwarehouse. Production techniques such as just-in-time inventory systems and marketing and pricing\nstrategies can have an impact on the number of days in the inventory conversion cycle.\nFor the receivables collection period, a relatively long receivables collection period means that the company is\nhaving trouble collecting cash from its customers and so whatever can be done to speed up collections while\nstill offering competitive credit terms should be pursued by financial managers. For example, companies that\nconverted paper invoicing to e-invoicing most likely reduce the average collection period by some number of\ndays, as it makes sense that if a bill is transmitted electronically, lag time is cut (no delays because of “snail\nmail”) and collections (payments back to the company from customers) may happen sooner. Other credit\nmanagement techniques, some of which are explained in subsequent sections, can help minimize and control\nthe receivables collection period.\nThe payables deferral period is the one element that probably cannot be optimized without violating credit\nterms. Certainly, cash balances can be conserved by delaying payments to vendors for as long as possible;\nhowever, payments on trade credit need to be made on time or the company’s relationship with the supplier\ncan suffer. In a worst-case scenario, the company’s credit rating could also deteriorate.\nA credit rating, also called a credit score, is a measure produced by an independent agency indicating the\n572",

The ability to generate consistent positive cash flow from\noperations allows a retailer like Walmart to operate with relatively low amounts of working capital.\nThe credit policies of a company also affect working capital. A company with a liberal credit policy will require a\ngreater amount of working capital, as collection periods of accounts receivable are longer and therefore tie up\n1\nWalmart Inc. “2020 Annual Report.” 2020. https://corporate.walmart.com/media-library/document/2020-walmart-annual-\nreport/_proxyDocument?id=00000171-a3ea-dfc0-af71-b3fea8490000\n574\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmore dollars in receivables.\nAlmost all businesses will have times when additional working capital is needed to pay bills, meet the payroll\n(salaries and wages), and plan for accrued expenses. The wait for the cash to flow into the company’s treasury\nfrom the collection of receivables and cash sales can be longer during tough times.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government made paycheck protection program (PPP) loans available\nto help alleviate working capital problems for small and large business when the economy slowed because of\nshutdowns and social distancing. And although 60 percent of the PPP loan proceeds were to go to cover\npayroll-related costs, 40 percent could be used to bolster working capital to meet rent, utilities costs, and some\ninterest expense while companies were “treading water”—waiting for positive cash flow to pick up under a\nrecovery.2\nIt isn’t just during downturns that working capital is strained. Growing companies, even if they are extremely\nprofitable, need additional working capital as they ramp up operations by acquiring raw materials, component\nparts, supplies, or other forms of inventory; hiring temporary or additional employees; and taking on new\nprojects. Whenever additional resources are needed, working capital is also needed.\nSome of the current assets and expenditures needed in a growing company may need to be financed from\nsources that are not spontaneous financing—trade credit (accounts payable). Such forms of external\nfinancing such as lines of credit, short-term bank loans, inventory-based loans (also called floor planning),\nand the factoring of accounts receivables might have to be relied upon.\n19.2\nWhat Is Trade Credit?\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompute the cost of trade credit.\n•\nDefine cash discount.\n•\nDefine discount period.\n•\nDefine credit period.\nTrade credit, also known as accounts payable, is a critical part of a business’s working capital management\nstrategy. Trade credit is granted by vendors to creditworthy companies when those companies purchase\nmaterials, inventory, and services.\nA company’s purchasing system is usually integrated with other functions such production planning and sales\nforecasting. Purchasing managers search for and evaluate vendors, negotiate order quantities, and prepare\npurchase orders. In carrying out the purchasing process, credit terms are granted by the company’s vendors\nand purchases of inventory and services can be made on trade credit accounts—allowing the purchaser time\nto pay. The purchaser carries an accounts payable balance until the account is paid.\nTrade credit is referred to as spontaneous financing, as it occurs spontaneously with the gearing up of\noperations and the additional investment in current assets. Think of it this way: If sales are increasing, so too is\nproduction. Increased sales mean more current assets (accounts receivable and inventory), and increased\nsales mean increases in accounts payable (financing happening spontaneously with increased sales and\ninventory purchases). Compared to other financing arrangements, such as lines of credit and bank loans,\ntrade credit is convenient, simple, and easy to use.\nOnce a company is approved for trade credit, there is no paperwork or contracts to sign, as is the case with\nvarious forms of bank financing. Invoices specify the credit terms, and there is usually no interest expense\nassociated with trade credit. Accounts payable is a type of obligation that is interest-free and is distinguished\nfrom debt obligations, such as notes payable, that require the creditor to pay back principal and interest.\n2\nUS Small Business Administration. “PPP Loan Forgiveness.” n.d. https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-\noptions/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-loan-forgiveness\n19.2 • What Is Trade Credit?\n575\nHow Trade Credit Works\nTrade credit is common in B2B (business to business) transactions and is analogous to consumer spending",

Using accounts payable to purchase goods and services can involve an\nopportunity cost—a cost of the forgone opportunity of making a quick payment and benefiting from a cash\ndiscount. A business that does not take advantage of a cash discount for early payment of trade credit will pay\nmore for goods and services than a business that routinely takes advantage of discounts.\nThe annual percentage rate of forgoing quick payment discounts can be estimated with the following formula:\nExample: Novelty Accessories Inc. (NAI) purchases products from a vendor that offers credit payment terms of\n2/10, net 30. The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73\npercent.\n19.3\nCash Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why firms hold cash.\n•\nList instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.\nCash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows. To manage\ncash, the cash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected\nevents. Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than",

The establishment of and changes to credit terms are usually made in\nconsultation with the sales and financial management departments.\nMonitoring Accounts Receivables\nFinancial managers monitor accounts receivables using some basic tools. One of those tools is the accounts\nreceivable aging schedule (report). To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account\nbalances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.\nAn account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500\n($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.\n19.4 • Receivables Management\n581\nFigure 19.6 Foodinia Inc. Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender). Sometimes a company might request that a slow-paying customer sign a note",

Earlier in the\nchapter, the concept of the inventory conversion cycle was covered. The number of days that goods are held\nby a business is one of the focal points of inventory management.\nManagers look to minimize inventory balances and raise inventory turnover ratios while trying to balance the\nneeds of operations and sales. Purchasing personnel need to order enough inventory to “feed” production or\nto stock the shelves. The sales force wants to meet or surpass their sales budgets, and the operations people\nneed inventory for the factories, warehouses, and e-commerce sites.\nThe days in inventory ratio measures the average number of days between acquiring inventory (i.e.,\npurchasing merchandise) and its sale. This ratio is a metric to be watched and monitored by inventory\nmanagers and, if possible, minimized. A high days in inventory ratio could mean “aging” inventory. Old\ninventory could mean obsolesce or, in the case of perishable goods, spoilage. In either case, old inventory\nmeans losses.\nImagine a company selling high-tech products such as consumer electronics. A high days in inventory ratio\ncould mean that technologically obsolete products will be sold at a discount. There are similar issues with\nolder inventory in the fashion industry. Last year’s styles are not as appealing to the fashion-conscious\nconsumer and are usually sold at significant discounts. In the accounting world, lower of cost or market value\nis a test of inventory value to determine if inventory needs to be “written down,” meaning that the company\ntakes an expense for inventory that has lost significant value. Lower of cost or market is required by Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to state inventory valuations at realistic and conservative values.\nInventory is a very significant working capital component for many companies, such as manufacturers,\nwholesalers, and retailers. For those companies, inventory management involves management of the entire\nsupply chain: sourcing, storing, and selling inventory. At its very basic level, inventory management means\nhaving the right amount of stock at the right place and at the right time while also minimizing the cost of\ninventory. This concept is explained in the next section.\nInventory Cost\nControlling inventory costs minimizes working capital needs and, ultimately, the cost of goods sold. Inventory\nmanagement impacts profitability; minimizing cost of goods sold means maximizing gross profit (Gross Profit\n= Net Sales Less Cost of Goods Sold).\nThere are four components to inventory cost:\n•\nPurchasing costs: the invoice amount (after discounts) for inventory; the initial investment in inventory\n19.5 • Inventory Management\n583\n•\nCarrying costs: all costs of having inventory in stock, which includes storage costs (i.e., the cost of the\nspace to store the inventory, such as a warehouse), insurance, inventory obsolescence and spoilage, and\neven the opportunity cost of the investment in inventory\n•\nOrdering costs: the costs of placing an order with a vendor; the cost of a purchase and managing the\npayment process\n•\nStockout costs: an opportunity cost incurred when a customer order cannot be filled and the customer\ngoes elsewhere for the product; lost revenue",

A cash deficiency\nmeans that some type of financing, such as a line of credit or bank loan, will be needed to\nprovide enough cash for operations and to maintain a minimum cash balance. This number is\nfound by subtracting the minimum cash balance from the preliminary ending cash balance.\nFor example, the cash surplus for January in Figure 19.10 is calculated with this formula:\n=B6-B7. Notice that all months in the Sample Cash Budget show a surplus except for August’s\nforecast of a deficit, which may require drawing on a line of credit to provide enough cash to\nmeet obligations in August.\nTable 19.5 Excel Formulas for Monthly Cash Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n589\nSummary\n19.1 What Is Working Capital?\nWorking capital is not only necessary to run a business; it is a resource that will expand and contract with\nbusiness cycles and must be carefully managed and monitored. The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables. The credit managers’ mantra rings true: “The\nolder the receivable, the greater the likelihood that the account will not be collected.”\n19.5 Inventory Management\nInventory, usually the least liquid of the current assets, presents its own set of management challenges.\nFinding the optimal level of inventory is probably more of an art than a science. JIT helps to reduce the\ninvestment in inventory and lower the costs of storage, but stockout costs can be very damaging to\nprofitability.\n19.6 Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\nShort-term plans of a business are funded with cash, with cash budgets being a critical tool of planning. The\ncash budget takes into account a target amount of cash, factoring in all the motives for holding cash. A cash\nbudget looks ahead—predicting cash inflows and outflows, allocating for minimum cash balances to be\nmaintained, and helping management determine short-term financing needed. Although it is the last budget\nprepared, the preparation of the cash budget is an important financial planning exercise of companies small\nand large.\nKey Terms\naccounts receivable aging schedule\na report that shows amounts owed by customers by the age of the\naccount, as measured by the number of days since the sale\nallowance for doubtful accounts\nan account that contains the estimated amount of accounts receivable\nthat will not be collected\nbad debt expense\nan expense that a business incurs as a result of uncollectible accounts receivables\nbankruptcies\nfederal court procedures that protect distressed businesses from creditor collection efforts\nwhile allowing the debtor firm to liquidate its assets or devise a reorganization plan\n590\n19 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbenchmarking\nthe process of performance analysis that involves comparing financial condition and\noperating results against a standard, called a benchmark\nbill of lading\na document that is a detailed list of a goods that have been shipped; a receipt given by the\ncarrier (shipping company) to the seller as evidence that the goods have been shipped to the buyer\ncarrying costs\nall costs associated with having inventory in stock including storage costs, insurance,",

                    "question": "a. Jackson’s Moonshine LLC is most likely experiencing serious liquidity issues.",
                    "answer": "The liquidity ratio is a measure of a company's ability to pay off its short-term debt obligations with its short-term assets. A liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities. The higher the ratio, the better the company's liquidity. Jackson's Moonshine LLC has a current ratio of 1.25, which means that its current assets are 1.25 times its current liabilities. This is a relatively low ratio, which suggests that Jackson's Moonshine LLC may be experiencing some liquidity issues. However, it is important to note that this ratio alone does not provide a complete picture of a company's liquidity position. It is important to consider other factors, such as the company's cash flow and its ability to generate cash from operations, in order to get a more complete picture of a company's liquidity position."

The current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities. A current ratio of 1.25 indicates that Jackson's Moonshine LLC has $1.25 in current assets for every $1 in current liabilities. This is a relatively high current ratio, which suggests that Jackson's Moonshine LLC is not overinvested in marketable securities. In fact, the high current ratio suggests that Jackson's Moonshine LLC has a strong liquidity position and is well-positioned to meet its short-term obligations."

Rising costs could even cause the business to become unprofitable and close, causing\nmany employees to lose their jobs.

The three major areas of focus for the financial manager are the size, the timing, and the riskiness\nof the cash flows of the company. Broadly, the financial manager should work to\n•\nincrease cash coming into the company and decrease cash going out of the company;\n•\nspeed up cash coming into the company and slow down cash going out of the company; and\n•\ndecrease the riskiness of both money coming in and money going out of the company.\nThe first item in this list is obvious. The more revenue a company has, the more profitable it will be.\nBusinesspeople talk about “top line” growth when discussing this objective because revenue appears at the\ntop of the company’s income statement. Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book.

The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk. In 2020, corporations experienced an unprecedented risk\nbecause of COVID-19. Coffee shops were forced to remain closed as communities experienced government-\n3\nStarbucks.

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of\noperating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStarbucks\nThe most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on\nthe company’s investor relations website under the Financial Data section (https://openstax.org/r/\nFinancial_Data_section).

                    "answer": "The focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk occurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are generally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different points in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the bread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a bond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the future. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled."

Duration is an\nimportant measure of interest rate risk that incorporates the maturity and coupon rate of a bond as well as\nthe level of current market interest rates. Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of\nthis introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that\n•\nthe higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate\n9\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n615\nchanges;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.\nSwap-Based Hedging\nAs the name suggests, a swap involves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something. Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes\nup and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most\ncommonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can\nborrow money at rate equal to\n; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.\nIf the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLIBOR Transition\nAlthough the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial\ninstruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit the About LIBOR\nTransition (https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition) website.\nBeta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher\ninterest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit. Table 20.5\nsummarizes the situation and the rates at which Alpha and Beta can borrow. It also illustrates a way in which\nan interest rate swap can benefit both Alpha and Beta.\nAlpha\nBeta\nBond rating\nAAA\nBBB\nFloating rate\nFixed rate\n5\n6.75\nRate company chooses\nFixed at 5.0\nFloating at\nSwap\nN/A\nN/A\nBeta pays Alpha fixed rate\n5.5\n-5.5",

In essence, Beta is paying 5.5% to\nAlpha, 0.75% to its lender, and LIBOR to its lender.\nIn return, Alpha promises to pay Beta LIBOR. The exact amount that Alpha will pay to Beta fluctuates as LIBOR\nfluctuates. However, from Beta’s perspective, the payment of LIBOR it receives from Alpha exactly offsets the\npayment of LIBOR it makes to its lender. When LIBOR increases, the rate of\nthat Beta is\npaying to its lender increases, but the LIBOR rate it receives from Alpha also increases. When LIBOR decreases,\nBeta receives less from Alpha, but it also pays less to its lender. Because the LIBOR it receives from Alpha is\nexactly equal to the LIBOR it pays to its lender, Beta’s net amount of interest paid is 6.25%—the 5.5% it pays to\nAlpha plus the 0.75% it pays to its lender.\nAlpha is in the position of paying 5.0% to its lender and LIBOR to Beta while receiving 5.5% from Beta.

It would have cost Alpha\nto borrow the money from its lenders at a variable rate.\nBy participating in this swap arrangement, Alpha has been able to lower its interest rate by 0.75%.\nThrough this swap arrangement, Beta has been able to fix its interest rate at 6.25% rather than having a\nvariable rate. This predictability is a benefit for a company, especially one that is in a bit more precarious\nposition as far as its creditworthiness and stability. The 6.25% Beta pays as a result of this arrangement is 0.5%\nbelow the 6.75% it would have paid if it simply borrowed from its lenders at a fixed rate.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n617\nSummary\n20.1 The Importance of Risk Management\nRisk arises due to uncertainty. The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has",
