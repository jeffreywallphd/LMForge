This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1.

Black’s Law Dictionary says that law is “a \nbody of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force. That \nwhich must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1] \n \nFunctions of the Law \nIn a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual \nrights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly \nsocial change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \nauthoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \nor political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism, \nEuropean nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \nthose same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by \nSpain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and",

Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or",

There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality?

In \nEngland, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision. They often \nresorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way. This is essentially reasoning by analogy.

The law establishes a moral minimum and does so especially in the area of criminal laws; if you \nbreak a criminal law, you can lose your freedom (in jail) or your life (if you are convicted of a capital \noffense). In a civil action, you would not be sent to prison; in the worst case, you can lose property \n(usually money or other assets), such as when Ford Motor Company lost a personal injury case and the \njudge awarded $295 million to the plaintiffs or when Pennzoil won a $10.54 billion verdict against Texaco \n(see Chapter 7 \"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nSome of the basic differences between civil law and criminal law cases are illustrated in Table 1.1 \n\"Differences between Civil and Criminal Cases\". \n \n \nTable 1.1 Differences between Civil and Criminal Cases \n \n \nCivil Cases \nCriminal Cases \nParties \nPlaintiff brings case; defendant must answer or lose \nby default \nProsecutor brings case; defendant may \nremain silent \nProof \nPreponderance of evidence \nBeyond a reasonable doubt \nReason \nTo settle disputes peacefully, usually between \nprivate parties \nTo maintain order in society \n \n \nTo punish the most blameworthy \n \n \nTo deter serious wrongdoing \nRemedies Money damages (legal remedy) \nFines, jail, and forfeitures \n \nInjunctions (equitable remedy) \n \n \nSpecific performance (equity) \n \n \nRegarding plaintiffs and prosecutors, you can often tell a civil case from a criminal case by looking at the \ncaption of a case going to trial.

The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee.

By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery.

Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwould override previous federal or state statutes. \n \nOne example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-\ndolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico.

In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective.

This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process.

This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n26 \nthat the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use \nto him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him. \n \nAn old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis \nnon curat lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action.

The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, \nadopting the report and recommendation of the Magistrate, found this to be “a close case,” but held \nthat Hardy’s conduct did not create an abusive environment. The court found that some of Hardy’s \ncomments “offended [Harris], and would offend the reasonable woman,” but that they were not “so \nsevere as to be expected to seriously affect [Harris’s] psychological well-being. A reasonable woman \nmanager under like circumstances would have been offended by Hardy, but his conduct would not \nhave risen to the level of interfering with that person’s work performance. \n \n“Neither do I believe that [Harris] was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury.…Although \nHardy may at times have genuinely offended [Harris], I do not believe that he created a working \nenvironment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to [Harris].” \n \nIn focusing on the employee’s psychological well-being, the District Court was following Circuit \nprecedent.

For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so.

A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy.

They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring.

Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do.",

If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news.

Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response.

If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers",

New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms.

Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality.

This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier.

First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states.

Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior to any trial. \n2. Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial. \n \n \nThe early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex \nprocess of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A lawsuit will start \nwith the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the \ndefendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim). After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge. Motions in the \nearly stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to \ncompel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process. \n \nInitial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss \nThe first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings. These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail. Cases can be decided \non the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the \ncourt can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks.

(2) The defendant can move to \ndismiss the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to “state a claim on which relief can be \ngranted,” or on the basis that there is no subject matter jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, \nor on the basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is saying, in effect, \nthat even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by \nthe court. For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-\ncalled alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will \ndismiss the complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a \ndemurrer.) \n \nA third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment.

A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years.

These challenges are typically limited in number and are often used to remove potential jurors who may be biased or have a personal connection to the case. Some of the peremptory challenges that most states (and the federal system) allow include challenges for cause, which are challenges based on a specific reason such as a potential juror's relationship to one of the parties involved in the case, and peremptory challenges, which are challenges that can be used without having to provide a reason. The specific rules and limitations on the use of peremptory challenges can vary by state and federal court."

The judge will carefully determine which instructions to give and often will \nuse a set of pattern instructions provided by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state. \nThese pattern jury instructions are often safer because they are patterned after language that appellate \ncourts have used previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible error in the instructions. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n115 \nAfter all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a private room and discuss the case and the answers \nrequested by the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict. Some minor cases do not \nrequire a unanimous verdict. If the jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the case \nwill have to be retried. When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their \nlawyers present. The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge. (If there is no \njury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to \nthose facts. Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is. If it is favorable to the \nparty the judge thinks should win, she can rely on that verdict. If the verdict is for the other party, he can \ngrant the motion for judgment n.o.v. This is a safer way to proceed because if the judge is reversed on \nappeal, a new trial is not necessary. The jury’s verdict always can be restored, whereas without a jury \nverdict (as happens when a directed verdict is granted before the case goes to the jury), the entire case \nmust be presented to a new jury.

Understand the posttrial process—how appellate courts process appeals. \n2. Explain how a court’s judgment is translated into relief for the winning party. \n \n \nJudgment or Order \nAt the end of a trial, the judge will enter an order that makes findings of fact (often with the help of a jury) \nand conclusions of law. The judge will also make a judgment as to what relief or remedy should be given. \nOften it is an award of money damages to one of the parties. The losing party may ask for a new trial at \nthis point or within a short period of time following. Once the trial judge denies any such request, the \njudgment—in the form of the court’s order—is final. \n \nAppeal \nIf the loser’s motion for a new trial or a judgment n.o.v. is denied, the losing party may appeal but must \nordinarily post a bond sufficient to ensure that there are funds to pay the amount awarded to the winning \nparty. In an appeal, the appellant aims to show that there was some prejudicial error committed by the \ntrial judge. There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic \nidea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides. Enforcement \nof the court’s judgment—an award of money, an injunction—is usually stayed (postponed) until the \nappellate court has ruled. As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the \nparty defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent). \n \nDuring the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge. In \ncompiling a record on appeal, the appellant needs to show the appellate court some examples of mistakes \nmade by the judge—for example, having erroneously admitted evidence, having failed to admit proper \nevidence that should have been admitted, or having wrongly instructed the jury. The appellate court must \ndetermine if those mistakes were serious enough to amount to prejudicial error. \n \nAppellate and trial procedures are different. The appellate court does not hear witnesses or accept \nevidence. It reviews the record of the case—the transcript of the witnesses’ testimony and the documents",

Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts. \n2. Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n121 \n \n \nAlmost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney. But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue?

Understand the various ways that lawyers charge for services. \n2. Describe the contingent fee system in the United States. \n3. Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n \nLegal Fees \nLawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. \nA flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance \napproximately how long it will take her to do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are \nexamples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the \nworth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price. \n \nLawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial \nmatters. Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range \nfrom $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time. \n \nA contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the \nsuccess of the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., \nautomobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite often, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n125 \ncontingent fee is controversial. Trial lawyers justify it by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such \nlawsuits. A typical automobile accident case can cost at least ten thousand dollars to prepare, and a \ncomplicated products-liability case can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Few people have that kind of \nmoney or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit. Corporate and \nprofessional defendants complain that the contingent fee gives lawyers a license to go big game hunting, \nor to file suits against those with deep pockets in the hopes of forcing them to settle. \n \nTrial lawyers respond that the contingent fee arrangement forces them to screen cases and weed out cases",

The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch.

Distinguish between “discrimination” dormant-commerce-clause cases and “undue burden” dormant-\ncommerce-clause cases. \n \n \nCongress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause and often does legislate. For example, \nCongress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in \nlength. But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and \nlength of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules. States may do so under the so-\ncalled historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government. \nThese police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, \nmorals, and the environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when \nstate action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate. This power is \nclaimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause. \n \nThere are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an \n“undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be \nstruck down. Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 \"Summary and Exercises\", is an example \nof a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on \nits highways.

A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner \ntest than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to \nsubstantially relate to important government objectives.

We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The \nrecord demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the \napple trade. [The record] contains numerous affidavits [stating a] preference [for] apples graded under \nthe Washington, as opposed to the USDA, system because of the former’s greater consistency, its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n189 \nemphasis on color, and its supporting mandatory inspections. Once again, the statute had no similar \nimpact on the North Carolina apple industry and thus operated to its benefit. \n \nThird, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, \nthe statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers. \n[With] free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage \nvis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior.

This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784.

Political speech is so ingrained in our \nculture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws.

Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and \ninformative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment \nrights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted \nmessages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic \nviews. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to \npoint out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials. \n \nRapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression—\ncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. \nToday, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. Soon, \nhowever, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide \ncitizens with significant information about political candidates and issues.

The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions \nbased on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech. \n \nDue consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is overruled.

Explain the need for the Freedom of Information Act and how it works in the US legal system. \n \n \nThe Paperwork Burden \nThe administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes. As long as each company engages in a single line of \nbusiness, data are comparable. When the era of conglomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent",

For many years, the \ngovernment insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a \nwarrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an \nunderage patron to the store). Or a junkyard that specializes in automobiles and automobile parts may \nalso be subject to surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly likely to be active in the \nresale of stolen autos or stolen auto parts. [3] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n221 \n \nIt is also possible for inspections to take place without a search warrant and without the permission of the \nbusiness. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wished to inspect parts of the Dow \nChemical facility in Midland, Michigan, without the benefit of warrant. When they were refused, agents of \nthe EPA obtained a fairly advanced aerial mapping camera and rented an airplane to fly over the Dow \nfacility. Dow went to court for a restraining order against the EPA and a request to have the EPA turn over \nall photographs taken. But the Supreme Court ruled that the areas photographed were “open fields” and \nnot subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment.

(The act was amended in 1974 and again in 1976 to overcome a tendency of \nmany agencies to stall or refuse access to their files.) Under the FOIA, any person has a legally enforceable \nright of access to all government documents, with nine specific exceptions, such as classified military \nintelligence, medical files, and trade secrets and commercial or financial information if “obtained from a \nperson and privileged or confidential.” Without the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions,",

Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal.

A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car. If the finance company repossesses the car, the \ncustomer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have \ntaken the new car by larceny or embezzlement. Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the \ndealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying.

Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who \nuses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be \nconvicted under the law. In one case, a state governor was convicted of mail fraud when he took bribes to \ninfluence the setting of racing dates. The court’s theory was that he defrauded the citizenry of its right to \nhis “honest and faithful services” as governor.

For example, \nin a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a \nuse that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

[2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation.

Under certain circumstances, however, ignorance of law will be excused. If a statute imposes \ncriminal penalties for an action taken without a license, and if the government official responsible for \nissuing the license formally tells you that you do not need one (though in fact you do), a conviction for \nviolating the statute cannot stand.

Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence. \n \n \nSearch and Seizure \nThe rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that \nmake up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.

In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies. Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors. Most people have a \ngeneral notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft. But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act. It is usually easier to convict someone of attempt or conspiracy than to convict for the main \ncrime, and a person involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony may find that very little is required to put \nhim into serious trouble.",

Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states",

Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still another excuse is consent: two \nboxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear). \n \nDamages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n286 \nSince the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually \nmeasured by the extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations.

Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment. The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any \nstatements made in connection with legislative business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third \nperson, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the \nwarning, even though false. Likewise, an employee may warn an employer about the conduct or character \nof a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence \nor conduct of a child’s teacher. There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant with nothing but an \nidle interest in the matter (an “officious intermeddler”) must take the risk that his information is wrong. \n \nIn 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding \nthat under the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public official against a newspaper cannot \nstand unless the plaintiff has shown “actual malice,” which in turn was defined as “knowledge that [the \nstatement] was false or with a reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”[4] In subsequent cases, the \ncourt extended the constitutional doctrine further, applying it not merely to government officials but \nto public figures, people who voluntarily place themselves in the public eye or who involuntarily find",

Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot?

(Answer: in most cases, yes.) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n299 \nDespite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable man is one on which most negligence cases \nultimately turn. If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed \nan unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most \ninstances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do. The reasonable man stops for \ntraffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs \nsurgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of \nhis grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions \nto avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The \"reasonable man\" standard imposes hindsight \non the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may \nsometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable. \n \nDuty of Care and Its Breach \nThe law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person. If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in \nthis interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might \nsubject us to liability for its effect on someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the \nnumber of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful. \n \nIn general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the \ndrowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase. For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold.",

In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the \nlaw has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active \nmisconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps \nto protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373. Liability for nonfeasance was slow to \nreceive recognition in the law. “The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by \n‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has \nat least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his \naffairs.” Id.

Such special relationships are \npredicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies \nthe imposition of a duty to act.” W.

According to the \nevidence, there are only two possible sources of a special relationship out of which such a duty could arise \nin this case: the status of Whitlock as a student at the University, and the lease between the University and \nthe fraternity of which Whitlock was a member. We first consider the adequacy of the student-university \nrelationship as a possible basis for imposing a duty on the University to control or prohibit the use of the \ntrampoline, and then examine the provisions of the lease for that same purpose. \n \nA. \nThe student-university relationship has been scrutinized in several jurisdictions, and it is generally agreed \nthat a university is not an insurer of its students’ safety.

The argument in essence is that a duty should spring from the University’s natural interest \nin the welfare and safety of its students, its superior knowledge of the nature and degree of risk involved \nin trampoline use, and its knowledge of the use of trampolines on the University campus. The evidence \namply supports a conclusion that trampoline use involves risks of serious injuries and that the potential \nfor an injury such as that experienced by Whitlock was foreseeable. It shows further that prior injuries \nresulting from trampoline accidents had been reported to campus security and to the student clinic, and \nthat University administrators were aware of the number and severity of trampoline injuries nationwide. \n \nThe record, however, also establishes through Whitlock’s own testimony that he was aware of the risk of \nan accident and injury of the very nature that he experienced.… \n \nWe conclude that the relationship between the University and Whitlock was not one of dependence with \nrespect to the activities at issue here, and provides no basis for the recognition of a duty of the University \nto take measures for protection of Whitlock against the injury that he suffered. \n \nB. \nWe next examine the lease between the University and the fraternity to determine whether a special \nrelationship between the University and Whitlock can be predicated on that document.

Tort law has had a significant impact on business because modern \ntechnology poses significant dangers and the modern market is so efficient at distributing goods to a wide \nclass of consumers. \n \nUnlike criminal law, tort law does not require the tortfeasor to have a specific intent to commit the act for \nwhich he or she will be held liable to pay damages. Negligence—that is, carelessness—is a major factor in \ntort liability. In some instances, especially in cases involving injuries caused by products, a no-fault \nstandard called strict liability is applied. \n \nWhat constitutes a legal injury depends very much on the circumstances. A person can assume a risk or \nconsent to the particular action, thus relieving the person doing the injury from tort liability. To be liable, \nthe tortfeasor must be the proximate cause of the injury, not a remote cause. On the other hand, certain \npeople are held to answer for the torts of another—for example, an employer is usually liable for the torts \nof his employees, and a bartender might be liable for injuries caused by someone to whom he sold too \nmany drinks. Two types of statutes—workers’ compensation and no-fault automobile insurance—have \neliminated tort liability for certain kinds of accidents and replaced it with an immediate insurance \npayment plan. \n \nAmong the torts of particular importance to the business community are wrongful death and personal \ninjury caused by products or acts of employees, misrepresentation, defamation, and interference with \ncontractual relations. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n325 \n1.

Tort duties, in contrast, are \nobligations the law imposes. Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an \nunderstanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.1 General Perspectives on Contracts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the role of contract in society: it moves society from status to contract. \n2. Know the definition of a contract. \n3. Recognize the sources of contract law: the common law, the UCC, and the Convention on the International \nSale of Goods—a treaty (the CISG). \n4. Understand some fundamental contract taxonomy and terminology. \n \n \nThe Role of Contract in Society \nContract is probably the most familiar legal concept in our society because it is so central to a deeply held \nconviction about the essence of our political, economic, and social life. In common parlance, the term is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n329 \nused interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies \nour notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a \nnineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law. As he \nput it: \n \n(F)rom a condition of society in which all the relations of Persons are summed up in the relations",

Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law.

A \nrevision—the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979. \nThe Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, \nrestitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field. These analyses are \nmade with an eye to discerning the various principles that have emerged from the courts, and to the \nmaximum extent possible, the Restatements declare the law as the courts have determined it to be. The \nRestatements, guided by a Reporter (the director of the project) and a staff of legal scholars, go through \nseveral so-called “tentative” drafts—sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty—and are screened by various \ncommittees within the American Law Institute before they are eventually published as final documents. \n \nThe Restatement of Contracts won prompt respect in the courts and has been cited in innumerable cases. \nThe Restatements are not authoritative, in the sense that they are not actual judicial precedents, but they \nare nevertheless weighty interpretive texts, and judges frequently look to them for guidance.

Two years later, in 1974, \nLouisiana made the UCC a truly national law when it enacted some but not all of the 1972 text \n(significantly, Louisiana has not adopted Article 2).

This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity.

However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet \nof one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods. The Code deals with phases of this \ntransaction from start to finish. These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: \n \n• \nSales (Article 2) \n• \nCommercial Paper (Article 3) \n• \nBank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) \n• \nLetters of Credit (Article 5) \n• \nBulk Transfers (Article 6) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n334 \n• \nWarehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) \n• \nInvestment Securities (Article 8) \n• \nSecured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) \n \nWe now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction. \nSales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined \n(Section 2-105) in part as “all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for",

For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract.

Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you. \nA voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing.

(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES",

Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an \nincentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay.

Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady. But Alden was so tongue-tied that his vaunted eloquence fell short, turned Priscilla cold toward \nthe object of Alden’s mission, and eventually led her to turn the tables in one of the most famous lines in \nAmerican literature and poetry: “Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?” John eventually did: the two \nwere married in 1623 in Plymouth. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency \nLet’s analyze this sequence of events in legal terms—recognizing, of course, that this example is an \nanalogy and that the law, even today, would not impose consequences on Alden for his failure to carry out \nCaptain Standish’s wishes. Alden was the captain’s agent: he was specifically authorized to speak in his \nname in a manner agreed on, toward a specified end, and he accepted the assignment in consideration of \nthe captain’s friendship. He had, however, a conflict of interest. He attempted to carry out the assignment, \nbut he did not perform according to expectations. Eventually, he wound up with the prize himself. Here \nare some questions to consider, the same questions that will recur throughout the discussion of agency: \n \n• \nHow extensive was John’s authority? Could he have made promises to Priscilla on the captain’s \nbehalf—for example, that Standish would have built her a fine house? \n• \nCould he, if he committed a tort, have imposed liability on his principal? Suppose, for example, \nthat he had ridden at breakneck speed to reach Priscilla’s side and while en route ran into and \ninjured a pedestrian on the road. Could the pedestrian have sued Standish? \n• \nSuppose Alden had injured himself on the journey. Would Standish be liable to Alden? \n• \nIs Alden liable to Standish for stealing the heart of Priscilla—that is, for taking the “profits” of the \nenterprise for himself? \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n373 \nAs these questions suggest, agency law often involves three parties—the principal, the agent, and a third \nparty.

In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer",

As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant.

It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability.

The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent? \n4. Why were workers’ compensation statutes adopted in the early twentieth century?",

Microsoft Corp. \n97 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir. 1996) \n \nReinhardt, J. \n \nLarge corporations have increasingly adopted the practice of hiring temporary employees or \nindependent contractors as a means of avoiding payment of employee benefits, and thereby increasing \ntheir profits. This practice has understandably led to a number of problems, legal and otherwise. One of \nthe legal issues that sometimes arises is exemplified by this lawsuit. The named plaintiffs, who were \nclassified by Microsoft as independent contractors, seek to strip that label of its protective covering and \nto obtain for themselves certain benefits that the company provided to all of its regular or permanent \nemployees. After certifying the named plaintiffs as representatives of a class of “common-law \nemployees,” the district court granted summary judgment to Microsoft on all counts. The \nplaintiffs…now appeal as to two of their claims: a) the claim…that they are entitled to savings benefits \nunder Microsoft’s Savings Plus Plan (SPP); and b) that…they are entitled to stock-option benefits under \nMicrosoft’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). In both cases, the claims are based on their \ncontention that they are common-law employees. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n399 \nMicrosoft, one of the country’s fastest growing and most successful corporations and the world’s largest \nsoftware company, produces and sells computer software internationally. It employs a core staff of \npermanent employees. It categorizes them as “regular employees” and offers them a wide variety of \nbenefits, including paid vacations, sick leave, holidays, short-term disability, group health and life \ninsurance, and pensions, as well as the two benefits involved in this appeal.

The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument.

They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus.

There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights. It is “well established” that an optionor may not rely on an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n403 \noptionee’s failure to exercise an option when he has committed any act or failed to perform any duty \n“calculated to cause the optionee to delay in exercising the right.” [Citation] “[T]he optionor may not \nmake statements or representations calculated to cause delay, [or] fail to furnish [necessary] \ninformation.…” Similarly, “[I]t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause \nof the failure of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own \nliability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.” [Citation]… \n \nApplying these principles, we agree with the magistrate judge, who concluded that Microsoft, which \ncreated a benefit to which the plaintiffs were entitled, could not defend itself by arguing that the plaintiffs \nwere unaware of the benefit, when its own false representations precluded them from gaining that \nknowledge.

The determinative factor is the particular vulnerability of an individual \nby virtue of his physical makeup.

To ratify, the principal may \ntell the parties concerned or by his conduct manifest that he is willing to accept the results as though the \nact were authorized. Or by his silence he may find under certain circumstances that he has ratified. Note \nthat ratification does not require the usual consideration of contract law. The principal need be promised \nnothing extra for his decision to affirm to be binding on him. Nor does ratification depend on the position \nof the third party; for example, a loss stemming from his reliance on the agent’s representations is not \nrequired.

If the principal directed the agent to commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the \nagent’s carrying out his instructions would bring harm to someone, the principal is liable. This is an \napplication of the general common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by delegating an \nunlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls \nthe trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in his use of agents will be held liable for their \nnegligence. This rule comes into play when the principal fails to supervise employees adequately, gives \nfaulty directions, or hires incompetent or unsuitable people for a particular job. Imposing liability on the \nprincipal in these cases is readily justifiable since it is the principal’s own conduct that is the underlying \nfault; the principal here is directly liable. \n \nVicarious Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n424 \nBut the principle of liability for one’s agent is much broader, extending to acts of which the principal had \nno knowledge, that he had no intention to commit nor involvement in, and that he may in fact have \nexpressly prohibited the agent from engaging in. This is the principle of respondeat superior (“let the \nmaster answer”) or the master-servant doctrine, which imposes on the \nprincipal vicarious liability (vicarious means “indirectly, as, by, or through a substitute”) under which \nthe principal is responsible for acts committed by the agent within the scope of the employment \n(see Figure 10.2 \"Principal’s Tort Liability\"). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10.2 Principal’s Tort Liability \n \n \nThe modern basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed the “deep pocket” theory: the principal \n(usually a corporation) has deeper pockets than the agent, meaning that it has the wherewithal to pay for",

Generally, these exceptions \nfall into a category of duties that the law deems nondelegable. In some situations, one person is obligated \nto provide protection to or care for another. The failure to do so results in liability whether or not the \nharm befell the other because of an independent contractor’s wrongdoing. Thus a homeowner has a duty \nto ensure that physical conditions in and around the home are not unreasonably dangerous.

The thought was that one could never infer authority to \ncommit a willfully wrongful act. Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal if the \nagent is acting to further the principal’s business. See the very disturbing Lyon v. Carey in Section 10.4.2 \n\"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: Scope of Employment\". \nDeviations from Employment \nThe general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if the servant committed them “in the scope of \nemployment.” But determining what this means is not easy. \n \nThe “Scope of Employment” Problem \nIt may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent of another. But a principal cannot be \nresponsible for every act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of his instructions, it will be \neasy to determine liability. But suppose an agent deviates in some way from his job. The classic test of \nliability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison.

The office manager came into the \nroom, saw the clerk counting the pennies, became enraged at the situation, shoved the pennies onto the \nfloor and ordered Munick to pick them up. Bolton, the manager, “locked the front door and took me by \nthe jacket and called me ‘God damned Jew,’ and said, ‘I want only bills.’ I did not say anything and he hit \nme in the face. I did not resist, and the door was locked and I could not get out.…” With the door locked, \nBolton then repeatedly choked and beat the plaintiff, finally extracted a bill in place of the pennies, and \nordered him off the premises with injuries including finger marks on his neck that could be seen for eight \nor ten days.

Officer James then transported Cockrell to the Reservoir Patrol office \nand administered an intoxilyzer test. The results of the test are not before us; however, we do know that \nafter the test was administered, Officer James apologized to Cockrell for arresting her, and he assured her \nthat he would prepare her paperwork so that she would not have to spend much time in jail. As they were \nleaving the Reservoir Patrol office, Officer James began asking Cockrell personal questions such as where \nshe lived, whether she was dating anyone and if she had a boyfriend. Officer James then asked Cockrell \nfor her cell phone number so that he could call and check on her. As they were approaching his patrol car \nfor the trip to the Rankin County jail, Officer James informed Cockrell that she should be wearing \nhandcuffs; however, he did not handcuff Cockrell, and he allowed her to ride in the front seat of the patrol \ncar with him. In route to the jail, Cockrell became emotional and started crying. As she was fixing her \nmakeup using the mirror on the sun visor, Officer James pulled his patrol car into a church parking lot \nand parked the car. He then pulled Cockrell towards him in an embrace and began stroking her back and \nhair telling her that things would be fine. Cockrell told Officer James to release her, but he continued to \nembrace her for approximately five minutes before continuing on to the jail. \n \nOn June 30, 1998, Cockrell returned to the Reservoir Patrol office to retrieve her driver’s license. Officer \nJames called Cockrell into his office and discussed her DUI charge with her. As she was leaving, Officer \nJames grabbed her from behind, turned her around, pinned both of her arms behind her and pulled her to \nhis chest. When Officer James bent down to kiss her, she ducked her head, thus causing Officer James to \ninstead kiss her forehead.

Similarly, to sue a partnership, the plaintiff must name and sue each of the \npartners. This cumbersome procedure was modified in many states, which enacted special statutes \nexpressly permitting suits by and against partnerships in the firm name. In suits on a claim in federal \ncourt, a partnership may sue and be sued in its common name. The move by RUPA to make partnerships \nentities changed very little. Certainly it provides that “a partnership may sue and be sued in the name of \nthe partnership”—that’s handy where the plaintiff hopes for a judgment against the partnership, without \nrecourse to the individual partners’ personal assets. [6] But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and \nthe partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment \nagainst a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating \nthat partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in \npartnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership. [8] Under RUPA, \n“property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.” [9] But RUPA \nis no different from UPA in practical effect.

Under \nneither law can a partner unilaterally dispose of partnership property, however labeled, for the obvious \nreason that one cannot dispose of another’s property or property rights without permission.

The partnership cannot discharge its debts in a liquidation proceeding under \nChapter 7 of the bankruptcy law, but it can be rehabilitated under Chapter 11 (see Chapter 27 \n\"Bankruptcy\"). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nPartnership law is very important because it is the way most small businesses are organized and because it is \npossible for a person to become a partner without intending to. Partnership law goes back a long way, but in \nthe United States, most states—but not all—have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA, 1997) \nover the previous Uniform Partnership Act, originally promulgated in 1914. One salient change made by RUPA \nis to directly announce that a partnership is an entity: it is like a person for purposes of accounting, litigation, \nbankruptcy, and owning real estate. Partnerships do not pay taxes; the individual partners do. But in practical \nterms, what RUPA does is codify already-existing state law on these matters, and partners are free to organize \ntheir relationship as they like in the partnership agreement. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

[1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to \ncomply with the statute, it could find that it will be unable to file suit to enforce its contracts. \nCreation of Implied Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n466 \nAn implied partnership exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on a business as co-\nowners for profit.

Obviously, we know if there is an \nexpress agreement. But partnerships can come into existence quite informally, indeed, without any \nformality—they can be created accidentally. In contrast to the corporation, which is the creature of \nstatute, partnership is a catchall term for a large variety of working relationships, and frequently, \nuncertainties arise about whether or not a particular relationship is that of partnership. The law can \nreduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price of severely restricting the flexibility of people to \nassociate. As the chief drafter of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA, 1914) explained, \n \nAll other business associations are statutory in origin. They are formed by the happening of an \nevent designated in a statute as necessary to their formation. In corporations this act may be the \nissuing of a charter by the proper officer of the state; in limited partnerships, the filing by the \nassociates of a specified document in a public office.

Liability of Purported Partner. \n \n(a) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented \nby another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the \npurported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, \nrelying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. \n \nPartnership by estoppel has two elements: (1) a representation to a third party that there is in fact a \npartnership and (2) reliance by the third party on the representation. See Section 11.3.3 \"Partnership by \nEstoppel\", Chavers v. Epsco, Inc., for an example of partnership by estoppel. \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA partnership is any two or more persons—including corporate persons—carrying on a business as co-owners \nfor profit. A primary test of whether a partnership exists is whether there is a sharing of profits, though other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n471 \nfactors such as sharing decision making, sharing liabilities, and how the business is operated are also \nexamined. \nMost partnerships are expressly created. Several factors become important in the partnership agreement, \nwhether written or oral. These include the name of the business, the capital contributions of each partner, \nprofit sharing, and decision making. But a partnership can also arise by implication or by estoppel, where one \nhas held herself as a partner and another has relied on that representation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Employment Security Commission \n274 A.2d 707 (Del. 1971) \n \nSTOREY, J. \n \nThe Employment Security Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, levied an involuntary \nassessment against Richard K. Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important. Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade.

The third \nparagraph declared that the income of the partnership would be divided 30% for Chaiken, 70% for \nStrazella; 20% for Chaiken and 80% for Spitzer. The fourth paragraph declared that all partnership policy \nwould be decided by Chaiken, whose decision was final. The fifth paragraph forbade assignment of the \nagreement without permission of Chaiken. The sixth paragraph required Chaiken to hold and distribute \nall receipts. The final paragraph stated hours of work for Strazella and Spitzer and holidays. \n \nThe mere existence of an agreement labeled “partnership” agreement and the characterization of \nsignatories as “partners” docs not conclusively prove the existence of a partnership. Rather, the intention \nof the parties, as explained by the wording of the agreement, is paramount. \n \nA partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for \nprofit. As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept. Co-owners should also contribute valuable consideration \nfor the creation of the business. Under paragraph two, however, Chaiken provides the barber chair (and \nimplicitly the barber shop itself), mirror, licenses and linen, while the other partners merely provide their \ntools and labor—nothing more than any barber-employee would furnish. Standing alone, however, mere \ncontribution of work and skill can be valuable consideration for a partnership agreement. \n \nPartnership interests may be assignable, although it is not a violation of partnership law to prohibit \nassignment in a partnership agreement.

But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business.

Partnership law defines a partnership as “an \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.” The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) assumes that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals, but it also applies a \nnumber of rules characteristic of the legal entity theory. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) \nassumes a partnership is an entity, but it applies one crucial rule characteristic of the aggregate theory: \nthe partners are ultimately liable for the partnership’s obligations. Thus a partnership may keep business \nrecords as if it were a legal entity, may hold real estate in the partnership name, and may sue and be sued \nin federal court and in many state courts in the partnership name. \n \nPartnerships may be created informally. Among the clues to the existence of a partnership are (1) co-\nownership of a business, (2) sharing of profits, (3) right to participate in decision making, (4) duty to \nshare liabilities, and (5) manner in which the business is operated. A partnership may also be formed by \nimplication; it may be formed by estoppel when a third party reasonably relies on a representation that a \npartnership in fact exists. \nNo special rules govern the partnership agreement. As a practical matter, it should sufficiently spell out \nwho the partners are, under what name they will conduct their business, the nature and scope of the \nbusiness, capital contributions of each partner, how profits are to be divided, and similar pertinent \nprovisions. An oral agreement to form a partnership is valid unless the business cannot be performed \nwholly within one year from the time that the agreement is made. However, most partnerships have no \nfixed terms and hence are “at-will” partnerships not subject to the Statute of Frauds. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n488",

                    "answer": "A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit. A corporation is a legal entity created by state statute that has the rights of a person, including the right to sue and be sued. It is created by filing articles of incorporation with the secretary of state. The owners of a corporation are called shareholders."

Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404.

So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of \nother partners’ successes (and pay for their failures too). A person working for the firm who is not a \npartner is an associate and usually only gets only a salary. \n \nRight to Indemnification \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n497 \nA partner who incurs liabilities in the normal course of business or to preserve its business or property is \nentitled to indemnification (UPA Section 18(b), RUPA Section 401(c)).

As spelled out in Section 25(2), the specific property interest of a tenant in \npartnership vests in the surviving partners, not in the heirs. But the heirs are entitled to the deceased \npartner’s interest in the partnership itself, so that while Baker and Carr may use the partnership property \nfor the benefit of the partnership without consulting Able’s heirs, they must account to her heirs for her \nproper share of the partnership’s profits. \n \n \n \nRights in Specific Property: RUPA Approach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n499",

The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights.

Professor \nSamuelson calls to mind the example of William Dean Howells’s Silas Lapham, who forces his partner to \nsell out by offering him an ultimatum: “You may buy me out or I’ll buy you out.” The ultimatum was given \nat a time when the partner could not afford to buy Lapham out, so the partner had no choice. \n \nIn Violation of the Agreement \nDissolution may also result from violation of the agreement, as when the partners decide to discharge a \npartner though no provision permits them to do so, or as when a partner decides to quit in violation of a \nterm agreement. In the former case, the remaining partners are liable for damages for wrongful \ndissolution, and in the latter case, the withdrawing partner is liable to the remaining partners the same \nway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n513 \n \nBy Operation of Law \nA third reason for dissolution is the occurrence of some event, such as enactment of a statute, that makes \nit unlawful to continue the business.

[3] \n \nBy Court Order \nFinally, dissolution may be by court order. Courts are empowered to dissolve partnerships when “on \napplication by or for a partner” a partner is shown to be a lunatic, of unsound mind, incapable of \nperforming his part of the agreement, “guilty of such conduct as tends to affect prejudicially the carrying \non of the business,” or otherwise behaves in such a way that “it is not reasonably practicable to carry on \nthe business in partnership with him.” A court may also order dissolution if the business can only be \ncarried on at a loss or whenever equitable. In some circumstances, a court will order dissolution upon the \napplication of a purchaser of a partner’s interest. [4] \n \nEffect of Dissolution on Authority \nFor the most part, dissolution terminates the authority of the partners to act for the partnership. The only \nsignificant exceptions are for acts necessary to wind up partnership affairs or to complete transactions \nbegun but not finished at the time of dissolution.

The policies should bear a face amount equal to each partner’s interest in the partnership and \nshould be adjusted as the fortunes of the partnership change.

In any event, common agreement formats for dissolution will provide for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n519 \nbuilt-in dispute resolution, and enlightened partners often agree to such mechanisms in advance to \navoid the kinds of problems listed here. \n• \nAny partnership will dissolve upon the happening of an event the partners specified would cause \ndissolution in their agreement. They may change their minds, of course, agree to continue, and amend \nthe partnership agreement accordingly. \n• \nA term partnership may be dissolved before its term expires in three ways. First, if a partner \ndissociated by death, declaring bankruptcy, becoming incapacitated, or wrongfully dissociates, the \npartnership will dissolve if within ninety days of that triggering dissociation at least half the \nremaining partners express their will to wind it up. Second, the partnership may be dissolved if the \nterm expires. Third, it may be dissolved if all the partners agree to amend the partnership agreement \nby expressly agreeing to dissolve. \n \n(2) Dissolution will happen in some cases by operation of law if it becomes illegal to continue the \nbusiness, or substantially all of it. For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable.

We reject its argument. \n \nSouthern Oaks argues Horizon wrongfully caused the dissolution because the basis for dissolution cited \nby the court is not one of the grounds for which the parties contracted. The pertinent contracts provided \nin section 7.3 “Causes of Dissolution”: “In addition to the causes for dissolution set forth in Section 7.2(c), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n539 \nthe Partnership shall be dissolved in the event that:…(d) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the \nother Partner, either Partner elects to dissolve the Partnership on account of an Irreconcilable Difference \nwhich arises and cannot, after good faith efforts, be resolved.…” \n \nSouthern Oaks argues that what Horizon relied on at trial as showing irreconcilable differences—the \ndecisions of how profits were to be determined and divided—were not “good faith differences of opinion,” \nnor did they have “a material and adverse impact on the conduct of the Partnerships’ Business.” Horizon’s \nrefusal to pay Southern Oaks according to the terms of the contracts was not an “irreconcilable difference” \nas defined by the contract, Southern Oaks asserts, pointing out that Horizon’s acts were held to be \nbreaches of the contracts. Because there was no contract basis for dissolution, Horizon’s assertion of \ndissolution was wrongful, Southern Oaks concludes. \n \nSouthern Oaks contends further that not only were there no contractual grounds for dissolution, \ndissolution was also wrongful under the Florida Statutes. Southern Oaks argues that pursuant to section \n[of that statute] Horizon had the power to dissociate from the partnership, but, in the absence of contract \ngrounds for the dissociation, Horizon wrongfully dissociated. It asserts that it is entitled to lost future \nprofits under Florida’s partnership law.… \n \nWe find Southern Oaks’ argument without merit.

Many government \nprograms reflect peoples’ interest in adverting risk: federal deposit insurance, Social Security, and \nbankruptcy, to name three. And of course corporate limited liability has existed for two hundred \nyears. [6] Whether the movement to allow almost anybody the right to a business organization that affords \nlimited liability will encourage entrepreneurship and business activity or whether it will usher in a new \nera of moral hazard—people being allowed to escape the consequences of their own irresponsibility—is \nyet to be seen. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBusinesspeople always prefer to reduce their risks. The partnership form imposes serious potential risk: \nunlimited personal liability. The corporate form eliminates that risk but imposes some onerous formalities and \ndouble taxation. Early on, then, the limited partnership form was born, but it still imposed unlimited liability \non the general partner and on the limited partner if she became too actively involved. Congress was induced \nin the mid-1950s to allow certain small US corporations the right to single taxation, but the sub-S corporation \nstill suffered from various limitations on its structure. In the 1980s, the limited liability company was invented; \nit has become the entity of choice for many businesspeople, but its availability for professionals was limited. \nIn the late 1980s, the limited liability partnership form gained favor, and in the early 2000s, the limited liability \nlimited partnership finished off unlimited liability for limited partnerships. \n \nEXERCISES",

This form, though \nmostly governed by partnership law, eschews the vicarious liability of nonacting partners for another’s \ntorts, malpractice, or partnership breaches of contract.

Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England.

This inability, based on a fear of professionals’ being subject to the direction of the corporate owners, was financially disadvantageous. Under the federal income tax laws then in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During the 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax benefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a professional corporation just as it would any other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of tax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension. That decision led to a burgeoning number of professional corporations."

The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract.

Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed.

Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers.

At the same time it \nmoved for summary judgment and supported the motion by affidavit. In due course, Cranson filed a \ngeneral issue plea and an affidavit in opposition to summary judgment in which he asserted in effect that \nthe Bureau was a de facto corporation and that he was not personally liable for its debts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n622 \nThe agreed statement of facts shows that in April 1961, Cranson was asked to invest in a new business \ncorporation which was about to be created. Towards this purpose he met with other interested individuals \nand an attorney and agreed to purchase stock and become an officer and director. Thereafter, upon being \nadvised by the attorney that the corporation had been formed under the laws of Maryland, he paid for and \nreceived a stock certificate evidencing ownership of shares in the corporation, and was shown the \ncorporate seal and minute book. The business of the new venture was conducted as if it were a \ncorporation, through corporate bank accounts, with auditors maintaining corporate books and records, \nand under a lease entered into by the corporation for the office from which it operated its business. \nCranson was elected president and all transactions conducted by him for the corporation, including the \ndealings with I.B.M., were made as an officer of the corporation. At no time did he assume any personal \nobligation or pledge his individual credit to I.B.M.

What are the differences between creating a corporation de facto and by estoppel? \n \n \n \n \n14.8 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThe hallmark of the corporate form of business enterprise is limited liability for its owners. Other features \nof corporations are separation of ownership and management, perpetual existence, and easy \ntransferability of interests. In the early years of the common law, corporations were thought to be \ncreatures of sovereign power and could be created only by state grant. But by the late nineteenth century, \ncorporations could be formed by complying with the requirements of general corporation statutes in \nvirtually every state. Today the standard is the Revised Model Business Corporation Act. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n625 \n \nThe corporation, as a legal entity, has many of the usual rights accorded natural persons. The principle of \nlimited liability is broad but not absolute: when the corporation is used to commit a fraud or an injustice \nor when the corporation does not act as if it were one, the courts will pierce the corporate veil and pin \nliability on stockholders. \n \nBesides the usual business corporation, there are other forms, including not-for-profit corporations and \nprofessional corporations. Business corporations are classified into two types: publicly held and closely \nheld corporations. \n \nTo form a corporation, the would-be stockholders must choose the state in which they wish to \nincorporate. The goal of the incorporation process is issuance of a corporate charter. The charter is a \ncontract between the state and the corporation. Although the Constitution prohibits states from impairing \nthe obligation of contracts, states reserve the right to modify corporate charters. \n \nThe corporation is created by the incorporators (or promoters), who raise capital, enter into contracts on \nbehalf of the corporation to be formed, and prepare the articles of incorporation. The promoters are \npersonally liable on the contracts they enter into before the corporation is formed. Incorporators owe a \nfiduciary duty to each other, to investors, and to the corporation.",

Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business. Stock is the smallest source of new capital but is of critical importance to the \ncorporation in launching the business and its initial operations. Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration. Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do \nnot want to avail themselves of these financing options. Instead, they seek to raise funds through \nprivate equity, which involves private investors providing funds to a company in exchange for an \ninterest in the company. A private equity firm is a group of investors who pool their money together for \ninvestment purposes, usually to invest in other companies. Looking to private equity firms is an option for \nstart-ups—companies newly formed or in the process of being formed—that cannot raise funds through \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n632 \nthe bond market or that wish to avoid debt or a public stock sale.

Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups. Generally, private equity firms that provide a lot \nof venture capital must be extremely savvy about the start-up plans of new businesses and must ask the \nstart-up entrepreneurs numerous challenging and pertinent questions. Such private equity firms expect a \nhigher rate of return on their investment than would be available from established companies. Today, \nventure capital is often used to finance entrepreneurial start-ups in biotechnology and clean technology. \n \nSometimes, a private equity firm will buy all the publicly traded shares of a company—a process \ncommonly termed “going private.” Private equity may also be involved in providing financing to \nestablished firms. \n \nAnother source of private equity is angel investors, affluent individuals who operate like venture \ncapitalists, providing capital for a business to get started in exchange for repayment with interest or an \nownership interest. The main difference between an angel investor and a venture capitalist is the source of \nfunds: an angel investor invests his or her own money, while venture capitalists use pooled funds. \n \nPrivate equity firms may also use a leveraged buyout (LBO) to finance the acquisition of another firm. \nDiscussed further in Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign \nCorporations, and Corporate Dissolution\" on Corporate Expansion, in the realm of private equity, an LBO \nis a financing option using debt to acquire another firm. In an LBO, private equity investors use the assets \nof the target corporation as collateral for a loan to purchase that target corporation. Such investors may \npursue an LBO as a debt acquisition option since they do not need to use much—or even any—of their own \nmoney in order to finance the acquisition. \n \nA major drawback to private equity, whether through a firm or through venture capital, is the risk versus \nreturn trade-off. Private equity investors may demand a significant interest in the firm, or a high return, \nto compensate them for the riskiness of their investment. They may demand a say in how the firm is \noperated or a seat on the board of directors.",

The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the \ndefinition in the 1933 and 1934 acts. Thus a security may be governed by the securities acts but not by the \nUCC. The definition of a private placement of securities also differs between the UCC and the securities \nacts. Other differences exist. [2] The UCC, as well as state-specific laws, and the federal securities laws \nshould all be considered in financial transactions. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe RMBCA advises doing away with financial concepts such as stock par value.

Today, the task is fraught with legal risk \nas well. \n \nTwo main fiduciary duties apply to both directors and officers: one is a duty of loyalty, the other the duty \nof care. These duties arise from responsibilities placed upon directors and officers because of their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n685 \npositions within the corporation. The requirements under these duties have been refined over time. \nCourts and legislatures have both narrowed the duties by defining what is or is not a breach of each duty \nand have also expanded their scope. Courts have further refined the duties, such as laying out tests such \nas in the Caremark case, outlined in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\". Additionally, other duties have been \ndeveloped, such as the duties of good faith and candor. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nAs a fiduciary of the corporation, the director owes his primary loyalty to the corporation and its \nstockholders, as do the officers and majority shareholders. This responsibility is called \nthe duty of loyalty. When there is a conflict between a director’s personal interest and the interest of the \ncorporation, he is legally bound to put the corporation’s interest above his own.

Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care.

For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof.

Ovitz’s time at Disney was \ntumultuous and short-lived.]…In December 1996, only fourteen months after he commenced \nemployment, Ovitz was terminated without cause, resulting in a severance payout to Ovitz valued at \napproximately $ 130 million. [Disney shareholders then filed derivative actions on behalf of Disney \nagainst Ovitz and the directors of Disney at the time of the events complained of (the “Disney \ndefendants”), claiming that the $130 million severance payout was the product of fiduciary duty and \ncontractual breaches by Ovitz and of breaches of fiduciary duty by the Disney defendants and a waste of \nassets.

The conduct that is the subject of due care \nmay overlap with the conduct that comes within the rubric of good faith in a psychological sense, but from \na legal standpoint those duties are and must remain quite distinct.… \n \nThe Delaware General Assembly has addressed the distinction between bad faith and a failure to exercise \ndue care (i.e., gross negligence) in two separate contexts. The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del.

In the context of corporate law, bad faith can refer to a director's or officer's failure to act in the best interests of the corporation, or to act in a manner that is not in good faith. This can include, but is not limited to, acts of fraud, dishonesty, or self-dealing."

To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith. In our view it must be, for at least two reasons. \n \nFirst, the universe of fiduciary misconduct is not limited to either disloyalty in the classic sense (i.e., \npreferring the adverse self-interest of the fiduciary or of a related person to the interest of the \ncorporation) or gross negligence.

As a \nresult, one of many statutes enacted in the aftermath of Watergate, the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977, was incorporated into the 1934 Securities Exchange \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n725 \nAct. The SEC’s legal interest in the matter is not premised on the morality of bribery but rather on the \nfalsity of the financial statements that are being filed. \n \nCongress’s response to abuses of financial reporting, the FCPA, was much broader than necessary to treat \nthe violations that were uncovered. The FCPA prohibits an issuer (i.e., any US business enterprise), a \nstockholder acting on behalf of an issuer, and “any officer, director, employee, or agent” of an issuer from \nusing either the mails or interstate commerce corruptly to offer, pay, or promise to pay anything of value \nto foreign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates if the purpose is to gain business by inducing \nthe foreign official to influence an act of the government to render a decision favorable to the US \ncorporation. \n \nBut not all payments are illegal. Under 1988 amendments to the FCPA, payments may be made to \nexpedite routine governmental actions, such as obtaining a visa. And payments are allowed if they are \nlawful under the written law of a foreign country. More important than the foreign-bribe provisions, the \nact includes accounting provisions, which broaden considerably the authority of the SEC. These \nprovisions are discussed in SEC v.

Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits. The law applies to any company with more than $10 million in assets and at \nleast five hundred or more shareholders of any class of stock. \n \nSuppose that on January 1, Bob (a company officer) purchases one hundred shares of stock in BCT \nBookstore, Inc., for $60 a share. On September 1, he sells them for $100 a share. What is the result? Bob \nis in the clear, because his $4,000 profit was not realized during a six-month period. Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why? In August, Bob held one hundred shares of stock, and he did again on \nOctober 1—within a six-month period. His net gain on these transactions was $7,000 ($10,000 realized",

The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company. This law requires issuers to keep accurate \nsets of books reflecting the dispositions of their assets and to maintain internal accounting controls to \nensure that transactions comport with management’s authorization. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 presents special hazards to those trading in public stock on the basis \nof inside information. One provision requires the reimbursement to the company of any profits made \nfrom selling and buying stock during a six-month period by directors, officers, and shareholders owning \n10 percent or more of the company’s stock.

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt.

                    "answer": "If a shareholder has the right to vote on a corporate plan to merge, consolidate, or sell all or substantially all of its assets, that shareholder has the right to dissent and invoke appraisal rights. Returning again to BCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the wisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying Truckman. The law requires the shareholder to file with the corporation, before the vote, a notice of intention to demand the fair value of his shares. If the plan is approved and the shareholder does not vote in favor, the corporation must send a notice to the shareholder specifying procedures for obtaining payment, and the shareholder must demand payment within the time set in the notice, which cannot be less than thirty days. Fair value means the value of shares immediately before the effective date of the corporate action to which the shareholder has objected. Appreciation and depreciation in anticipation of the action are excluded, unless the exclusion is unfair. If the shareholder and the company cannot agree on the fair value, the shareholder must file a petition requesting a court to determine the fair value. The method of determining fair value depends on the circumstances. When there is a public market for stock traded on an exchange, fair value is usually the price quoted on the exchange. In some circumstances, other factors, especially net asset value and investment value—for example, earnings potential—assume greater importance."

The first involves the purchase of assets not in the \nordinary course of business. Using this method, the purchase expands the corporation.

The Williams Act requires that a tender offer must be made public and must include certain disclosures, such as the identity of the offeror and the price being offered.

            "chunk": "question might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state. These transactions must meet the minimum-contacts \nrequirement for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes.

A corporation may take over another company by purchasing a controlling interest of its stock, commonly referred to as a takeover. This is accomplished by appealing directly to the target company’s shareholders. In the case of a large publicly held corporation, the appeal is known as a tender offer, which is not an offer but an invitation to shareholders to tender their stock at a stated price. A leveraged buyout involves using the target corporation’s assets as security for a loan used to purchase the target."

Like money, commercial paper is a medium of exchange, but because it \nis one step removed from money, difficulties arise that require a series of interlocking rules to protect \nboth sellers and buyers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n775 \nTo understand the importance of commercial paper, consider the following example. It illustrates a \ndistinction that is critical to the discussion in our four chapters on commercial paper. \n \nLorna Love runs a tennis club. She orders a truckload of new tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc., a \nmanufacturer. The contract price of the rackets is $100,000. Rackets ships the rackets to Love. Rackets \nthen sells for $90,000 its contract rights (rights to receive the payment from Love of $100,000) to First \nBank (see Figure 19.1 \"Assignment of Contract Rights\"). Unfortunately, the rackets that arrive at Love’s \nare warped and thus commercially worthless. Rackets files for bankruptcy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.1 Assignment of Contract Rights \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n776 \nMay the bank collect from Love $100,000, the value of the contract rights it purchased? No. Under the \n“shoe rule” an assignee—here, the bank—steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes the assigned rights \nsubject to any defense of the obligor, Love. (Here, of course, Love’s defense against paying is that the \nrackets are worthless.) The result would be the same if Love had given Rackets a nonnegotiable note, \nwhich Rackets proceeded to sell to the bank. (By nonnegotiable we do not mean that the note cannot be \nsold but only that certain legal requirements, discussed in Section 19.3 \"Requirements for \nNegotiability\" of this chapter, have not been met.) \n \nNow let us add one fact: In addition to signing a contract, Love gives Rackets a negotiable note in \nexchange for the rackets, and Rackets sells the note to the bank. By adding that the note is negotiable, the \nresult changes significantly. Because the note is negotiable and because the bank, we assume, bought the \nnote in good faith (i.e., unaware that the rackets were warped), the bank will recover the $100,000",

In essence, this is the power to convey to a transferee the right in turn to convey clear title, \nwhen the original transferor does not have clear title. \n \nOverview of Chapters on Commercial Paper \nIn this chapter, we examine the history and nature of commercial paper and define the types of parties \n(persons who have an interest in the paper) and the types of instruments. We then proceed to four \nfundamental issues that must be addressed to determine whether parties such as First Bank, in the \npreceding example, can collect: \n1. Is the paper negotiable? That is, is the paper in the proper form? We explore that issue in this \nchapter. \n2. Was the paper negotiated properly? See Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n778 \n3. Is the purchaser of the paper a holder in due course? See Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and \nDefenses\". \n4. Does the maker of the paper have available any defenses against even the holder in due course? \nSee Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \nIn most transactions, especially when the first three questions are answered affirmatively, the purchaser \nwill have little trouble collecting. But when the purchaser is unable to collect, questions of liability arise. \nThese questions, along with termination of liability, are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\".",

The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law. All states except New York and North Carolina have adopted \nArticles 3 and 4. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n780 \nThe Future of Commercial Paper: Federal and International Preemption \nState law governing commercial paper is vulnerable to federal preemption.

An important example is the Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act, which became effective in 1988 (discussed in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"). \n \nFederal preemption may also become intertwined with international law. In 1988, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International \nPromissory Notes. Progress on the treaty emanating from the convention has been slow, however: the \nUnited States, Canada, and Russia have approved the convention (in 1989 and 1990) but have not ratified \nthe treaty; Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Liberia, and Mexico are the only countries to have ratified it. \n \nCommercial Paper in Economics and Finance \nEconomics \nTo the economist, one type of commercial paper—the bank check—is the primary component of M1, the \nbasic money supply. It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

In England and the British Commonwealth, drafts are called bills \nof exchange. Like a draft, a bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest. Used \nprimarily in international trade, it is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a \nspecific date sometime in the future. If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft. If \nit is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft. Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a \ndraft, but whereas a draft is always negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true \nof a bill of exchange. \n \nA widely used draft in international trade is the banker’s acceptance. It is a short-term credit \ninvestment created by a nonfinancial firm and guaranteed by a bank. This instrument is used when an \nexporter agrees to extend credit to an importer. \n \nAssume Love, the importer, is in New York; Rackets, the exporter, is in Taiwan. Rackets is willing to \npermit Love to pay ninety days after shipment. Love makes a deal with her New York bank to issue \nRackets’ bank in Taiwan a letter of credit. This tells the seller’s bank that the buyer’s bank is willing to \naccept a draft drawn on the buyer in accordance with terms spelled out in the letter of credit. Love’s bank \nmay insist on a security interest in the tennis rackets, or it may conclude that Love is creditworthy. On \nreceipt of the letter of credit, Rackets presents its bank in Taiwan with a draft drawn on Love’s bank. That \nbank antes up the purchase amount (less its fees and interest), paying Rackets directly. It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786",

The CD is a \nwritten acknowledgment by a bank that it has received money and agrees to repay it at a time specified in \nthe certificate. The first negotiable CD was issued in 1961 by First National City Bank of New York (now \nCitibank); it was designed to compete for corporate cash that companies were investing in Treasury notes \nand other funds. Because CDs are negotiable, they can be traded easily if the holder wants cash, though \ntheir price fluctuates with the market. \n \n \nOther Parties to Commercial Paper \nIn addition to makers, drawees, and payees, there are five other capacities in which one can deal with \ncommercial paper. \n \nIndorser and Indorsee \nThe indorser (also spelled endorser) is one who transfers ownership of a negotiable instrument by \nsigning it. A depositor indorses a check when presenting it for deposit by signing it on the back. The bank \ndeposits its own funds, in the amount of the check, to the depositor’s account. By indorsing it, the \ndepositor transfers ownership of the check to the bank. The depositor’s bank then can present it to the \ndrawer’s bank for repayment from the drawer’s funds. The indorsee is the one to whom a draft or note is \nindorsed. When a check is deposited in a bank, the bank is the indorsee. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n788 \nHolder \nA holder is “a person in possession of a negotiable that is payable either to bearer, or to an identified \nperson that is the person in possession.” [2] Holder is thus a generic term that embraces several of the \nspecific types of parties already mentioned. An indorsee and a drawee can be holders. But a holder can \nalso be someone unnamed whom the original parties did not contemplate by name—for example, the \nholder of a bearer note. \n \nHolder in Due Course \nA holder in due course is a special type of holder who, if certain requirements are met, acquires rights \nbeyond those possessed by the transferor (we alluded to this in describing the significance of Lorna Love’s \nmaking of a negotiable—as opposed to a nonnegotiable—instrument).

We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to \nanother party to the instrument. It does not matter in what capacity she signs, whether as maker or \ncomaker, drawer or codrawer, or indorser. As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay). The extent of the accommodation party’s liability to pay depends on whether she has \nadded language specifying her purposes in signing. Section 3-416 of the UCC distinguishes between a \nguaranty of payment and a guaranty of collection. An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment. Only if the \njudgment is unsatisfied can the holder seek to collect from the accommodation party. When words of \nguaranty do not specify the type, the law presumes a payment guaranty. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n789 \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe modern law of commercial paper is, in general, covered by UCC Article 3. The two basic types of \ncommercial paper are drafts and notes. The note is a two-party instrument whereby one person (maker) \npromises to pay money to a second person (payee). The draft is a three-party instrument whereby one person \n(drawer) directs a second (drawee) to pay money to the third (payee). Drafts may be sight drafts, payable on \nsight, or they may be time drafts, payable at a date specified on the draft. Checks are drafts drawn on banks. \nOther parties include indorser and indorsee, holder, holder in due course, and accommodation party. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

An instrument may be payable to the order of \nthe maker, drawer, drawee, or someone else. It also may be payable to the order of two or more payees \n(together or in the alternative), to an estate, a trust, or a fund (in which case it is payable to the \nrepresentative, to an office or officer, or to a partnership or unincorporated association). Suppose a \nprinted form says that the instrument is payable both to order and to bearer. In that event, the instrument \nis payable only to order. However, if the words “to bearer” are handwritten or typewritten, then the \ninstrument can be payable either to order or to bearer. \n \nA negotiable instrument not payable to a particular person must be payable to bearer, meaning to any \nperson who presents it. To be payable to bearer, the instrument may say “payable to bearer” or “to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n794 \norder of bearer.” It may also say “payable to John Doe or bearer.” Or it may be made payable to cash or \nthe order of cash. \n \nSection 3-104(c) of the UCC excepts checks from the requirement that the instrument be “payable to \nbearer or order.” Official Comment 2 to that section explains why checks are not required to have the \n“payable” wording: “Subsection (c) is based on the belief that it is good policy to treat checks, which are \npayment instruments, as negotiable instruments whether or not they contain the words ‘to the order of.’ \nThese words are almost always pre-printed on the check form.…Absence of the quoted words can easily be \noverlooked and should not affect the rights of holders who may pay money or give credit for a check \nwithout being aware that it is not in the conventional form.” \n \nAlso affecting this policy is the fact that almost all checks are now read by machines, not human beings. \nThere is no one to see that the printed form does not contain the special words, and the significance of the \nwords is recognized by very few people. In short, it doesn’t matter for checks. \n \nMissing and Ambiguous Terms \nThe rules just stated make up the conditions for negotiability.

Notwithstanding the presence of readily \navailable form instruments, sometimes people leave words out or draw up confusing documents. \n \nIncompleteness \nAn incomplete instrument—one that is missing an essential element, like the due date or amount—can be \nsigned before being completed if the contents at the time of signing show that the maker or drawer \nintends it to become a negotiable instrument. Unless the date of an instrument is required to determine \nwhen it is payable, an undated instrument can still be negotiable. [3] Otherwise, to be enforceable, the \ninstrument must first be completed—if not by the maker or drawer, then by the holder in accordance with \nwhatever authority he has to do so.

Thus the negotiable instrument must be in writing, signed by the maker or drawer, an \nunconditional promise or order to pay, for a fixed amount in money, payable on demand or at a definite time, \nand payable to order or bearer, unless it is a check.

It is essential, said the court, for a negotiable instrument “to bear \na definite sum so that subsequent holders may take and transfer the instrument without having to plumb \nthe intricacies of the instrument’s background.… \n \nIn A. Alport & Son, Inc. v. Hotel Evans, Inc., [Citation] (1970), a note contained the notation “with \ninterest at bank rates.” Applying a section of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted by New York \nidentical to [3-104(a)] the court held the note was not a negotiable instrument in that the amount of \ninterest had to be established by facts outside the instrument. \n \nIn the instant case, the Campbells insist that it is impossible to determine from the face of the note the \namount due and payable on any payment date, as the note provides that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand.

Perhaps the bank teller in the example about the \ntennis-ball scam should have inquired whether the young man had any authority to cash the check made \nout to Sprocket Athletic Supply. If so, the bank could be partly liable. Or suppose Lorna Love regularly \nuses a rubber signature stamp for her tennis club business but one day carelessly leaves it unprotected. As \na result, the stamp and some checks are stolen; Love bears any loss for being negligent. Similarly liable is \na person who has had previous notice that his signature has been forged and has taken no steps to prevent \nreoccurrences, as is a person who negligently mails a check to the wrong person, one who has the same \nname as the payee. The UCC provides that the negligence of two or more parties might be compared in \norder to determine whether each party bears a percentage of the loss, as illustrated inVictory Clothing \nCo., Inc. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A.

Instruments may be made payable to two or more parties in the \nalternative or jointly and must be indorsed accordingly. Generally, a forged indorsement is ineffective, but \nexceptions hold for cases involving imposters, fictitious payees, and certain employee dishonesty. If a person’s \nown negligence contributes to the forgery, that person must bear as much of the loss as is attributable to his \nor her negligence. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n830 \n \n1.

This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York.

Instead, \nsubsections (a) and (b) [now] use the term “transfer of possession,” and subsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession.

A well-respected local attorney walks into the bank with a check \nfor $100,000 that he wants to deposit in the general account his firm has at your bank. The payee on the \ncheck is an elderly widow, Hilda Jones, who received the check from the profit-sharing plan of her \ndeceased husband, Horatio Jones. The widow indorsed the check “Pay to the order of the estate of \nHoratio Jones. Hilda Jones.” The attorney produces court documents showing that he is the executor of \nthe estate. After the attorney indorses the check, you deposit the check in the attorney’s account.

Know what the shelter rule is and why the rule exists. \n \n \n \nOverview of the Holder-in-Due-Course Concept \nImportance of the Holder-in-Due-Course Concept \nA holder is a person in possession of an instrument payable to bearer or to the identified person \npossessing it. But a holder’s rights are ordinary, as we noted briefly in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of \nCommercial Paper\". If a person to whom an instrument is negotiated becomes nothing more than a \nholder, the law of commercial paper would not be very significant, nor would a negotiable instrument be a \nparticularly useful commercial device. A mere holder is simply an assignee, who acquires the assignor’s \nrights but also his liabilities; an ordinary holder must defend against claims and overcome defenses just as \nhis assignor would. The holder in due course is really the crux of the concept of commercial paper and the \nkey to its success and importance. What the holder in due course gets is an instrument free of claims or \ndefenses by previous possessors. A holder with such a preferred position can then treat the instrument \nalmost as money, free from the worry that someone might show up and prove it defective. \n \nRequirements for Being a Holder in Due Course \nUnder Section 3-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), to be a holder in due course (HDC), a \ntransferee must fulfill the following: \n1.

Plaintiff \nthen filed suit…to enforce Hauser Co.’s liability on the checks. The trial court granted plaintiff’s motion for \nsummary judgment. Hauser Co. appeals the grant of summary judgment.…We affirm. \n \nIn October 1998, Alfred M. Hauser, president of Hauser Co., was notified by Edwards Food Store in \nRaritan and the Somerset Valley Bank (the Bank), that several individuals were cashing what appeared to \nbe Hauser Co. payroll checks. Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments. Mr. Hauser \nconcluded that the checks were counterfeits because none of the payees were employees of Hauser Co., \nand because he did not write the checks or authorize anyone to sign those checks on his behalf. At that \ntime, Hauser Co. employed Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) to provide payroll services and a \nfacsimile signature was utilized on all Hauser Co. payroll checks. \n \nMr. Hauser executed affidavits of stolen and forged checks at the Bank, stopping payment on the checks at \nissue. Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn.

Judge Hoens concluded that because the \ncheck cashing companies took the checks in good faith, plaintiff was a holder in due course as assignee. \nJudge Hoens also found that because the checks appeared to be genuine, Hauser Co. was required, but \nhad failed, to show that plaintiff’s assignor had any notice that the checks were not validly drawn.… \n \nHauser Co. argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because the court failed to properly \naddress Hauser Co.’s defense that the checks at issue were invalid negotiable instruments and therefore \nerred in finding plaintiff was a holder in due course. \n \nAs a threshold matter, it is evident that the eighteen checks meet the definition of a negotiable instrument \n[UCC 3-104].

In addition, each \ncheck appears to have been signed by Mr. Hauser, through the use of a facsimile stamp, permitted by the \nUCC to take the place of a manual signature. [Section 3-401(b) of the UCC] provides that a “signature may \nbe made manually or by means of a device or machine…with present intention to authenticate a writing.” \nIt is uncontroverted by Hauser Co. that the facsimile signature stamp on the checks is identical to Hauser \nCo.’s authorized stamp. \n \nHauser Co., however, contends that the checks are not negotiable instruments because Mr. Hauser did not \nsign the checks, did not authorize their signing, and its payroll service, ADP, did not produce the checks. \nLack of authorization, however, is a separate issue from whether the checks are negotiable instruments. \nConsequently, given that the checks are negotiable instruments, the next issue is whether the checks are \nunenforceable by a holder in due course, because the signature on the checks was forged or unauthorized.",

In support of his summary judgment motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit from each \ncompany; each company swore that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any \nclaims or defenses by any party, without knowledge that any of the signatures on the checks were \nunauthorized or fraudulent, and with the expectation that the checks would be paid upon their \npresentment to the bank upon which the checks were drawn. Hauser Co. does not dispute any of the facts \nsworn to by the check cashing companies. \n \nThe checks were then transferred to plaintiff in accordance with section 3-303, vesting plaintiff with \nholder in due course status. Each company swore that it assigned the checks to plaintiff in exchange for \nconsideration received from plaintiff. Plaintiff thus acquired the check cashing companies’ holder in due \ncourse status when the checks were assigned to plaintiff. Moreover, pursuant to section 3-403(a)’s \nrequirement that the transfer must have been made for the purpose of giving the transferee the right to \nenforce the instrument, the assignment agreements expressly provided plaintiff with that right, stating \nthat “all payments [assignor] may receive from any of the referenced Debtors…shall be the exclusive \nproperty of [assignee].” Again, Hauser Co. does not dispute any facts relating to the assignment of the \nchecks to plaintiff. \n \nHauser Co. contends, instead, that the checks are per se invalid because they were fraudulent and \nunauthorized.

Certain \nfacts do not necessarily give notice of defense or claim: that the instrument is antedated or postdated, that \nthe instrument was negotiated in return for an executory promise, that any party has signed for \naccommodation, that an incomplete instrument has been completed, that any person negotiating the \ninstrument is or was a fiduciary, or that there has been default in payment of interest or principal. \nA person who could not have become an HDC directly (e.g., because he had notice of a defense or claim) \nmay become so if he takes as transferee from an HDC as long as he was not a party to any fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument or had not previously been a holder with notice of a defense or claim. \nThis is the shelter rule. \n \nHolders in due course are not immune from all defenses. A real, as opposed to a personal, defense may be \nasserted against the HDC. Personal defenses include fraud in the inducement, failure of consideration, \nnonperformance of a condition precedent, and the like. Real defenses consist of infancy, acts that would \nmake a contract void (such as duress), fraud in the execution, forgery, and discharge in bankruptcy. A \n1976 trade regulation rule of the Federal Trade Commission abolishes the holder-in-due-course rule for \nconsumer transactions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES",

The UCC makes giving notice pretty easy: it permits any party who may be compelled to pay the \ninstrument to notify any party who may be liable on it (but each person who is to be charged with liability \nmust actually be notified); notice of dishonor may “be given by any commercially reasonable means \nincluding an oral, written, or electronic communication”; and no specific form of notice is required—it is \n“sufficient if it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument has been \ndishonored or has not been paid or accepted.” [11] Section 3-503(c) sets out time limits when notice of \ndishonor must be given for collecting banks and for other persons.

Understand that independent of contract liability, parties to negotiable instruments incur warranty liability. \n2. Know what warranties a person makes when she transfers an instrument. \n3. Know what warranties a person makes when he presents an instrument for payment or acceptance. \n4. Understand what happens if a bank pays or accepts a check by mistake. \n \n \nOverview of Warranty Liability \nWe discussed the contract liability of primary and secondary parties, which applies to those who sign the \ninstrument. Liability arises a second way, too—by warranty. A negotiable instrument is a type of property \nthat is sold and bought, just the way an automobile is, or a toaster. If you buy a car, you generally expect \nthat it will, more or less, work the way cars are supposed to work—that’s the implied warranty of \nmerchantability. Similarly, when an instrument is transferred from A to B for consideration, the \ntransferee (B) expects that the instrument will work the way such instruments are supposed to work. If A \ntransfers to B a promissory note made by Maker, B figures that when the time is right, she can go to \nMaker and get paid on the note. So A makes some implied warranties to B—transfer warranties. And \nwhen B presents the instrument to Maker for payment, Maker assumes that B as the indorsee from A is \nentitled to payment, that the signatures are genuine, and the like. So B makes some implied warranties to \nMaker—presentment warranties. Usually, claims of breach of warranty arise in cases involving forged, \naltered, or stolen instruments, and they serve to allocate the loss to the person in the best position to have \navoided the loss, putting it on the person (or bank) who dealt with the wrongdoer. We take up both \ntransfer and presentment warranties. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n902 \n \nTransfer Warranties \nTransfer warranties are important because—as we’ve seen—contract liability is limited to those who have \nactually signed the instrument. Of course, secondary liability will provide a holder with sufficient grounds \nfor recovery against a previous indorser who did not qualify his indorsement. But sometimes there is no \nindorsement, and sometimes the indorsement is qualified. Sometimes, also, the holder fails to make \ntimely presentment or notice of dishonor, thereby discharging a previous indorsee. In such cases, the",

Sometimes, also, the holder fails to make \ntimely presentment or notice of dishonor, thereby discharging a previous indorsee. In such cases, the \ntransferee-holder can still sue a prior party on one or more of the five implied warranties. \n \nA person who receives consideration for transferring an instrument makes the five warranties listed in \nUCC Section 3-416. The warranty may be sued on by the immediate transferee or, if the transfer was by \nindorsement, by any subsequent holder who takes the instrument in good faith. The warranties thus run \nwith the instrument. They are as follows: \n \n1. The transferor is entitled to enforce the instrument. The transferor warrants that he is—or would have \nbeen if he weren’t transferring it—entitled to enforce the instrument. As UCC Section 3-416, Comment \n2, puts it, this “is in effect a warranty that there are no unauthorized or missing indorsements that \nprevent the transferor from making the transferee a person entitled to enforce the instrument.” \nSuppose Maker makes a note payable to Payee; Thief steals the note, forges Payee’s indorsement, and \nsells the note.

Buyer sells the note to \nAnother Party, who can hold Buyer liable for breach of the warranty: he was not entitled to enforce it. \n2. All signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized. This warranty would be breached, too, \nin the example just presented. \n3. The instrument has not been altered. \n4.

Payee \npresents the check to Drawer to make it good: Payee warrants he is entitled to payment on it. \n \nWarranties cannot be disclaimed in the case of checks (because, as UCC Section 3-417, Comment 7, puts \nit, “it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be \nexamined by the payor bank”—they’re machine read). But a disclaimer of warranties is permitted as to \nother instruments, just as disclaimers of warranty are usually OK under general contract law. The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake.

Example: Able draws a check to Baker. Baker deposits the \ncheck in her bank account, and Able’s bank mistakenly pays it even though Able doesn’t have enough \nmoney in his account to cover it.

Discussion \nA. Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability. \nTransfer warranties trigger when a person transfers an instrument for consideration. UCC § 3-416(a)). A \ntransfer, for purposes of the statute, occurs when an instrument is delivered by a person other than its \nissuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. § 3-\n203(a). Martin transferred an instrument to PNC when he endorsed the check and deposited it in his \naccount, thereby granting PNC the right to enforce the check. [Citation] Consideration, for purposes of the \nstatute, need only be enough to support a simple contract. [Citation] Martin received consideration from \nPNC because PNC made the funds provisionally available before confirming whether First Century Bank \nwould honor the check. \n \nAs a warrantor, Martin made a number of representations to PNC, including representations that he was \nentitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. [UCC] § \n3-416(a). Martin breached his warranties twofold. First, he was not entitled to enforce the check because \nthe check was a counterfeit and, as a result, Martin had nothing to enforce. Second, the drawer’s signature \nwas not authentic because the check was a counterfeit. \n \nMartin does not dispute these facts. Instead, Martin argues, summary judgment is inappropriate because \nFriedman and Jennewein admitted that PNC made a mistake when Friedman said that he thought the \ncheck cleared and Jennewein said that she never would have authorized the wire transfer. Friedman’s and \nJennewein’s statements are immaterial facts. The transfer warranties placed the risk of loss on Martin, \nregardless of whether PNC, Martin, or both of them were at fault.

First, all but one of the cases were decided before the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Martin fails to argue, much less demonstrate, \nthat his cases are good law. Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss. Martin’s cases address who \nbears the risk of loss as between other players: a drawee bank and a collecting agent [Citation]; a drawer \nand a drawee bank [Citation]; and an execution creditor and drawee bank [Citation—all of these cases are \nfrom 1910–1930].

Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card. Under the agreement’s terms, Martin agreed to bind himself to the \nagreement by signing the signature card. Martin does not dispute that the account agreement was a \nbinding contract, and he does not dispute the account agreement’s terms. \n \nMartin’s account agreement authorized PNC to charge Martin’s account for the value of any item returned \nto PNC unpaid or any item on which PNC did not receive payment. If PNC’s charge-back created an \noverdraft, Martin was required to pay PNC the amount of the overdraft immediately. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n929 \nThe scam of which Martin was a victim falls squarely within the charge-back provision of the account \nagreement.

The answer \nturns on whether the settlement was provisional or final. A settlement is the proper crediting of the \namount ordered to be paid by the instrument. Someone writes you a check for $1,000 drawn on First \nBank, and you deposit it in Second Bank. Second Bank will make a “provisional settlement” with \nyou—that is, it will provisionally credit your account with $1,000, and that settlement will be final \nwhen First Bank debits the check writer’s account and credits Second Bank with the funds.

However, if settlement was final, the \nbank cannot claim a refund. \n \nWhat determines whether settlement is provisional or final?

Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later.

It was enacted in 1988 in response to complaints by \nconsumer groups about long delays before customers were allowed access to funds represented by checks \nthey had deposited. It has nothing to do with electronic transfers, although the increasing use of electronic \ntransfers does speed up the system and make it easier for banks to comply with Regulation CC. \n \nThe Act’s Provisions \nThe act provides that when a customer deposits a cashier’s check, certified check, or a check written on an \naccount in the same bank, the funds must be available by the next business day. Funds from other local \nchecks (drawn on institutions within the same Federal Reserve region) must be available within two \nworking days, while there is a maximum five-day wait for funds from out-of-town checks.

Since 2004 the Check 21 Act has encouraged a trend away from the physical transportation of \nchecks to the electronic transportation of the check’s data, which is truncated (stripped) from the paper \ninstrument and transmitted. However, if a paper instrument is required, a “substitute check” will recreate it. \nThe UCC’s Article 4 deals generally with aspects of the bank-customer relationship, including warranties on \npayment or collection of checks, payment of overdrafts, stop orders, and customers’ duties to detect \nirregularities.

Wholesale transactions are the transfers of funds between businesses or \nfinancial institutions. \n \nBackground and Coverage \nIt was in the development of commercial “wholesale wire transfers” of money in the nineteeth and early \ntwentieth centuries that businesses developed the processes enabling the creation of today’s consumer \nelectronic funds transfers. Professor Jane Kaufman Winn described the development of uniform law \ngoverning commercial funds transfers: \n \nAlthough funds transfers conducted over funds transfer facilities maintained by the Federal \nReserve Banks were subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, many funds transfers \ntook place over private systems, such as the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems \n(“CHIPS”). The entire wholesale funds transfer system was not governed by a clear body of law \nuntil U.C.C. Article 4A was promulgated in 1989 and adopted by the states shortly thereafter. The \nArticle 4A drafting process resulted in many innovations, even though it drew heavily on the \npractices that had developed among banks and their customers during the 15 years before the \ndrafting committee was established. While a consensus was not easy to achieve, the community \nof interests shared by both the banks and their customers permitted the drafting process to find \nworkable compromises on many thorny issues.[1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n958 \nAll states and US territories have adopted Article 4A.

Article 4A does not apply if any \nstep of the transaction is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Although the implication may be \notherwise, the rules in Article 4A apply to any funds transfer, not just electronic ones (i.e., transfers by \nmail are covered, too).

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount.

The evidence shows that all bank \nstatements and cancelled checks were sent, via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at \ntheir “designated address” each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary. We therefore find \nthat the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers and that the remaining \nprovisions of 4-406 are applicable to the case at bar.… \nIn defense of her failure to inspect the bank statements, Rogers claims that she never received the bank \nstatements and cancelled checks. Even if this allegation is true, [2] it does not excuse Rogers from failing to \nfulfill her duties under 4-406(a) & (c) because the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in \nproviding the necessary information to a customer when it “sends…to a customer a statement of account \nshowing payment of items.”…The word “receive” is absent.

Usury laws \nestablish a maximum rate of lawful interest. The penalties for violating usury laws vary from state to state. \nThe heaviest penalties are loss of both principal and interest, or loss of a multiple of the interest the \ncreditor charged. The courts often interpret these laws stringently, so that even if the impetus for a \nusurious loan comes from the borrower, the contract can be avoided, as demonstrated in Matter of Dane’s \nEstate (Section 24.3 \"Cases\"). \n \nSome states have eliminated interest rate limits altogether. In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule. Here \nare some common exceptions: \n \n• \nBusiness loans. In many states, businesses may be charged any interest rate, although some states \nlimit this exception to incorporated businesses. \n• \nMortgage loans.

Also, \ncertainly, tight limits on interest rates cause creditors to deny credit to the less creditworthy, which may \nnot be helpful to the lower classes. That’s the rationale for the usury exceptions related to pawnshop and \npayday loans. \n \n \nDisclosure of Credit Costs \nSetting limits on what credit costs—as usury laws do—is one thing. Disclosing the cost of credit is another. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act \nUntil 1969, lenders were generally free to disclose the cost of money loaned or credit extended in any way \nthey saw fit—and they did. Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why? Because with the first loan you will have the use of the full \n$1,000 for the entire year; with the second, for much less than the year because you must begin repaying \npart of the principal within a month. In fact, with the second loan you will have use of only about half the \nmoney for the entire year, and so the actual rate of interest is closer to 15 percent. Things become more \ncomplex when interest is compounded and stated as a monthly figure, when different rates apply to \nvarious portions of the loan, and when processing charges and other fees are stated separately.

[The law] commands \ncancellation of a note in violation of [its provisions]. Here, since both sides concede that the note \nevidences the complete agreement between the parties, we cannot aid appellant by reliance upon the \npresumption that he did not make the loan at a usurious rate [Citation]. The terms of the loan are not in \ndispute. Thus, the note itself establishes, on its face, clear evidence of usury. There is no requirement of a \nspecific intent to violate the usury statute. A general intent to charge more than the legal rate as evidenced \nby the note, is all that is needed. If the lender intends to take and receive a rate in excess of the legal \npercentage at the time the note is made, the statute condemns the act and mandates its cancellation \n[Citation]. The showing, as here, that the note reserves to the lender an illegal rate of interest satisfies \nrespondents’ burden of proving a usurious loan. \n \nNext, where the rate of interest on the face of a note is in excess of the legal rate, it cannot be argued that \nsuch a loan may be saved because the borrower prompted the loan or even set the rate.

The court stated: \n \n[T]he issue in this case is not [Rosa’s] sex, but rather how he chose to dress when applying for a \nloan. Because the Act does not prohibit discrimination based on the manner in which someone \ndresses, Park West’s requirement that Rosa change his clothes does not give rise to claims of \nillegal discrimination.

In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, \nyou’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might \nmake: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you \ndefault), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet \nring. Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the \nparticular goods purchased. A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book. \nWhether a transaction is a lease or a PMSI is an issue that frequently arises. The answer depends on the \nfacts of each case. However, a security interest is created if (1) the lessee is obligated to continue payments \nfor the term of the lease; (2) the lessee cannot terminate the obligation; and (3) one of several economic \ntests, which are listed in UCC Section 1-201 (37), is met. For example, one of the economic tests is that \n“the lessee has an option to become owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal \nadditional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.” \n \nThe issue of lease versus security interest gets litigated because of the requirements of Article 9 that a \nsecurity interest be perfected in certain ways (as we will see). If the transaction turns out to be a security \ninterest, a lessor who fails to meet these requirements runs the risk of losing his property to a third party. \nAnd consider this example. Ferrous Brothers Iron Works “leases” a $25,000 punch press to Millie’s \nMachine Shop.

Most commonly, the debtor owns the collateral (or has some \nownership interest in it).

The UCC provides that a person gives value for rights if he acquires them in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection, as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim, by accepting delivery pursuant to a pre-existing contract for purchase, or generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract."

[23] \n \nThe “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common \nfor the creditor to have possession of—actually or virtually—certified securities, deposit accounts, \nelectronic chattel paper, investment property, or other such paper or electronic evidence of value. [24] \n \nAgain, Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\" diagrams the attachment, showing the necessary elements: the \ncreditor gives value, the debtor has rights in collateral, and there is a security agreement signed \n(authenticated) by the debtor. If the debtor defaults, the creditor’s “hand” will grab (repossess) the \ncollateral. \n \nPerfection of the Security Interest \nAs between the debtor and the creditor, attachment is fine: if the debtor defaults, the creditor will \nrepossess the goods and—usually—sell them to satisfy the outstanding obligation. But unless an additional \nset of steps is taken, the rights of the secured party might be subordinated to the rights of other secured \nparties, certain lien creditors, bankruptcy trustees, and buyers who give value and who do not know of the \nsecurity interest. Perfection is the secured party’s way of announcing the security interest to the rest of \nthe world.

[35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or \nher primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered \norganization. [36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is \nalready encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office \nwill provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available \nfor at least some types of collateral. \n \nExemptions \nSome transactions are exempt from the filing provision.

The law governing agreements for personal property security is \nArticle 9 of the UCC. The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest. This is usually accomplished \nwhen the debtor, in return for value (a loan or credit) extended from the creditor, puts up as collateral some \nvaluable asset in which she has an interest and authenticates (signs) a security agreement (the contract) giving \nthe creditor a security interest in collateral and allowing that the creditor may take it if the debtor defaults. \nThe UCC lists various kinds of assets that can be collateralized, ranging from tangible property (goods), to \nassets only able to be manifested by paper (indispensable paper), to intangible assets (like patent rights). \nSometimes no security agreement is necessary, mostly if the creditor takes possession of the collateral. After \nattachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors \nclaim an interest in the collateral.

On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause.

On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would \nhave priority, because her filing was prior to Erika’s. \n \nWhat would happen if this kind of PMSI in noninventory goods (here, equipment) did not get priority \nstatus? A prudent Erika would not extend credit to Susan at all, and if the new machine is necessary for \nSusan’s business, she would soon be out of business.

It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does.

                    "question": "How can it be said that sureties do not anticipate financial losses like insurance companies do? What’s the difference, and how does the surety avoid losses?",
                    "answer": "Sureties do not anticipate financial losses like insurance companies do because they are not in the business of insuring against risk. Instead, they are in the business of guaranteeing the performance of another party. The difference is that insurance companies charge a premium for their services, while sureties charge a fee for their services. The surety avoids losses by carefully screening the party they are guaranteeing and by requiring the party to provide collateral to back up their guarantee."

                    "question": "Why does the creditor’s failure to perfect a security interest discharge the surety from liability? Why doesn’t failure of the creditor to resort first to perfected collateral discharge the surety?",
                    "answer": "The reason why the creditor’s failure to perfect a security interest discharges the surety from liability is that the surety is only responsible for the debt if the debtor fails to pay. If the creditor fails to perfect their security interest, then they cannot seize the collateral in the event that the debtor defaults. This means that the surety is not required to pay the debt, and they are discharged from liability."

                    "question": "What is the difference between a guarantor and a surety?",
                    "answer": "The difference between a guarantor and a surety is that a guarantor is a person who agrees to be responsible for the debt if the debtor fails to pay, while a surety is a person who agrees to be responsible for the debt if the debtor fails to perform a contractual obligation. In other words, a guarantor is responsible for the debt, while a surety is responsible for the performance of the contract."

The book is\ndesigned for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as\nsecond-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences\nand course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the\nintroduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and\nPreface\n1\neconomics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial\ntheory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more\nrigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical\ncalculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.\nPedagogical Foundation\nPrinciples of Finance emphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business\nfunctions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates\na unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This\nmultifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.\nTheoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are\nintroduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.\nIn order to create meaning for all students, Principles of Finance exposes them to a range of companies,\nindustries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,\nand American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that\nmay be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,\nsmall business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews\ninclude diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.\nProblems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and\ncontexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2).

They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in.

Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses.

In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets.

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm",

The stock market is a\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations. Who can run the country’s economic\nsystem better, Republicans or Democrats? Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic\nperformance even though their actual influence is less than you might think. See this fun comparison chart\n(https://openstax.org/r/macrotrends-net) of political economic performance that measures stock market\nreturns by each administration going back to President Warren Harding in 1920. Who had the highest\noverall increase in the market? What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?\nJust to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, Donald Trump or\nBarack Obama?\nEach of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock\nmarket, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs.

As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.

In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts\ngreater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments.

Accountants\ntrack, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present\nare “book values” and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”\nMarket values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon\nSigns planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when\ncreating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have\nmultiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think\nabout the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay,\nwhile economic value is what you are willing to pay.\n30\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n1.1 What Is Finance?\nFinance is the study of the trade-off between risk and expected return.

Economists attempt to understand the how and\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an\nindividual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.\nEconomics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial\nforecasting.\n1.7 Financial Instruments\nMaturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments. Using this methodology, we have money\nmarkets and capital markets. Money markets consist of short-term marketable securities, and capital markets\nfocus on longer-term securities such as bonds and stocks.\n1.8 Concepts of Time and Value\nThe concepts of time and value involve the resolution of conflict between consumption now versus\nconsumption later.

One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\n2.1\nBusiness Structures\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the business form created by most organizations.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\n•\nList and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized.

However, it is still important to\nunderstand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.\nSole Proprietorships\nA proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of\nforming a business as a sole proprietor is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin\nconducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of\nbusiness organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:\n1.\nThey have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.\n1\nAaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings.

Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners.

Both types of businesses have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs and goals of the business. For example, a sole proprietorship may be easier to set up and manage, but it also has less protection from personal liability. On the other hand, a partnership may offer more financial resources and expertise, but it also requires more coordination and communication between the partners. Ultimately, the decision between a sole proprietorship and a partnership should be based on a careful analysis of the business's needs and goals, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each type of business structure."

This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.",

The owner of a sole proprietorship is the only one responsible for the debts and obligations of the business, so there is no risk of personal liability. Additionally, the profits from the business are taxed only once, at the owner's personal income tax rate. However, a sole proprietorship also has some disadvantages. The business is not a separate legal entity from the owner, so the owner is personally liable for all debts and obligations of the business. This means that if the business fails, the owner's personal assets may be at risk. Additionally, the owner is responsible for all the business's finances and operations, which can be time-consuming and stressful."

Second, a partnership can offer more flexibility in terms of how the business is run, as there can be more than one person making decisions. Third, a partnership can offer more stability, as there is more than one person responsible for the business. Finally, a partnership can offer more tax benefits, as the business can be taxed as a partnership rather than as a sole proprietorship."

First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct",

Ethics refers to the company's commitment to ethical behavior and compliance with laws and regulations. Accountability refers to the company's accountability to its shareholders and other stakeholders. Risk Management refers to the company's ability to identify and manage risks to its operations. Responsibility refers to the company's responsibility to its stakeholders and the environment.

                    "answer": "Corporate governance is a system of rules, policies, and procedures that are designed to ensure that a company is run in the best interests of its shareholders. One of the key goals of corporate governance is to minimize agency problems, which are situations where the interests of the company's directors and management are not aligned with the interests of its shareholders. Agency problems can occur when directors and management have the ability to make decisions that benefit themselves at the expense of the shareholders. Corporate governance helps to minimize agency problems by establishing clear lines of authority and accountability, and by requiring directors and management to act in the best interests of the shareholders. This is done through a number of mechanisms, including the establishment of a board of directors, the adoption of a code of conduct, and the use of independent auditors. These mechanisms help to ensure that the directors and management are held accountable for their actions, and that the interests of the shareholders are protected."

The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for\nsweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30. At a price of $30, the quantity demanded of 20 sweatshirts\nequals the quantity supplied of 20 sweatshirts.\nFigure 3.6 Graph of Demand and Supply for Sweatshirts\nChanges in Equilibrium Price\nA price that is either too high (above the equilibrium price) or too low (below the equilibrium price) is not\nsustainable in a competitive market. Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either\nsupply or demand changes.\nIf supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as in Figure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will\nfall. With the original supply curve, Supply1, the equilibrium price was $15; quantity demanded and quantity\nsupplied were both 30 pizzas at that price. If a new pizza restaurant opens, increasing the supply of pizzas to\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n73\nSupply2, the equilibrium will move from Equilibrium1\nto Equilibrium2\n. The new equilibrium price will\nbe $10. This new equilibrium is associated with a quantity demanded of 40 pizzas and a quantity supplied of 40\npizzas.\nFigure 3.7 Supply Curve Changes When Supply Increases An increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and an increase\nin quantity demanded.\nIt is important to note that the demand curve in Figure 3.7 does not move. In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement an increase in quantity demanded.\nDistinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an\nincrease in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.\nEquilibrium price will also fall if demand falls. Remember that a decrease in demand is represented as a shift\nof the demand curve inward to the left. In Figure 3.8, you can see how a decrease in demand causes a change\nfrom\nto\n.\nFigure 3.8 A Decrease in Demand\nAt the new equilibrium,\n, the price of a pizza is $10. The new equilibrium quantity is 20 pizzas. Note that the\nsupply curve has not moved. Producers moved along their supply curve, producing fewer pizzas as the price\ndropped; this is known as a decrease in quantity supplied.\n74",

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls.

You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n77\ndelivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows\neconomists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a\ntypical family’s purchases.\nIn an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods\npurchased and the purchasing habits of families, Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon founded the Billion\nPrices Project. Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world. The Billion Prices Project website\n(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project) provides measures for inflation using this data as well as\nresearch papers regarding macroeconomic research.\nHistorical Trends in the Inflation Rate\nInflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed in Figure 3.10. The graph shows that for the past\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.",

By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP.

The concepts of supply, demand, and equilibrium apply in this\nmarket just as they do in other markets. This market is referred to as the market for loanable funds.\nIn the market for loanable funds, the suppliers of funds are economic entities that currently have a surplus in\ntheir budget. In other words, they have more income than they currently want to spend; they would like to\nsave some of their money and spend it in future time periods. Instead of just putting these savings in a box on\na shelf for safekeeping until they want to spend it, they can let someone else borrow that money. In essence,\nthey are renting that money to someone else, who pays a rental price called the interest rate.\nThe suppliers of loanable funds, also known as lenders, are represented by the upward-sloping curve in Figure\n3.17. A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\nborrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves.

At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year.

For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\n3.4 • Interest Rates\n87",

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form\nof\nMXN is an abbreviation for the Mexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known\nas a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nBecause this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as the spot\nexchange rate.\nIf you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.\nSimply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:\nIf you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy\ndollars. Each US dollar will cost you MXN 16.",

As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\nexposure. The ski lodge in Colorado will find that its customers from Mexico decrease when the dollar",

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency.

Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\nCash-Basis Accounting\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris",

We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a\nsummer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used\nthe cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was\nusing her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance\ncosts. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.\nThis balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and\ninsurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)",

We will explore the components of the\naccounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\ndegree pursued.\nSolution:\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization.

It is helpful to also think of net worth as the\naccounting value of the organization.

So every dollar of revenue an organization\ngenerates increases the overall value of the organization.\n4.2 • Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\n105\nLikewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue) decrease the value of the organization. So\neach dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization.

If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s\ntractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset.

The\ngraphic representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-account.

A credit records financial information on\nthe right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease.

This\nbecomes easier to understand as you become familiar with the normal balance of an account.\nThe balance sheet is a reflection of the accounting equation (see Figure 4.5). It has two sections, assets in one\nsection and liabilities and equity in the other section. It’s key to note that both assets and liabilities are broken\ndown on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to provide more detail and\ntransparency.

In\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned.

The American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\nrevenue recognition.\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until\ncustomer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you\nrecognize revenue?\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\ngovernment.\nExpense Recognition\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers.

Liam has a lot of information to consider before making this decision.\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\n111\nWhat Is a Fixed Asset?\nAn asset is considered a tangible asset when it is an economic resource that has physical substance—it can\nbe seen and touched. Tangible assets can be either short term, such as inventory and supplies, or long term,\nsuch as land, buildings, and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset, the item needs to be\nused in the normal operation of the business for more than one year, be of material value, and not be near the\nend of its useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item in the near future. The useful life is\nthe time period over which an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known as fixed assets. It’s\nalso key to note that companies will capitalize a fixed asset if they have material value. A $10 stapler to be\nused in the office, for example, may last for years, but the value of the item is not significant enough to\nwarrant capitalizing it.\nBusinesses typically need many different types of these assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ\nfrom the company’s products. For example, the computers that Apple, Inc. intends to sell are considered\ninventory (a short-term asset), whereas the computers Apple’s employees use for day-to-day operations are\nlong-term assets. In Liam’s case, the new silk screen machine would be considered a long-term tangible asset\nas they plan to use it over many years to help generate revenue for their business. Long-term tangible assets\nare listed as noncurrent assets on a company’s balance sheet. Typically, these assets are listed under the\ncategory of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as fixed assets or plant assets.\nApple, Inc. lists a total of $36.766 million in total Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) on its September 2020\nconsolidated balance sheet (see Figure 4.7).

Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it\nis expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs\nover its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s\nfinancial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in\nexpenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense\nrecognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the\nrevenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over\nthe years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.\nAs stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated\ncosts on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,\nthey will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry in Figure 4.8).\nFigure 4.8 Journal Entry for Machine/Cash\nWhen capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This\nincludes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.\nFor example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the\nland would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.\nOver time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the\nasset.\n3\nIn the Chapter 4 financial statements, a number contained within parentheses is a negative number, such as the “Accumulated",

When a company capitalizes an asset, it records the total cost of acquiring the asset, including any additional costs such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees. When a company expenses an asset, it records the cost of the asset as an expense on the income statement. For example, if a company purchases a piece of equipment for $10,000 and it is expected to be used for 5 years, the company would capitalize the asset and record it on the balance sheet.

The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future.

This is because\nthe expense would have been $5,011.20, and since we cannot depreciate the asset below the estimated\nsalvage value of $10,000, the expense cannot exceed $2,528, which is the amount left to depreciate (difference\nbetween the book value of $12,528 and the salvage value of $10,000).

Under normal circumstances, this might have been considered just\nanother accounting fiasco leading to the end of a company. However, WorldCom controlled a large\npercentage of backbone routes, a major component of the hardware supporting the internet, as even the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission recognized. If such an event were to happen today, it could shut\ndown international commerce and would be considered a national emergency.10 As demonstrated by\nWorldCom, the unethical behavior of a few accountants could have shut down the world’s online\nbusinesses and international commerce.

While\nbusinesses work hard to avoid net loss situations, it is not uncommon for a company to sustain a net loss from\ntime to time. It is difficult, however, for businesses to remain viable while experiencing net losses over the long\nterm.\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function is:\nTo be complete, we must also consider the impact of gains and losses. While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\nProfit versus Cash Flow\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the",

Stakeholders need to know the financial performance (as measured by\nthe income statement—that is, net income or net loss) and financial position (as measured by the balance\nsheet—that is, assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) of the business. This information is provided in the\nincome statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. However, since these financial statements\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing. For\n122\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexample, a customer may buy a good on account. Revenues would be recorded, but cash would not yet be\nreceived. The same is true on the expenses side. An expense can be incurred, such as an electric bill, but cash\nmay not have been paid out yet. Thus, an expense is recorded and recognized on the income statement, but\ncash has not yet been given up. The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net\nincome (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.\n4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\n123\nSummary\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed.

Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual-basis accounting\nan accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\nwhen paid\ncapitalize",

Dividends are commonly in the form of cash, but dividends can be paid out in the form of stock or\nother assets as well.\nTo pay a cash dividend, the firm must have enough cash on hand and sufficient retained earnings. They cannot\npay out a dividend beyond the retained earnings available. Some companies issue shares of stock as a\ndividend rather than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has insufficient cash but wants to\nkeep its investors happy. When a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional shares of stock to\nexisting shareholders.\nA property dividend occurs when the firm pays out dividends in the form of something other than stock or\ncash, often one of their assets or something they hold in inventory. For example, Walt Disney Company may\nchoose to distribute tickets to visit its theme parks. A property dividend may be declared when a company\nwants to reward its investors but doesn’t have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold on to its existing\ncash for other investments.\nRemember, the retained earnings account reflects the cumulative earnings of a firm since they began\nbusiness, less dividends paid out to shareholders. This includes all forms of dividends (cash, stock, and other\nassets). Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares of stock that are outstanding.

It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business.

The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement.

Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash.

They did, however, cause an impact to\ncash flow (see Figure 5.17).\nDuring the current year, Clear Lake purchased an additional $5,000 in short-term investments (see the\ncomparative balances sheets; the balance in that account increased by $5,000 since the prior year).

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task.

A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements.

Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

There are many events that might require reporting. A few key examples include\nchanges to rights of shareholders, changes in control of the company, and amendments to the company\ncharter or bylaws.\nThe quarterly report is much like the annual report already discussed. It contains the firm’s financial\nstatements, required accounting disclosures, statements on internal control, and a management discussion\nand analysis (MD&A) letter. It does not contain an auditor’s report, as firms are not audited on a quarterly\nbasis. Quarterly reports are helpful to investors because they provide information on a timely enough basis to\nbe relevant.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInvestor Relations\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Most financial statements are\nprepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to\narrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other\nnonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.\n5.2 The Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly\ndepict and support the accounting equation:\nA classified balance\nsheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nThe financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is\nneeded in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of\nthe balance sheet.\n5.4 The Statement of Owner’s Equity\nThe statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,",

Beginning balances are provided, and all key\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\nneeds for growth.\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.\n5.8 Reporting Financial Activity\nPublicly traded firms must file company and financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\non a regular basis. Key reports include the quarterly report, called a 10-Q, and the annual report, called a 10-K.\n158\n5 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual basis\naccounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned yet not\nnecessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily when\npaid\nassets",

It differs\ndepending on the role and perspective of those performing the analysis. For example, your personal\naccountant will have different goals and needs in making recommendations to you about your personal\nfinances. All accounting professionals use financial analysis to check for validity, accurate data, compliance in\nreporting, and more.\nSome tactics for managing your personal finances can be the same as for managing business finances. For\nexample, reducing expenses and maximizing returns on long-term investments are always good practices.\nDebt can also be a beneficial tool in both personal and professional finances when used appropriately. Debt is\nneither inherently good nor bad; it simply needs to be properly managed in order to achieve a reasonable\nreturn in exchange for the cost and risk it poses.\nThough the process and tools may be similar, financial analysis from a business perspective has different goals\nand needs. Investors are looking to identify firm performance, financial health, and profitability.

The company should also consider its past experience and how it corresponds to current and\nfuture performance expectations.\nImportance of Ratios and Analysis\nFinancial ratios help internal and external stakeholders make informed decisions about actions like investing,\nbecoming a supplier, making a loan, or altering internal operations, among other things. The information\nresulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success,\nset budget expectations, and compare industry competitors.

The information can show trends over time, which\ncan help in making future business decisions.

It can assist with understanding the makeup of current operations within the\nbusiness and which shifts need to occur internally to increase productivity.\nLimitation of Financial Statement Analysis\nThough useful, it’s important to note that there are limitations to financial statement analysis as well.\nStakeholders need to remember that past performance does not always predict future performance. Economic\ninfluences, such as inflation or a recession, could skew the data being analyzed. Additionally, the way a\ncompany reports information may change over time. For example, there could be changes in where and when\ncertain transactions are recorded, and this may not be immediately evident to financial statement users. It is\nalso key to note that though all publicly traded companies in the United States are required to follow Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), there are many estimates and flexibility in how some standards are\napplied.

In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle.

In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers.

Examples of the most liquid assets include\ncash, accounts receivable, and inventory for merchandising or manufacturing businesses. The reason these\nare among the most liquid assets is that these assets will be turned into cash more quickly than land or\nbuildings, for example. Accounts receivable represents goods or services that have already been sold and will\ntypically be paid/collected within 30 to 45 days.\nInventory is less liquid than accounts receivable because the product must first be sold before it generates\ncash (either through a cash sale or sale on account).

Both the balance\nsheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on\nthe preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares\noutstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\nearnings per share is\nBy removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to\ncommon shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to\npreferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While\na number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\nrequires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount\nappears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\nIn the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per\nshare is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout\nthe year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares\nis used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year\nwith 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period\nJanuary 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were\nissued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the\nnext nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\nfractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).\n6.5 • Market Value Ratios\n177\nFigure 6.6 Weighted Shares\nIf the shares were not weighted, the calculation would not consider the time period during which the shares\nwere outstanding.\nTo illustrate how earnings per share is calculated, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods earns $35,000 in net",

This\nconcept puts forward the idea that a dollar received today is worth more than, and therefore preferable to, a\ndollar received at some point in the future. The three primary reasons for this are that (1) money received now\ncan be saved or invested now and earn interest or a return, resulting in more money in the future; (2) any\npromise of future payments of cash will always carry the risk of default; and (3) it is simple human nature for\npeople to prefer making their purchases of goods and services in the present rather than waiting to make\nthem at some future time.\nFor this reason, it is important to incentivize people to give up their present consumption patterns by offering\nthem greater value in the future. Based on the concept of TVM, it can be said that a dollar was worth more to\nus, and thus carried more value, yesterday than it is to us today. It also then follows that a dollar in our\npossession right now carries a greater value for us than a dollar we might receive tomorrow or at some other\npoint in the future.\nThe entire concept of the time value of money is particularly important because it allows savers and investors\nto make better-informed decisions about what to do with their money. TVM can help a person understand\nwhich option may be best based on the critical factors of overall risk, rates of interest, inflation, and return.",

However, we know that this is not always the\ncase. Sometimes it is simply a better idea to save your money. While inflation can have the effect of making a\ndollar worth less tomorrow than it is worth today, the positive effect of compound interest works in favor of\nsavers and investors.\n7.1\nNow versus Later Concepts\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why time has an impact on the value of money.\n•\nExplain the concepts of future value and present value.\n•\nExplain why lump sum cash flow is the basis for all other cash flows.\nHow and Why the Passage of Time Affects the Value of Money\nThe concept of the time value of money (TVM) is predicated on the fact that it is possible to earn interest\nincome on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or interest-bearing account. As times goes by,\ninterest is earned on amounts you have invested (present value), which effectively means that time will add\nvalue (future value) to your savings. The longer the period of time you have your money invested, the more\ninterest income will accrue. Also, the higher the rate of interest your account or investment is earning, again,\nthe more your money will grow.\nUnderstanding how to calculate values of money in the present and at different points in the future is a key",

In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value\ntomorrow.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will\npay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year\nfrom now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\nturns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is\n$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that\ntime. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the\nprincipal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\nBy taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a\ntotal value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to\n$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that\n$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss\ninterest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can\nconsider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds\nand/or charged to the borrower of these same funds.

This will have the effect of accelerating the growth of the total dollar value of the\naccount.\nThis is the important effect of the compounding of interest: money grows in larger and larger increments the\nlonger you leave it in an interest-bearing account. In effect, the compounding of interest over time accelerates\nthe growth of money.\nIn order to determine the FV of any amount of money, it will always be necessary to know the following pieces\nof information: (1) the principal, initial deposit, or present value (PV); (2) the rate of interest, usually\nexpressed on an annual basis as r; and (3) the number of time periods that the money will remain in the\naccount (n). The interest rate is often referred to as the growth rate, or the annual percentage increase on\nsavings or on an investment. When the rate is raised to the power of the number of periods, the formula\nwill yield a number that is commonly referred to as the future value interest factor (FVIF). As a result\nof this process, as n (time, or the number of periods) increases, the future value interest factor will increase.\nAlso, as r (interest rate) increases, the FVIF will increases. For these reasons, the future value calculation is\ndirectly determined by both the interest rate being used and the total amount of time—specifically, the\nnumber of periods—being considered.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Future Values\nHere’s another example of calculating future values in multiple-period scenarios.",

For these reasons, the future value calculation is\ndirectly determined by both the interest rate being used and the total amount of time—specifically, the\nnumber of periods—being considered.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Future Values\nHere’s another example of calculating future values in multiple-period scenarios.\nOn a recent drive, you spotted your dream home, which is currently listed at $400,000. Unfortunately, you\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\ncost after six years?\nSolution:\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\nvalue of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn\nor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of\nor $105, in the account at the end of one\nyear.\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\nand five?\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n195\nUsing the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:\nHow the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding\nMelvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in\ninterest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future.

Using the\nformula, we can complete the following calculations for him:\nAgain, Melvin likes this information, and he states that he will try to find the highest interest rate available. This\nmakes sense, but it’s important to remember that investments are usually not guaranteed to earn you specific\ninterest rates, or rates of return. Most investments, other than Treasury investments such as Treasury bonds,\ncarry some form of financial risk, either small or large, and the greater the rate of return, the more likely it is\nthat the risk associated with the investment will also be greater.

With the advent and wide acceptance and use of\nfinancial calculators and spreadsheet software, FVIF (and other such time value of money tables and factors)\nhave become obsolete, and we will not discuss them in this text.

This is because most financial calculators\n(and spreadsheets) follow something called the cash flow sign convention, which is a way for calculators and\nspreadsheets to keep the relative direction of the cash flow straight. Positive numbers are used to represent\ncash inflows, and negative numbers should always be used for cash outflows.\nIn this example, the $1,000 is an investment that requires a cash outflow. For this reason, -1000 is entered as\nthe present value, as you will be essentially handing this $1,000 to a bank or to someone else to initiate the\ntransaction. Conversely, the future value represents a cash inflow in four years’ time. This is why the calculator\ngenerates a positive 1,125.51 as the end result of this calculation.\nHad you entered the present value of $1,000 as a positive number, there would have been no real concern, but\nthe ending future value answer would have been returned expressed as a negative number. This would be\ncorrect had you borrowed $1,000 today (cash inflow) and agreed to repay $1,125.51 (cash outflow) four years\nfrom now. Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the -- (minus) key).\nFor example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the +|-\n+|- key instead of the minus key. If you\nenter 1000 and then hit the +|-\n+|- key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.\nAn important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a\nproblem without needing to reenter all of the other data. For example, suppose that we wanted to find out the\nfuture value in our bank account if we left the money from our previous example invested for 20 years instead\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n198\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof 4.

That is exactly how the answer turns\nout, as the calculated required interest rate of approximately 6.19% is just slightly greater than the growth\nrate of 6% used in the previous example. So, based on this, it looks like our answer here passes a simple\n“sanity check” review.\n7.4\nApplications of TVM in Finance\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how the time value of money can impact your personal financial goals.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to inflation.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to financial risk.\n•\nExplain how compounding period frequency affects the time value of money.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet’s say you want to buy a new car next year, and the one you have your eye on should be selling for $20,000\na year from now. How much will you need to put away today at 5% interest to have $20,000 a year from now?\nEssentially, you are trying to determine how much $20,000 one year from now is worth today at 5% interest\nover the year. To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower or discount the future value\nback to the current period.\nThe interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the\ndiscount rate because it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to\nthe annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this\ndiscount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing\nthe FV equation, we can turn\ninto\nwhich is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest\nfactor (PVIF). The PVIF is simply the reciprocal of the FVIF, which makes sense because these factors are doing\nexactly opposite things. Therefore, the amount you need to deposit today to earn $20,000 in one year\nat 5% interest is\nThe Multiple-Period Scenario\nThere will often be situations when you need to determine the present value of a cash flow that is scheduled to\noccur several years in the future (see Figure 7.17).

Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy.

Using\nthe above formula, we have\nSo, the nominal interest rate on the bond amounts to 8.12%, with a real interest rate of 6% within an economy\nthat is experiencing a 2% inflation rate.

It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples",

                    "answer": "The difference between annual compounding and quarterly compounding is that annual compounding occurs once a year, while quarterly compounding occurs four times a year. This means that with quarterly compounding, you will receive interest income more frequently, which can lead to a larger overall return over time."

                    "answer": "The rule of 72 is a simple mathematical formula that can be used to estimate the impact of interest or growth rates. The formula is: 72 / interest or growth rate = number of years required to double a value. For example, if you have an investment that earns 8% interest per year, it will take approximately 9 years (72 / 8 = 9) for the investment to double in value."

Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\nThe idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.\nTVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the\nfuture. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money\nearly can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects\nof inflation. Of course, it is important to remember that there will always be possible options that are sacrificed\nwith every option you decide on and every choice you make.\nKey Terms\nBureau of Labor Statistics\na group within the United States Department of Labor that is the primary fact-",

                    "answer": "The time value of money (TVM) is a basic concept in finance that states that money received in the present is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. The time value of money is used to determine the value of money over time and to make financial decisions, such as investing or borrowing. It is important to consider the time value of money when making financial decisions because it can affect the overall value of an investment or loan. For example, if you invest $1,000 today at a 5% interest rate, you will have $1,050 in one year. However, if you wait another year to invest the same $1,000, you will only have $1,050 in two years, and you will have missed out on the opportunity to earn interest on the money for one year. Therefore, it is important to consider the time value of money when making financial decisions to ensure that you are making the most of your money and maximizing its potential earning capacity."

An old adage in finance claims, “If you aren’t in control of\nyour money, your money is controlling you.” Fortunately, learning to manage your money is not difficult if\nyou’re disciplined and understand some simple techniques. For example, several years ago, the author was\nnegotiating for a three-year auto loan from a well-known regional dealer, who was offering an interest rate of\n2%. When the manager left the room for a few minutes, we pulled out a financial calculator and proved in less\nthan a minute that the actual interest rate in the payments he was proposing was nearly double the quoted\nand advertised rate.\nIn addition to understanding how the loan process works, which improves your negotiation skills when\nborrowing, businesses and individuals can better control their investments by understanding basic rules of\nfinance, particularly as seen in this and the preceding chapter. Assume you pledge to invest $1,000 per year at\n5% return per year and are curious about how much you will have accumulated by age 60. If you begin at age\n30, you will have $69,760; if you begin at age 20, you will have $126,840. Can the extra 10 years make that much\nof a difference? We’ll see that indeed they can, and the calculations required to prove it can take less than two\nminutes.",

Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity?

Assume\nthat we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at the end of each year for five years, earning 7%\ncompounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\ninterest from past periods.\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we\ndeposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the\nbeginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at\nthe end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity.

How much money do we need in our fund today to accomplish this stream of payments if our remaining\nbalance will always be earning 8% annually? Although we’ll gradually deplete the fund as we withdraw\nperiodic payments of the same amount, whatever funds remain in the account will always be earning interest.\n8.2 • Annuities\n231\nBefore we investigate a formula to calculate this amount, we can illustrate the objective: determining the\npresent value of this future stream of payments, either manually or using Microsoft Excel. We can take each of\nthe five payments of $25,000 and discount them to today’s value using the simple present value formula:\nwhere FV is the future value, PV is the present value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nFor example, the first $25,000 is discounted by the equation as follows:\nProof that $23,148.15 will grow to $25,000 in one year at 8% interest:\nIf we use this same method for each of the five years, increasing the exponent n for each year, we see the\nresult in Table 8.2.\nYear\nCalculation\nResult\n1\n$23,148.15\n2\n$21,433.47\n3\n$19,846.81\n4\n$18,375.75\n5\n$17,014.58\nTOTAL\n$99,818.76\nTable 8.2 Present Value of Future Payments\nWe begin with the amount calculated in our table, $99,818.76. Before any money is withdrawn, a year’s worth\nof interest at 8% is compounded and added to our balance. Then our first $25,000 is withdrawn, leaving us\nwith $82,804.26. This process continues until the end of five years, when, aside from a minor rounding\ndifference, the fund has “done its job” and is equal to zero. However, we can make this simpler. Because each\npayment withdrawn (or added, as we will see later) is the same, we can calculate the present value of an\nannuity in one step using an equation. Rather than the multiple steps above, we will use the following\nequation:\nwhere PVa is the present value of the annuity and PYMT is the amount of one payment.\nIn this example, PYMT is $25,000 at the end of each of five years. Note that the greater the number of periods\nand/or the size of the amount borrowed, the greater the chances of large rounding errors.

It’s important to note that rounding differences can\nbecome significant when dealing with larger multipliers, as in the financing of a multimillion-dollar machine or\nfacility. In this text, we will ignore them.\nIn conclusion, five payments of $25,000, or $125,000 in total, can be funded today with $99,817.81, with the\ndifference being obtained from interest always accumulating on the remaining balance at 8%. The running\nbalance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and\nsubtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year. In the last (fifth) year, just enough\ninterest will accrue to bring the balance to the $25,000 needed to complete the fifth payment.\nA common use of the PVa is with large-money lotteries. Let’s assume you win the North Dakota Lottery for\n$1.2 million, and they offer you $120,000 per year for 10 years, beginning one year from today. We will ignore\ntaxes and other nonmathematical considerations throughout these discussions and problems. The Lottery\nCommission will likely contact you with an alternative: would you like to accept that stream of payments … or\nwould you like to accept a lump sum of $787,000 right now instead? Can you complete a money-based\nanalysis of these alternatives? Based purely on the dollars, no, you cannot. The reason is that you can’t\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\nmoney. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives\non the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission",

That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as\ntaxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.\n8.2 • Annuities\n233\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nEarlier, we defined an ordinary annuity. A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,",

These are available on the basis of personal credit scores, with data\nbeing supplied by the three best-known credit reporting firms: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.\nIndividuals should check their scores with each of these companies at least once per year, which they can\ndo for no charge.

Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance.

What will the amount of\nyour monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s\nprove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of\nan annuity formula. Remember that you are not financing the entire $200,000 purchase; you pay $60,000 in\ncash, so you are only financing the remaining $140,000.\nWe modify the periods from years to months by multiplying by 12, and we modify the annual rate to a monthly\nrate by dividing by 12, resulting in\nBy substitution into the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe divide both sides by 170.907667 to isolate the payment amount (PYMT):",

These loans allow you to\ndetermine your April 15 personal income tax liability through a preparer and receive an advance against\nyour expected refund.2 But beware: your ability to analyze the true cost of money is always critical. Like all\nloans, RALs bear a rate of interest. Let’s assume that the firm that prepared your tax return determines that\nyou’re entitled to an $800 refund. Once they advance that amount to you, it will bear interest at a certain\nrate; we’ll assume 0.5% per week. You might expect a tax refund in four weeks. Half a percent of $800\ndoesn’t sound like much, but what happens when you annualize it into an effective rate, assuming your tax\nrefund arrives exactly four weeks from when you accept the loan? Assume no compounding during those\nfour weeks.\nSolution:\nA weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use\nof $800. Of course, that totals 2% of the amount advanced. There are 13 four-week periods in a year, so\neven though the interest rate appears to be small, it amounts to 26% when annualized!

You will draw $25,000 at the end of\neach year for five years from a fund earning 8% annually, and you want to know how much you need in that\nfund today to accomplish this. We accomplish this in Excel easily with the PV function. The format of the PV\ncommand is\n=PV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nOnly the first three arguments inside the parentheses are used. We’ll place them in cells and refer to those\ncells in our PV function. As an option, you could also type the numbers into the parentheses directly. Notice\nthe slight rounding error because of decimal expansion. Also, the payment must be entered as a negative\nnumber for your result to be positive; this can be accomplished either by making the $25,000 in cell B5 a\nnegative amount or by placing a minus sign in front of the B5 in the formula’s arguments. In cell B3, you must\nenter the percent either as 0.08 or as 8% (with the percent sign). We repeated the formula syntax and the\nactual formula inputs in column A near the result, for your reference (see Figure 8.3).\nFigure 8.3 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nWe also found the present value of an annuity due. We use the same information from the ordinary annuity\nproblem above, but you will recall that the first of five payments happens immediately at the start of year 1,\nnot at the end. We follow the same procedures and inputs as in the previous example, but with one change to\nthe PV function: the last argument in the parentheses will change from 0 to 1. This is a toggle switch that\ncommands the PV function to treat this as an annuity due instead of an ordinary annuity (see Figure 8.4).\n250\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.4 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nSection 8.2 introduced us to future values.

Second, the actual effect function\nin C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the word rate because we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so\nExcel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9, rate\nremains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.\nTo assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the\nanchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we\nuse the name rate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place\nthe cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the\ncurrent cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then\nhit the enter key, the value in that box will change to rate.

We will begin with a\npersonal example. You win a cash windfall through your state’s lottery. You would like to take a portion of the\nfunds and place them in a fixed investment so that you can draw $17,000 per year starting one year from now\nand continue to do so for the next two years. At the end of year 4, you want to withdraw $17,500, and at the\nend of year 5, you will withdraw the last $18,000 to close the account. When you take your last payment of\n$18,000, your fund will be totally depleted. You will always be earning 6% annually. How much of your cash\nwindfall should you set aside today to accomplish this?\nLet us break down the problem, remembering that we are thinking in reverse from the earlier problems that\ninvolved future values. In this case, we’re bringing future values back in time to find their present values. You\nwill recall that this process is called discounting rather than compounding.\nRegardless of how we solve this, the question remains the same: How much money must we invest today\n(present value) to achieve this? And remember that we will always be earning 6% compounded annually on\nany invested balances.\n9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows\n267\nWe are calculating present values as we did in previous chapters, given a known future value “target,” in order\nto determine how much money you need today to achieve that goal.

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions.

Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•",

This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nannually. However, if a bond pays interest on a semiannual or quarterly basis, the coupon rate will have to\nbe divided by 2 or 4, respectively, to convert the stated annual rate to the correct periodic rate. In our\nexample, coupons are paid annually, so the periodic or annual interest that is paid is equal to\n. You may notice that because these payments are the same amount and made at\nregular intervals, they constitute an annuity stream (refer to Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple\nPayments.\n•\nMaturity date: The maturity date is the expiration date of the bond, or the point in time when the term of\na bond comes to an end. On the maturity date, the issuer will make the final interest or coupon payment\non the bond and will also pay off its principal, or face value. In our example, the maturity date is at the end\nof the 20-year period.\n•\nYield to maturity (YTM): The YTM is essentially the discount rate used to bring the future cash flows of a\nbond into present value terms.

The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate. Rates for floating-rate bonds are typically tied to a benchmark interest rate that exists in the\neconomy.

While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,",

The annual payments continue for 15 years, with the last payment being\nmade on September 19, 2026. At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments\nconstitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.\nThe principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount\nis a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.\nIn Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments. For now, we\nwill jump to the answer and simply use the YTM of 1.24% from the bond data in Table 10.1. Later in the\nchapter, we will develop the concepts behind how an appropriate discount rate is determined.\nFor Step 3, we now apply two equations to the set of future cash flows from the bond. This will then provide us\nwith the present values of these cash flows, or the expected present-day value of the bond. Because we know\nthat the coupon payments constitute an annuity stream, we can use the equation for the present value of an\nannuity (discussed in Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments.

So, by combining these, we will\nhave the present value of the coupon payment stream, or\nSo, for our example above, this becomes\nNext, we need to determine the present value of the payment of the par or face value of the bond at maturity.\nThis is calculated as follows:\nInserting our values into this formula gives us\nAdding the present values of the two payment streams gives us",

This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\ncompared to stocks.\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n291\nWhile yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are\ncurrently low because the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) has kept interest rates low for several years,\ninvestors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.2 This is especially true as investors enter their\nretirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks.

The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-",

Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a\nnegative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but",

The most common and best-known\nrisks are interest rate risk and default risk, but other risks exist that should be understood. Among these\nrisks are the following:\n•\nCredit risk. If investors believe that a bond issuer is unlikely to meet its payment commitments, they may\ndemand a higher yield to purchase the bond issue in the first place. Due to the relative stability of\ngovernments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.\n•\nLiquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\n•\nDuration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n301\n•\nCall risk and reinvestment risk.

This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings.

Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on.

The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders.

In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated\ncoupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.\nWe have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest\nrates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes",

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call",

However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by\ncompanies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate\nincome and eventual value for individual investors.\nWith common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will\nreceive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•",

One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as\nwhether a stock that has a ratio of\nis a good buy at its current price or if a stock with a P/E ratio of\nis\ntoo expensive, without performing any relevant comparisons or further analysis.\nAnalysts have many different ways to interpret P/E ratio data. One of the most common interpretations is that\nfirms with high P/E ratios should be growth companies. Also, a high P/E ratio could mean that a stock’s price is\nhigh relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. This could signal a possible undesired downward\nadjustment in market price in the future.\nWe can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be\nstabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to\nearnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential\ninvestment gains through stock price appreciation.\nWhile this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution\nmust always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,\nwhich would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term.

When such complex\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses.

Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their\ncommon stock:\nEV/Revenue (EV/R). Also called EV/Sales, EV/R is a valuation metric used to understand a company’s total\nvaluation compared to its annual sales levels. EV/R can help provide an analyst with an idea of exactly how\nmuch investors pay for every dollar of a company’s sales revenue.\nEV/R is considered a relatively crude metric but can be useful when analyzing companies that have different\nmethods of revenue recognition. P/E ratios, for example, can be significantly affected by changes in the\naccounting policies of companies being evaluated. This is another reason why multiple metrics should be used\nin valuations.\nAdditionally, EV/R is a useful measure for companies that are consuming cash or experiencing financial losses.\nSuch companies may be start-ups or emerging technology firms that have not fully matured and are still in a\ngrowth stage of development.\nEV/EBIT.

Using the stock’s price, a required rate of return, and the value\nof the next year’s dividend, investors can determine a stock’s value based on the total present value of future\ndividends.\nThis means that if an investor is buying a stock primarily based on its dividend, the DDM can be a useful tool to\ndetermine exactly how much of the stock’s price is supported by future dividends.

As companies change and grow, dividend policies will change, and it naturally follows that the\npayout of dividends will also change. This is why it is important to become familiar with other DDMs that may\nbe more practical in their use.\nConstant Growth Dividend Discount Model\nAs indicated by its name, the constant growth DDM assumes that a stock’s dividend payments will grow at a\nfixed annual percentage that will remain the same throughout the period of time they are held by an investor.\nWhile the constant growth DDM may be more realistic than the zero growth DDM in allowing for dividend\ngrowth, it assumes that dividends grow by the same specific percentage each year. This is also an unrealistic\nassumption that can present problems when attempting to evaluate companies such as Amazon, Facebook,\nGoogle, or other organizations that do not pay dividends. Constant growth models are most often used to\nvalue mature companies whose dividend payments have steadily increased over a significant period of time.\nWhen applied, the constant growth DDM will generate the present value of an infinite stream of dividends that\nare growing at a constant rate.\nThe constant growth DDM formula is\nwhere D0 is the value of the dividend received this year, D1 is the value of the dividend to be received next\nyear, g is the growth rate of the dividend, and r is the required rate of return.\nAs can be seen above, after simplification, the constant growth DDM formula becomes the Gordon growth\nmodel formula and works in the same way.

Many analysts like to use the\ntwo-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable\nassumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level\nof, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will\nmaintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of\ndividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.\nAs we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:\n•\nThe first period analyzed will be one of high initial growth.\n•\nThis stage of higher growth will eventually transition into a period of more mature, stable, and sustainable\ngrowth at a lower rate than the initial high-growth period.\n•\nThe dividend payout ratio will be based on company performance and the expected growth rate of its\noperations.\nLet’s use an example. Lore Ltd. estimates that its dividend growth will be 13% per year for the next five years.\nIt will then settle to a sustainable, constant, and continuing rate of 5%.

Also,\nbecause the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or\nsubjectivity.

Rather, they may manipulate dividend payments in the interest of buoying\nup their stock price.\nTo further illustrate limitations of DDMs, let’s examine the Concepts in Practice case.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nLimitations of DDMs\nA major limitation of the dividend discount model is that it cannot be used to value companies that do not\npay dividends. This is becoming a growing trend, particularly for young high-tech companies. Warren\nBuffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has stated that companies are usually better off if they take their\nexcess funds and reinvest them into infrastructure, evolving technologies, and other profitable ventures.\nThe payment of dividends to shareholders is “almost a last resort for corporate management,”1 says\nBuffett, and cash balances should be invested in “projects to become more efficient, expand territorially,\nextend and improve product lines or . . . otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from\nits competitors.”2 Berkshire follows this practice of reinvesting cash rather than paying dividends, as do",

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model.

The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\n11.4 Preferred Stock\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, there is no maturity date, and consequently, there\nis no final payment of the par value. The term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past\n(if cumulative) and present dividends before common shareholders receive any cash dividends.\n11.5 Efficient Markets\nEfficient markets are markets in which costs are minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. There\nare two forms of efficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency. Operational efficiency concerns\nthe speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available price. Informational efficiency\nconcerns how quickly a source reflects comprehensive information in the available trading prices. Financial",

Money market securities are available in smaller amounts if you choose to invest\nin money market mutual funds (MMMFs) or certain types of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nTreasury bills (T-bills) are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, with maturities of 4, 8, 13, or 26 weeks. The Treasury also auctions 52-week T-bills once every four\nweeks. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount.

Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\n354\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-",

The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the\nFederal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not\nrequired to keep reserves with the Fed. In addition, the Fed now pays interest to commercial banks for\nreserves held at the Federal Reserve banks. Paying interest on reserves reduces the incentive for domestic\ncommercial banks to enter the federal funds market since they can already earn interest on their excess\nreserves.\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n355\nDaily trading volume in the federal funds market from 2016 through 2020 ranged from a high of $115 billion in\nMarch of 2018 to a low of only $34 billion on December 31, 2020.2 The volume of federal funds activity is lower\nin periods of slower economic growth because banks have fewer good opportunities to issue loans and are\nless likely to be short of required reserves.\nBond Markets\nBond markets are financial markets that make payments to investors for a specific period of time. Investors\ndecide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expect inflation to affect the value of the\nfixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\nGovernment Bond Markets\nIn the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities\nin the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.\nWe learned in Bonds and Bond Valuation that the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to\nraise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,\nas the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.\nThe debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online at https://www.usdebtclock.org/\n(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).\nTreasury notes (T-notes) are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years.

T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\nexplicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and\ninstitutional investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are popular investment vehicles for many types of\ngovernment T-bill, T-note, and T-bond portfolios. An ETF is a basket of securities that can trade like stocks on a\nstock exchange. For example, IEI is an iShares ETF managed by BlackRock that invests in Treasury securities\nwith three to seven years to maturity. When investors buy this ETF, they purchase a small bundle of Treasury\nnotes that they can buy or sell, just as if they owned an individual share of stock. ETFs are a convenient way for\ninvestors to own broad portfolios of securities while still being able to trade the whole group in a single\ntransaction if they choose.\n2\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York. “Effective Federal Funds Rate.” Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\n356\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.2 Daily Trading Volume for US Treasury Notes and Bonds (data source: treasurydirect.gov)",

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and\nessentially merge with the target. Underpricing of IPOs is well documented,12 and the owners of a private\ncompany going public do not capture the significant increase in stock price that frequently occurs in the\nmonths following an IPO.\nA SPAC offering allows the private firm owners to negotiate for a better price. A July 2020 study from\nRenaissance Capital reports that “of 223 SPAC IPOs conducted from the start of 2015 through July 2020, 89\nhave completed mergers and taken a company public.” According to the study, of those 89 mergers, “the\ncommon shares have delivered an average loss of 18.8% and a median return of minus 36.1%. That compares\nwith the average after-market return from traditional IPOs of 37.2%” over the same time period.13\nSequence of Trade Execution\nInvestors who wish to trade stocks (buy or sell) execute trades via a broker.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown.

In over 40 years of investing in bonds and other types of fixed-\nincome securities worldwide, Bill Gross earned his moniker “the bond king.”\nIn 1971, Gross cofounded and began his long tenure as managing director and chief investment officer of\nPacific Investment Management Company, better known as Pimco. Gross was not yet 30 years old, but he\nhad already graduated from college, served in the Navy in Vietnam, and even briefly worked as a\nprofessional blackjack player in Las Vegas to bankroll the cost of his MBA from UCLA.\nGross helped change the definition of success for bond investors by focusing on total returns, including\nprice changes, rather than simply bond yields. He used mathematical modeling and invested worldwide\nand in different types of bond markets seeking risk-adjusted returns. Gross made active rather than passive\nmanagement of bond funds a successful investment strategy.

In addition, Gross profited\nfrom his investment prowess, amassing a fortune in excess of $2 billion.\nGross’s investment strategy was to carefully analyze the known factors about debt instruments and pair\nthat analysis with the unknown future. He was uncanny in his ability to estimate future prices, interest\nrates, and macroeconomic conditions to make profitable investments.\nHowever, as efficient markets would posit, the odds began to catch up with Gross in the latter part of his\ninvesting career. After leaving Pimco in 2014, Gross was unable to match his earlier performance successes\nand failed to beat bond fund performance averages. Much of Gross’s investment strategy allowed him to\nlook for bond returns by investing in any type of bond, with any maturity, in any country, and in any\nlocation. For decades, he was right more often than wrong in his investment choices. However, statistically,\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\n369\nhis approach to investing suggested that, unless he could see the future, at some point his expectations\nwould be incorrect. Perhaps Gross’s greatest competition comes from a generation of investment\nmanagers who learned and improved upon his proven strategies. He retired as an active public fund\nmanager in 2019.\nToday, Gross continues to manage his personal fortune, as well as the assets in his family charitable\nfoundation. Gross and the foundation have donated over $800 million to several causes over the last two\ndecades. In 2020, Gross joined Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and hundreds of other billionaires in signing the\nGiving Pledge, whose signees promise to donate over 50% of their wealth during their lifetime and/or upon\ntheir death.\n(Sources: Mary Childs. “Bill Gross Made the Bond Market What It Is Today.” Barron’s.

Both indices\ntrack the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation. A lower standard deviation of returns suggests less uncertainty of\nreturns and therefore less risk.\nCapital market history demonstrates that the average return to stocks has significantly outperformed other\nfinancial security classes, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or the money market.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies.

When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If\nyou’re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.”\nBuffett has begun the process to give away most of his fortune, but he has left this pearl of wisdom for his\nown children: “A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do\nnothing.”\n(Sources: Joshua Kennon. “How Warren Buffett Became One of the Wealthiest People in America.” The\nBalance.

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\nStocks have produced the greatest average annual rates of return of the money and capital market assets\ndiscussed in this chapter. Stockholders bear more risk than bondholders or money market investors and\nreceive on average higher average annual returns. Despite the relatively high average annual rate of return for\nportfolios of stock, history shows that the equity markets earn negative annual returns about 25% of the time.\nThe negative returns realized by equities occur far more often than the negative results realized by money\nmarket or debt market instruments.\nKey Terms\nbond returns\nsums the periodic interest payments and the change in bond price in a given period and\ndivides by the bond price at the beginning of the period\ncommercial paper (CP)\na short-term, unsecured security issued by corporations and financial institutions to\nmeet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables\ndebenture\na common type of unsecured bond issued by a corporation\nindenture\nlegal term for a bond contract\ninflation",

Univariate data refers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute, such\nas salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\nseveral types of graphs, such as bar graphs, time series graphs, and so on.\nThe most effective type of graph to use for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the data and the\npurpose of the graph. For example, a time series graph is typically used to show how a measurement is\nchanging over time and to identify patterns or trends over time.\nBelow are some examples of typical applications for various graphs and displays.\nGraphs used to show the distribution of data:\n•\nBar chart: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for categorical data\n•\nHistogram: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for continuous data\nGraphs used to show relationships between data points:\n•\nTime series graph: used to show measurement data plotted against time, where time is displayed on the\nhorizontal axis\n•\nScatter plot: used to show the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable\nBar Graphs\nA bar graph consists of bars that are separated from each other and compare percentages. The bars can be\nrectangles, or they can be rectangular boxes (used in three-dimensional plots), and they can be vertical or\nhorizontal. The bar graph shown in the example below has age groups represented on the x-axis and\nproportions on the y-axis.\nBy the end of 2021, a certain social media site had over 146 million users in the United States.

One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb\nis to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more.\nA histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The\nhorizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The\nvertical axis is labeled either Frequency or Relative Frequency (or Percent Frequency or Probability). The graph\nwill have the same shape regardless of the label on the vertical axis. A histogram, like a stem-and-leaf plot, can\ngive you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data.\nThe relative frequency is equal to the frequency of an observed data value divided by the total number of data\nvalues in the sample. Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times a solution occurs. Relative\nfrequency is calculated using the formula\nwhere f = frequency, n = the total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and RF =\nrelative frequency.\nTo construct a histogram, first decide how many bars or intervals, also called classes, will represent the data.\nMany histograms consist of 5 to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose\na starting point for the first interval that is less than the smallest data value. A convenient starting point is a\nlower value carried out to one more decimal place than the value with the most decimal places. For example, if",

One feature of the data\nthat we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that\nyear, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a\nchronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as\nthe decade progresses is called a time series graph.\nTo construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard\nCartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is\nused to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph\ncorrespond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by\nstraight lines in the order in which they occur.\nExample: The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years. We need to construct a time series graph\nfor the (rounded) annual CPI data (see Table 13.12).

The setup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other\nvariable is plotted on the vertical axis. Then each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the\nvarious points are plotted on the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns\nor trends. Additional statistical analysis can be conducted to determine if there is a correlation or other\nstatistically significant relationship between the two variables.\nAssume we are interested in tracking the closing price of Nike stock over the one-year time period from April\n2020 to March 2021.

For example, we may be interested\nto know if there is a correlation between bond prices and interest rates or between the age of a car and the\nvalue of the car. To investigate the correlation between two numeric quantities, the first step is to create a\nscatter plot that will graph the (x, y) ordered pairs. The independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the\nx-variable, and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as the y-variable.\nFor example, we may be interested to know if the price of Nike stock is correlated with the value of the S&P 500\n(Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index). To investigate this, monthly data can be collected for Nike stock\nprices and value of the S&P 500 for a period of time, and a scatter plot can be created and examined. A scatter\nplot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two variables. The\nsetup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted\non the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted\non the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter\ndiagram. Table 14.1 shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year\ntime period.\nTo assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine\nif a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a\nnegative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent\nvariable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to\ndecrease (the two quantities move in the same direction). A negative correlation indicates that as the",

We want to use this best-fit line for the sample as an estimate of the best-fit line for the population\n(Figure 14.5). Examining the scatter plot and testing the significance of the correlation coefficient helps us\ndetermine if it is appropriate to do this.\nThese are the assumptions underlying the test of significance:\n1.\nThere is a linear relationship in the population that models the average value of y for varying values of x.\nIn other words, the expected value of y for each particular value lies on a straight line in the population.\n(We do not know the equation for the line for the population. Our regression line from the sample is our\nbest estimate of this line in the population.)\n2.\nThe y-values for any particular x-value are normally distributed about the line.

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval.

There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation. As the value of x gets further and further from the (x, y) point\ncorresponding to the mean value of x and the mean value of y, the width of the estimated interval around the\npoint estimate increases.

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year. When we are looking at the historical\ndescription of the distribution of returns and want to predict what to expect in a particular year, the arithmetic\naverage is the relevant calculation.\nMeasuring Risk\nAlthough the arithmetic average return for Delta Airlines (DAL) for 2011–2020 was 22.4%, there is not a year in\nwhich the return was exactly 22.4%. In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.\nLooking at the yearly returns in Table 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL.

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy.

During the first\nyear, Sam’s expects to see a $2,000 benefit from purchasing the machine, but this means that after one year,\nthe company will have spent $14,000 more than it has made from the project.

First, the NPV\nmethod uses the time value of money concept. All of the cash flows are discounted back to their present value\nto be compared. Second, the NPV method provides a clear decision criterion. Projects with a positive NPV\nshould be accepted, and projects with a negative NPV should be rejected.

Instead of using the company’s cost of attracting funds for the discount rate and solving for NPV, as we\ndid in the first NPV equation, we set NPV equal to zero and solve for the discount rate to find the IRR:\nThe IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV profile graph crosses the horizontal axis. If the IRR is greater\nthan the cost of capital, a project should be accepted. If the IRR is less than the cost of capital, a project should\nbe rejected. The NPV profile graph for the embroidery machine crossed the horizontal axis at 14%. Therefore,\nif Sam’s Sporting Goods can attract capital for less than 14%, the IRR exceeds the cost of capital and the\nembroidery machine should be purchased.

The IRR assumes that the cash flows are reinvested at the internal rate of\nreturn when they are received. This is a disadvantage of the IRR method. The firm may not be able to find any\nother projects with returns equal to a high-IRR project, so the company may not be able to reinvest at the IRR.\nThe reinvestment rate assumption becomes problematic when a company has several acceptable projects and\nis attempting to rank the projects. We will look more closely at the issues that can arise when considering\nmutually exclusive projects later in this chapter. If a company is simply deciding whether to accept a single\nproject, the reinvestment assumption limitation is not relevant.\nOverlooking Differences in Scale. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method to choose among various\nacceptable projects is that it ignores differences in scale. The IRR converts the cash flows to percentages and\nignores differences in the size or scale of projects. Issues that occur when comparing projects of different\nscales are covered later in this chapter.\n16.4\nAlternative Methods\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate profitability index.\n•\nCalculate discounted payback period.\n•\nCalculate modified internal rate of return.\nProfitability Index (PI)\nThe profitability index (PI) uses the same inputs as the NPV calculation, but it converts the results to a ratio.\nThe numerator is the present value of the benefits of doing a project.

The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from\nbest to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.\nDiscounted Payback Period\nThe payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the\nfact that it ignores the time value of money. The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\ndetermine the payback period.\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback\nperiod does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00)\n2,000.00\n4,000.00\n5,000.00\n5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\nDiscounted Cash Flow ($)\n(16,000)\n1,834.86\n3,366.72\n3,860.92\n3,542.13 3,249.66 2,981.34\nCumulative Discounted\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00) (14,165.14) (10,798.42) (6,937.50) (3,395.37) (145.72) 2,835.62\nTable 16.9\nWhen the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.\nThe discounted payback period would be\nyears.

The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\nestimate of what it expects.\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\nby the end of April.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReducing Capital Spending\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The cash inflow is expected to\nincrease by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in year 7, the final year of the project. You know\nthat your company’s cost of funds is 9%. Your company would like to evaluate this project.\nCalculating NPV Using Excel\nTo calculate NPV using Excel, you would begin by placing each year’s expected cash flows in a sheet, as in row\n5 in Figure 16.4. One approach to calculating NPV is to use the formula for discounting future cash flows, as is\nshown in row 6.\nFigure 16.4 Inserting Present Cash Flows Using Excel ($ except Cost of Funds)",

The\nExcel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period 1 through\nthe end of the project using the designated discount rate, but it fails to include the initial investment at time\n496\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nperiod zero at the beginning of the project. The NPV function in cell J6 will return $56,947 for this project. You\nmust subtract the initial cash outflow of $30,000 that occurs at time 0 to get the NPV of $26,947 for the project.\nWhen entering the Excel-programmed NPV function, you must remember to include references only to the\ncells that contain cash flows from year 1 to the end of the project. Then, subtract the initial investment of year\n0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV—the present values of the cash inflows minus\nthe present value of the cash outflow. Note: Because of the nonstandard use of the term NPV by Excel, many\nusers prefer to use the method described above rather than this predefined function.\nFigure 16.6 NPV Formula ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nCalculating IRR Using Excel\nExcel also provide a function for calculating IRR. This function is shown in Figure 16.7, cell J8. The IRR function\nproperly uses all the project’s cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at time 0, in its calculation, unlike\nthe NPV function.

It is the time it takes the company to recoup its\ninitial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\nNPV is negative.\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\n16.4 Alternative Methods\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered.

If a firm will produce shirts, for\nexample, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to\nstore its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These\nitems the company needs to conduct its operations are assets. They appear on the left-hand side of the\nbalance sheet.\nThe company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets\nappear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent its capital.\nThere are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).\nFigure 17.2 is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet\nmust be\n. Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling\nownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders). The debt that a firm uses is\noften referred to as financial leverage. The relative proportions of debt and equity that a firm uses in\nfinancing its assets is referred to as its capital structure.\nFigure 17.2 Basic Balance Sheet for Company with Debt, Preferred Stock, and Common Equity in Capital Structure\nAttracting Capital\nWhen a company raises money from investors, those investors forgo the opportunity to invest that money\nelsewhere.

In economics terms, there is an opportunity cost to those who buy a company’s bonds or stock.\nSuppose, for example, that you have $5,000, and you purchase Tesla stock. You could have purchased Apple\nstock or Disney stock instead. There were many other options, but once you chose Tesla stock, you no longer\nhad the money available for the other options. You would only purchase Tesla stock if you thought that you\nwould receive a return as large as you would have for the same level of risk on the other investments.\nFrom Tesla’s perspective, this means that the company can only attract your capital if it offers an expected\nreturn high enough for you to choose it as the company that will use your money. Providing a return equal to\nwhat potential investors could expect to earn elsewhere for a similar risk is the cost a company bears in\nexchange for obtaining funds from investors. Just as a firm must consider the costs of electricity, raw\nmaterials, and wages when it calculates the costs of doing business, it must also consider the cost of attracting\ncapital so that it can purchase its assets.\nWeights in the Capital Structure\nMost companies have multiple sources of capital. The firm’s overall cost of capital is a weighted average of its\n508\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndebt and equity costs of capital. The average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted by the\nfractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity, is known as the weighted average cost of\ncapital (WACC).\nThe weights in the WACC are the proportions of debt and equity used in the firm’s capital structure. If, for\nexample, a company is financed 25% by debt and 75% by equity, the weights in the WACC would be 25% on the\ndebt cost of capital and 75% on the equity cost of capital. The balance sheet of the company would look like\nFigure 17.3.\nThese weights can be derived from the right-hand side of a market-value-based balance sheet. Recall that\naccounting-based book values listed on traditional financial statements reflect historical costs. The market-\nvalue balance sheet is similar to the accounting balance sheet, but all values are current market values.\nFigure 17.3 Balance Sheet of Company with Capital Structure of 25% Debt and 75% Equity\nJust as the accounting balance sheet must balance, the market-value balance sheet must balance:",

However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be",

To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\nequity in the capital structure:\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases.

Common shareholders cannot receive any dividends until preferred\ndividends are paid, and in some cases, preferred shareholders receive voting rights until they are paid the\ndividends that are due.

The company must finance 100% of its assets.\nIssuing New Common Stock\nAn existing firm can acquire equity capital to expand its assets in two ways: the retention of earnings or the\nsale of new shares of stock. Thus far in the chapter, the cost of equity capital calculations have assumed that\nthe earnings were being retained for equity capital financing.\nThe net income that is left after all expenses are paid is the residual income that belongs to the shareholders.\nInstead of receiving a fixed payment for letting the firm use their capital (like bondholders who receive fixed\ninterest payments), the reward to shareholders for letting the company use their capital varies from year to\nyear. In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth.

The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are\nrequiring to lend money to the company. Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the\ncompany is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must\nestimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend\ngrowth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n17.3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nCalculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the formula\nRemember that the WACC is an estimate; different methods of estimating the cost of equity capital can lead to\ndifferent estimations of WACC.\n17.4 Capital Structure Choices\nAn unlevered firm uses no debt in its capital structure. A levered firm uses both debt and equity in its capital\nstructure. In perfect financial markets, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the firm’s decision\nto use leverage. With the tax deductibility of interest expenses, however, the value of the firm can increase\nthrough the use of debt. As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.\n17.5 Optimal Capital Structure\nA company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also",

Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt\nequals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.\n17.6 Alternative Sources of Funds\nPreferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over\ncommon stockholders in the order of claimants. A fixed dividend is paid to preferred shareholders and must\nbe paid before common shareholders receive dividends.

This is called forecasting. Accounting and finance professionals use past performance\nalong with what they know about the business, its competitors, the economy, and the company’s plans for the\nfuture to assemble detailed financial forecasts. Forecasts are useful to many individuals for different reasons.\nA budget, a type of static forecast, helps accountants and managers see how their plans for the coming year\ncan be achieved. It outlines sales targets and how much can be spent on cost of goods sold and expenses to\nachieve the company’s bottom-line (net income) targets. Investors use financial forecasts to help guide their\ndecisions to buy, sell or hold stocks or to estimate future potential income through dividends. Perhaps most\nimportantly, for our purposes in finance, forecasts are used to help predict and manage cash flows.\nA business can have all the profit in the world at the end of the year, but if it doesn’t raise enough cash\n(liquidity) to pay the bills and pay its employees halfway through the year, it could still go bankrupt despite\nbeing profitable. Forecasting sales and expenses helps assemble a cash forecast—when sales will be collected\nand when expenses will be paid—so that financial managers can look forward far enough to have enough time\nto react accordingly and secure short- or long-term financing to meet gaps in cash flow.\nFinancial Forecasting\n18\n18 • Why It Matters\n535\n18.1\nThe Importance of Forecasting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss how to use financial statements in forecasting firm financials.\n•\nExplain why balance sheet items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\n•\nExplain why income statement items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\nIn this section, we will briefly review some of the basic elements of financial statements and how we can",

Financial forecasting is important to short-\nand long-term firm success. It helps a firm plan for the resources it will need, ensuring it will have enough cash\non hand at the right time to cover daily operations and capital expenditures. It helps the firm communicate its\nfuture potential and manage its shareholders’ expectations. It also helps management assess future risk and\nset plans in place to mitigate that risk.\nFinancial forecasting involves using historical data, analysis tools, and other information we can gather to\nmake an educated guess about the future financial performance of the firm. Historical figures provide a\nreasonable starting point. We use tools such as ratios, common size, and trend analysis to fine-tune our\nforecast. And finally, we assess what we know about the firm, its competitors, the economy, and anything else\nthat might impact performance and further fine-tune our forecast from there.\nIt’s important to take a moment to consider the role of ethics in forecasting. Ethics is a huge issue in the world\nof accounting and finance in general, and forecasting is no different. There can be tremendous pressure on\nmanagement to perform, to deliver certain levels of profit, and to meet shareholder expectations.\nForecasting, as you will learn throughout this chapter, is not an exact science. There is a great deal of\nsubjectivity that can come into play when forecasting sales and expenses. Ethical behavior is crucial in this\narea. Those who create forecasts must have a firm understanding of where their data comes from, how\nreliable it is, and whether or not their assumptions and projections are reasonably justified.\nFinancial Statement Foundations\nIn Financial Statements, you were introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods. You learned about\nthe four key financial statements: the income statement, balance sheet, statement of stockholders’\nequity, and statement of cash flows.

The statement of\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n537\ncash flows is broken down into three key categories: operating, investing, and financing. This allows users to\nclearly see what elements of the business are generating or using cash. In Figure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake\nhad cash flow from operating activities of $53,600, cash used for investing activities of ($18,600), and cash\nused for financing activities of ($15,000).\nFigure 18.4 Statement of Cash Flows\nAnother key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is\nnecessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance. This means that total assets\n(what the company owns) must equal total liabilities and equity (what the company owes).\n538\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis. To prepare a common-size analysis of the\nbalance sheet, every item on the statement must be expressed as a percentage of total assets. Seeing each\nitem as a percentage—that is, seeing its relationship to total assets—is also helpful for assessing historical\nstatements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.\nFor example, in Figure 18.5, you can see that Clear Lake’s current assets represented 80% of its total assets in\nboth the current and prior years.\nFigure 18.5 Common-Size Balance Sheet\nIncome Statement Analysis\nLike balance sheet analysis, income statement analysis is also quite helpful in preparing for the forecasting\nprocess. In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other\ngains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. the bottom line. Each segment of the income\nstatement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to",

Using multiple scenarios and the probability of each scenario occurring is a common approach\nto estimating future sales.\nFigure 18.7 Historical Sales Data\nWe can see at first glance that sales remain fairly steady from January to April. Sales then goes up significantly\nin April and May, seem to peak in June, taper off a bit in July, then decline steeply from August to the end of the\nyear, with the lowest sales being in November and December. Though not exact, it’s easy to quickly see that\nsales follow a seasonal pattern. We will focus on just one year of data here to keep things simple. However, it’s\nimportant to note that when a firm has a seasonal sales pattern, it normally uses more than one year of data\nto detect and evaluate the pattern. It’s not uncommon for firms to have a seasonal sales pattern that\nfluctuates based on an external factor such as weather patterns, patterns in business or demand, or other\n18.2 • Forecasting Sales\n541\nfactors such as holidays. Common examples might include farm-based businesses that function on a weather\npattern for harvesting and selling crops or a toy company that fluctuates around gift-giving holidays.\nThis knowledge is helpful when assembling a first pass at the next year’s sales forecast. Using common-size\nand horizontal (trend) analyses on sales is also helpful, as shown in Figure 18.8. We can see the exact\npercentages that sales went up or down each month:\n•\nIn January, the company had sales of $9,000, which was\nof the total annual sales.\n•\nIn June, the company had $19,000 sales, which was\nof the total annual sales and\nof January sales.\nFigure 18.8 Historical Sales Data as Percentages\nOnce a baseline in the 12-month period is assessed, it can also be helpful to look for trends in other ways. For\nexample, the past several years might be assessed to see if there is a trend in total growth or decline for those\nyears on a summary basis or by period. Clear Lake Sporting Goods had sales in the current year of $126,000, in\nthe prior year of $105,000, and two years ago of $89,000. This reflects a 20% increase and an 18% increase,\nrespectively.

Using the company’s net sales figures for the current and prior years, what percentage might you\nrecommend for their sales forecast for the next year?\nSolution:\nBig 5’s sales for 2020 and 2019 were $1,041,212,000 and $996,495,000, respectively. This represents a 4.5%\ngrowth from the prior year. Forecasted sales, based solely on this information, might be appropriate at\n4.5% growth for the next year, keeping in mind that many other factors should also be considered along\nwith this information. Historical sales are only one set of data to use as a starting point.\nLooking at Figure 18.9, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods decides to take its first pass at a forecast using\nthe more conservative estimate of 18% total sales growth. The company could consider last year’s sales of\n$126,000 and increase them by 18% to arrive at total forecasted sales for next year of\n. Next, to get the monthly sales, the company could use the same percent of the\ntotal for each month that it did for the previous year. For example, sales in January of last year were 7.1% of\nthe full year’s sales. To find the forecast for the next year, the company would take the forecasted sales of\n$148,680 for the year and multiply that by 7.1% to get $10,620 for January.

As we saw earlier in the chapter, we begin with forecasted sales because they are\nthe basis for many of the forecasted costs.\nLet’s begin with the sales forecast for Clear Lake Sporting Goods that we saw earlier in the chapter, in Figure\n18.9, and use it along with the prior year income statement by month shown in Figure 18.12. We will consider\nother data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.12 Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month\nThe first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income.

Figure 18.13 shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods using all of this data.\nFigure 18.13 Forecasted Income Statement\nForecast the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales.

The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable.

While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process.

Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential\nchanges they are considering.

Early political economists like Adam Smith and Karl Marx identified\nthis concept of capital, along with labor and entrepreneurship, to be the factors of production.\nThat general idea of capital is important and critical to a company’s productive capacity. This chapter is about\na specific type of capital— working capital—that is just as important as long-term capital. Working capital\ndescribes the resources that are needed to meet the daily, weekly, and monthly operating cash flow needs.\nEmployees are paid out of working capital as well as cash from operations, the fulfillment of merchandise\norders is possible because of working capital, and the liquidity of a company hinges upon how well\nmanagement plans and controls working capital.\nUnderstanding working capital begins with the concept of current assets—those resources of a business that\nare cash, near cash, or expected to be turned into cash within a year through the normal operations of the\nbusiness. Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with\nterm gross working capital.",

It allows businesses to purchase goods and services on credit, and to pay for them over time. This can be helpful in times of financial stress, as it can provide a company with the time and resources it needs to get back on its feet. Working capital is also important for businesses to plan for. It is the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities, and it is used to finance day-to-day operations. A company with a large amount of working capital is better able to weather financial storms and take advantage of opportunities as they arise. In short, trade credit and working capital are both important for businesses to have in order to survive and thrive."

Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with\nterm gross working capital.\nCash is needed to pay the bills and meet the payroll. Excess cash is invested in cash alternatives such as\nmarketable securities, creating liquidity that can be tapped when operating cash flow needs exceed the\namount of cash on hand (checking account balances). Investment in inventory is necessary to meet the\ndemand for products (sales), and if the firm extends credit to its customers so that a sale can be made, the\nbalance sheet will also show accounts receivable—a very common current asset that derives its value from the\nprobability that customers will pay their bills.\nWorking capital is often spoken about in two versions: gross working capital and net working capital. As was\npreviously stated, gross working capital is equivalent to current assets, particularly those that are cash, cash-\nlike, or will be converted to cash within a short period of time (i.e., in less than one year).\nNet working capital (NWC) is a more refined concept of working capital.

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.",

Financial managers monitor and analyze each component\nof the cash conversion cycle. Ideally, a company’s management should minimize the number of days it takes\nto convert inventory to cash while maximizing the amount of time it takes to pay suppliers.\nQuickly converting inventory to sales speeds up cash inflows and shortens the cash cycle, but it also could help\nreduce inventory losses as a result of obsolescence. Inventory becomes obsolete because of a variety of\nfactors including time—inventory that has not been sold for a long period of time and is not expected to be\nsold in the future has to be written down or written off according to accounting rules. Write-offs of inventory\ncan result in significant losses for a company. In the food business, inventory conversion periods take on great\nimportance because of spoilage of perishable goods; in retailing, seasonal items lose value the longer they\nstay on the shelves.\nVarious inventory management techniques are used to shorten production time in manufacturing, and in\nretailing, strategies are used to reduce the amount of time a product sits on the shelf or is stored in the\nwarehouse. Production techniques such as just-in-time inventory systems and marketing and pricing\nstrategies can have an impact on the number of days in the inventory conversion cycle.\nFor the receivables collection period, a relatively long receivables collection period means that the company is\nhaving trouble collecting cash from its customers and so whatever can be done to speed up collections while\nstill offering competitive credit terms should be pursued by financial managers. For example, companies that\nconverted paper invoicing to e-invoicing most likely reduce the average collection period by some number of\ndays, as it makes sense that if a bill is transmitted electronically, lag time is cut (no delays because of “snail\nmail”) and collections (payments back to the company from customers) may happen sooner. Other credit\nmanagement techniques, some of which are explained in subsequent sections, can help minimize and control\nthe receivables collection period.\nThe payables deferral period is the one element that probably cannot be optimized without violating credit",

With a credit card, a consumer opens an account with a credit limit. Most trade credit is\noffered to a company with an open account that has a credit limit up to which the company can purchase\ngoods or services without having to pay the cash up front. As long as the payments are made in accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement (also called credit terms), no interest or additional fees are charged on the\ncredit balance except possibly for a fee for late payment.\nInitially, the vendor’s credit department approves both a trade credit limit and credit payment terms (i.e.,\nnumber of days after the invoice date that payment is due). Timely payments on accounts payable (trade\ncredit) helps create a credit history for the purchasing firm.\nTrade Credit Terms\nTrade credit arrangements often carry credit terms that offer an incentive, called a discount, for a company\n(the buyer) to pay its bill within a relatively short period of time. Net terms, also referred to as the full credit\nperiod, are the number of days that a business (purchaser) has before they must pay their invoice. A common\nnet term is Net 30, with payment due in full within 30 days of the invoice.\nMany vendors also offer cash discounts to customers that pay their bill early. A company’s invoice that\nspecifies payment terms of “2/10 n/30” (stated as: “two ten net 30”) would allow a 2 percent discount if the\nbuyer’s account balance is paid within 10 days of the invoice date; otherwise, the net amount owed would be\ndue in 30 days. The “10 days” in the example is the discount period—the number of days the buyer has to\ntake advantage of the cash discount for an early payment, also known as quick payment.\nFor example, Jackson’s Premium Jams Inc. received a $10,500 invoice for the purchase of jelly jars. The invoice\nhas payment terms of 2/10 n/30. Jackson’s pays the bill within 10 days of the invoice date. Jackson’s payment\nwould be\n. The effect of taking a discount because of a quick payment\nis a lowering of the cost of inventory in the case of purchases of materials (for a manufacturer), merchandise",

Using accounts payable to purchase goods and services can involve an\nopportunity cost—a cost of the forgone opportunity of making a quick payment and benefiting from a cash\ndiscount. A business that does not take advantage of a cash discount for early payment of trade credit will pay\nmore for goods and services than a business that routinely takes advantage of discounts.\nThe annual percentage rate of forgoing quick payment discounts can be estimated with the following formula:\nExample: Novelty Accessories Inc. (NAI) purchases products from a vendor that offers credit payment terms of\n2/10, net 30. The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73\npercent.\n19.3\nCash Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why firms hold cash.\n•\nList instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.\nCash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows.

To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected",

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments. Cash alternative investments are not committed to the\nstock market.\nSecurity\nDescription\nUS Treasury bills",

Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000.

Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender).

Earlier in the\nchapter, the concept of the inventory conversion cycle was covered. The number of days that goods are held\nby a business is one of the focal points of inventory management.\nManagers look to minimize inventory balances and raise inventory turnover ratios while trying to balance the\nneeds of operations and sales. Purchasing personnel need to order enough inventory to “feed” production or\nto stock the shelves. The sales force wants to meet or surpass their sales budgets, and the operations people\nneed inventory for the factories, warehouses, and e-commerce sites.\nThe days in inventory ratio measures the average number of days between acquiring inventory (i.e.,\npurchasing merchandise) and its sale. This ratio is a metric to be watched and monitored by inventory\nmanagers and, if possible, minimized. A high days in inventory ratio could mean “aging” inventory. Old\ninventory could mean obsolesce or, in the case of perishable goods, spoilage. In either case, old inventory\nmeans losses.\nImagine a company selling high-tech products such as consumer electronics. A high days in inventory ratio",

Concepts such as just-in-time (JIT) inventory practices and economic order\nquantity (EOQ) are tools used by inventory managers, both of which help keep a company lean (minimizing\ninventory) while making sure the inventory resources are in place in time to complete the sale.\nBenefit of Holding Inventory\nBrick-and-mortar stores need goods in stock so that the customer can see and touch the product and be able\nto acquire it when they need it. Customers are disappointed if they cannot see and touch the item or if they\nfind out upon arrival at the store that it is out of stock.\nCustomers of all kinds don’t want to wait for the delivery of a purchase.

Product fulfillment and availability is important.\nInventory must be in stock, or sales will be lost.\nIn manufacturing, the inventory of materials and component parts must be in place at the start of the value\nchain (the conversion process), and finished goods need to be ready to meet scheduled shipments.

The budgeting process of a company is a really an integrated process—it links a\nseries of budgets together so that company objectives can be achieved.

Changes in any of the “upstream” budgets—budgets that are prepared before the cash\nbudget, such as the sales, purchases, and production budgets—may need to be revised because of changing\nassumptions. New economic forecasts and even cost-cutting measures will require a revision of the cash\nbudget.\nAlthough a budget might be prepared for each month of a future 12-month period, such as the upcoming\nfiscal year, a rolling budget is often used. A rolling budget changes often as the planning period (e.g., a fiscal\nyear) plays out. When one month ends, another month is added to the end (the next column) of the budget.\nFor example, if in your budget January is the first month of the planning period, once January is over, next\nJanuary’s cash budget column would be added—right after December’s column (at the far right of the\nbudget).\nSample One-Year (Annual) Operating Budget\nPreparing an annual operating budget can be a complex task. In essence, a company budget is a series of\nbudgets, many of which are interrelated.\nThe sales budget is prepared first and has an impact on many other budgets.

If sales are expected to increase, purchases of\ninventory and some operating expenses would also increase. To meet the demand for goods and services (as\ndefined in the sales budget), a purchases (inventory) budget would be prepared. In this example (Figure 19.8),\nthe purchases budget shows projected purchases of inventory (merchandise) and the projected payments\n(also called disbursements) for each month.\nCash outflows as a result of purchases often do not equal the projected purchase amount. That is because\npayments for purchases are usually on credit (accounts payable), and so purchases for one month typically get\nspread out over a period of time that encompasses the current month and the month (or months) thereafter.\nTo keep this example simple, the assumption is that the purchases are paid for in the following month (an\naverage days payable outstanding of 30 days). However, in other cases, payment patterns may be based on\nother payment periods such as 45, 60, or even 90 days, depending on the trade credit terms.\nFigure 19.8 Purchases Budget\nAn operating expense budget is prepared next and is basically a prediction of the selling and administrative\nexpenditures of the company.

The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables.

In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital.

Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the\nexpenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.\nThe Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in\nFigure 20.3. In 2012, $1.00 could be purchased with fewer than 80 Japanese yen. In 2015, it took over 120 yen to\npurchase $1.00.\nFigure 20.3 Japanese Yen to One US Dollar8\nIf a company is receiving yen from customers and paying expenses in dollars, the company is harmed when\nthe yen depreciates relative to the dollar, meaning that the yen the company receives from its customers can\nbe exchanged for fewer dollars. Conversely, when the yen appreciates, it takes fewer yen to purchase each\ndollar; this appreciation of the yen benefits companies with revenues in yen and expenses in dollars.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nProjecting Sales in US Dollars\nThe managers of a firm think that the exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollars will be\nnext year.

Starbucks might purchase a coffee plantation in Costa Rica for 120\nmillion Costa Rican colones. This land is an asset for Starbucks, and as such, the value of it should appear on\nthe company’s balance sheet.\nThe balance sheet for Starbucks is created using US dollar values. Thus, the value of the coffee plantation has\nto be translated to dollars. Because exchange rates are volatile, the dollar value of the asset will vary\ndepending on the day on which the translation takes place. If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,\nthen this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance. The loss is\ndue simply to changes in exchange rates and not the underlying profitability of the company.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers or its\nsales.

This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate\nthe company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six\nmonths.\nThe price that is in the contract is called the strike price (exercise price). Suppose the company purchases a\ncall contract for US dollars with a strike price of KWN 1,200/USD. While this contract would be for a set size, or\na certain number of US dollars, we will talk about this transaction as if it were per one US dollar to highlight\nhow options contracts work.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n609\nThe company must pay a price, known as the premium, to purchase this call option contract. For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is\n, then the company will choose to exercise\nthe option.

Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes\nup and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press.

The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has\nor its sales\nEuropean option\nan option that the holder can exercise only on the expiration date\nexchange rate\nthe price of one currency in terms of another currency\nexercise price (strike price)\nthe price the option holder pays for the underlying asset when exercising an\noption",

It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share. The ratio is used to determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. A high P/B ratio indicates that the stock is overvalued, while a low P/B ratio indicates that the stock is undervalued. The P/B ratio is also known as the market-to-book ratio."
