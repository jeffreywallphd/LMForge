This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve. \n3. Explain how politics and law are related. \n4. Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws.",

In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority.

Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between.

To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to \nunderstand the relationships between the various kinds of law. \n \n \nConstitutions \nConstitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1]",

Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise.",

In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders.

The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment.

For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final.

Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior to any trial. \n2. Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial. \n \n \nThe early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex \nprocess of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A lawsuit will start \nwith the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the \ndefendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim). After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge. Motions in the \nearly stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to \ncompel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process. \n \nInitial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss \nThe first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings. These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail.

The defendant is saying, in effect, \nthat even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by \nthe court. For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-\ncalled alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will \ndismiss the complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a \ndemurrer.) \n \nA third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment. If there is no triable \nquestion of fact or law, there is no reason to have a trial. For example, the plaintiff sues on a promissory \nnote and, at deposition (an oral examination under oath), the defendant admits having made no payment \non the note and offers no excuse that would be recognizable as a reason not to pay.

The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence.

Explain the historical importance and basic structure of the US Constitution. \n2. Know what judicial review is and what it represents in terms of the separation of powers between the \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. \n3. Locate the source of congressional power to regulate the economy under the Constitution, and explain \nwhat limitations there are to the reach of congressional power over interstate commerce. \n4. Describe the different phases of congressional power over commerce, as adjudged by the US Supreme \nCourt over time. \n5. Explain what power the states retain over commerce, and how the Supreme Court may sometimes limit \nthat power. \n6. Describe how the Supreme Court, under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, balances state and \nfederal laws that may be wholly or partly in conflict. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n140 \n7. Explain how the Bill of Rights relates to business activities in the United States. \n \n \nThe US Constitution is the foundation for all of US law. Business and commerce are directly affected \nby the words, meanings, and interpretations of the Constitution. Because it speaks in general terms, \nits provisions raise all kinds of issues for scholars, lawyers, judges, politicians, and commentators. \nFor example, arguments still rage over the nature and meaning of “federalism,” the concept that \nthere is shared governance between the states and the federal government. The US Supreme Court is \nthe ultimate arbiter of those disputes, and as such it has a unique role in the legal system. It has \nassumed the power of judicial review, unique among federal systems globally, through which it can \nstrike down federal or state statutes that it believes violate the Constitution and can even void the \npresident’s executive orders if they are contrary to the Constitution’s language. No knowledgeable \ncitizen or businessperson can afford to be ignorant of its basic provisions. \n \n \n4.1 Basic Aspects of the US Constitution \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware). The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so",

The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so \nthe federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate seats for every state, no matter how small. \nThe Senate was also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial nominations. The net effect \nof this today is that senators from a very small number of states can block treaties and other important \nlegislation. The power of small states is also magnified by the Senate’s cloture rule, which currently \nrequires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. \n \nBecause the Constitution often speaks in general terms (with broad phrases such as “due process” and \n“equal protection”), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those terms apply in specific cases.

Thus any statute (or \nportion thereof) or legal ruling (judicial or administrative) in conflict with the Constitution is not \nenforceable. And as the Bush v.

To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1.

By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates.

When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules.

Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data.

Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route.

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree).

Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken.

Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal.",

This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead? The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison).

For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.

Most criminal law requires a specific \nintent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern \nlegislation, dispense with the requirement of intent). In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies. Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors. Most people have a \ngeneral notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft. But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act. It is usually easier to convict someone of attempt or conspiracy than to convict for the main \ncrime, and a person involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony may find that very little is required to put \nhim into serious trouble.",

Hurting \nsomeone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet \nthe law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a \nremedy for \"defaming\" someone, orally or in writing, to others. \n \nAlthough the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines.

All are examples of tort suits. \n \nThe law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by \nlegislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the \ncommon law (judicial decisions). Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules \nthat govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other.

But torts and crimes are different, and the \ndifference is worth noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society punishes the murderer; \nit does not usually compensate the family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a \nprivate wrong for which damages are owed.

Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states",

Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings.

However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case.

In fact there is no single right of privacy. Courts and \ncommentators have discerned at least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control the \nappropriation of your name and picture for commercial purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on \nyour “personal space” or seclusion, (3) freedom from public disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts \nof your personal life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a “false light.” \n \nAppropriation of Name or Likeness \nThe earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was appropriation of name or likeness: someone else \nplacing your photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using your name as endorsing a \nproduct or in the product name. A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or \npicture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first \nobtaining written consent.

For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold. \nThis limitation was known as the rule of privity. And users who were not immediate purchasers were said \nnot to be in privity with a supplier or manufacturer. In 1916, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, then on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n300 \nNew York Court of Appeals, penned an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of privity, \nthough it would take half a century before the last state—Mississippi in 1966—would fall in line. \nDetermining a duty of care can be a vexing problem. Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of \nmedical ethics to respect the confidences of their patients. Suppose a patient tells a psychiatrist that he \nintends to kill his girlfriend. Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn prospective victim? \nThe California Supreme Court has said yes. [1] \n \nEstablishing a breach of the duty of due care where the defendant has violated a statute or municipal \nordinance is eased considerably with the doctrine of negligence per se, a doctrine common to all US \nstate courts. If a legislative body sets a minimum standard of care for particular kinds of acts to protect a \ncertain set of people from harm and a violation of that standard causes harm to someone in that set, the \ndefendant is negligent per se. If Harvey is driving sixty-five miles per hour in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour \nzone when he crashes into Haley’s car and the police accident report establishes that or he otherwise \nadmits to going ten miles per hour over the speed limit, Haley does not have to prove that Harvey has \nbreached a duty of due care. She will only have to prove that the speeding was an actual and proximate \ncause of the collision and will also have to prove the extent of the resulting damages to her. \n \nCausation: Actual Cause and Proximate Cause \n“For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost,” as the old saying has it. Virtually any cause of an injury can be \ntraced to some preceding cause.

Thus the status of the Slave has \ndisappeared—it has been superseded by the contractual relation of the servant to his master. . . . \nThe status of the Female under Tutelage . . . has also ceased to exist. . . . So too the status of the \nSon under Power has no true place in the law of modern European societies. If any civil \nobligation binds together the Parent and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives \nits legal validity.... If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to \nsignify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we \nmay say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from \nStatus to Contract. [1] \n \nThis movement was not accidental. It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the \nfifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy \nwith all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, \ncommercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n330 \nContract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan.

For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions.

This first \nproved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to business as the American economy became \nnationwide during the twentieth century. Although there had been some uniform laws concerned with \ncommercial deals—including the Uniform Sales Act, first published in 1906—few were widely adopted and \nnone nationally. As a result, the law governing sales of goods, negotiable instruments, warehouse receipts, \nsecurities, and other matters crucial to doing business in an industrial, market economy was a crazy quilt \nof untidy provisions that did not mesh well from state to state. \n \nInitial drafting of the UCC began in 1942 and was ten years in the making, involving the efforts of \nhundreds of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and judges. A final draft, promulgated by the Institute and \nthe Conference, was endorsed by the American Bar Association and published in 1951. \n \nPennsylvania enacted the code in its entirety in 1953. It was the only state to enact the original version, \nbecause the Law Revision Commission of the New York State legislature began to examine it line by line \nand had serious objections. Three years later, in 1956, a revised code was issued. This version, known as \nthe 1957 Official Text, was enacted in Massachusetts and Kentucky. In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform.

This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity. A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on.

The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of \ngoods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only \nincidentally used, with Newmark v. Gimbel’s Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), in which the court said “[i]f \nthe permanent wave lotion were sold … for home consumption . . . unquestionably an implied warranty of \nfitness for that purpose would have been an integral incident of the sale.” The New Jersey court rejected \nthe defendant’s argument that by actually applying the lotion to the patron’s head the salon lessened the \nliability it otherwise would have had if it had simply sold her the lotion. \n \nIn two areas, state legislatures have taken the goods vs. services issue out of the courts’ hands and \nresolved the issue through legislation.

That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard. The Restatement (Second) of \nContracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n342 \nanother.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their \nlanguage or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or \ncourse of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what \nthey thought they said or did. \n \nThe distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims \nhe spoke in jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment.

The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease.

A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor.

But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v.

This literalist approach is justified by the more general \nprinciple that we each should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular course. \n \nBut the agency relationship is more than a contractual one, and the agent’s responsibilities go beyond the \nborder of the contract. Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause \nin the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several \naspects. \n \nDuty to Avoid Self-Dealing \nA fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his \nprincipal’s interest in that same transaction.

The law therefore prohibits an agent from using for his own \npurposes or in ways that would injure the interests of the principal, information confidentially given or \nacquired. This prohibition extends to information gleaned from the principal though unrelated to the \nagent’s assignment: “[A]n agent who is told by the principal of his plans, or who secretly examines books \nor memoranda of the employer, is not privileged to use such information at his principal’s \nexpense.” [1] Nor may the agent use confidential information after resigning his agency.

The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is.

Courts are apt to be liberal in construing statutes to include \nthose who might not seem to be employed. InBetts v. Ann Arbor Public Schools, a University of \nMichigan student majoring in physical education was a student teacher in a junior high \nschool. [7] During a four-month period, he taught two physical education courses. On the last day \nof his student teaching, he walked into the locker room and thirty of his students grabbed him \nand tossed him into the swimming pool. This was traditional, but he “didn’t feel like going in that \nmorning” and put up a struggle that ended with a whistle on an elastic band hitting him in the \neye, which he subsequently lost as a result of the injury. He filed a workers’ compensation claim. \nThe school board argued that he could not be classified as an employee because he received no \npay. Since he was injured by students—not considered agents of the school—he would probably \nhave been unsuccessful in filing a tort suit; hence the workers’ compensation claim was his only \nchance of recompense. The state workers’ compensation appeal board ruled against the school on \nthe ground that payment in money was not required: “Plaintiff was paid in the form of training, \ncollege credits towards graduation, and meeting of the prerequisites of a state provisional \ncertificate.” The state supreme court affirmed the award. \n• \nHow palpable must the “injury” be? A difficult issue is whether a worker is entitled to \ncompensation for psychological injury, including cumulative trauma. Until the 1970s, insurance \ncompanies and compensation boards required physical injury before making an award. Claims \nthat job stresses led to nervous breakdowns or other mental disorders were rejected. But most \ncourts have liberalized the definition of injury and now recognize that psychological trauma can \nbe real and that job stress can bring it on, as shown by the discussion of Wolfe v.

The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent? \n4.

This practice has understandably led to a number of problems, legal and otherwise. One of \nthe legal issues that sometimes arises is exemplified by this lawsuit. The named plaintiffs, who were \nclassified by Microsoft as independent contractors, seek to strip that label of its protective covering and \nto obtain for themselves certain benefits that the company provided to all of its regular or permanent \nemployees. After certifying the named plaintiffs as representatives of a class of “common-law \nemployees,” the district court granted summary judgment to Microsoft on all counts. The \nplaintiffs…now appeal as to two of their claims: a) the claim…that they are entitled to savings benefits \nunder Microsoft’s Savings Plus Plan (SPP); and b) that…they are entitled to stock-option benefits under \nMicrosoft’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays.

On one occasion he left work at her suggestion because he appeared to be so \nnervous. This condition persisted until the morning of June 9, 1971 when according to the claimant, Mr. \nGorman looked much better and even smiled and ‘tousled her hair’ when she so remarked. \n \nA short time later Mr. Gorman called her on the intercom and asked her to call the police to room 615. \nMrs. Wolfe complied with this request and then tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Gorman on the \nintercom.

As to the first \nclass our court has consistently recognized the principle that an injury caused by emotional stress or \nshock may be accidental within the purview of the compensation law.

This determination is based on two considerations. First, as noted in the \npsychiatric testimony there is nothing in the nature of a stress or shock situation which ordains physical \nas opposed to psychological injury. The determinative factor is the particular vulnerability of an individual \nby virtue of his physical makeup. In a given situation one person may be susceptible to a heart attack \nwhile another may suffer a depressive reaction. In either case the result is the same—the individual is \nincapable of functioning properly because of an accident and should be compensated under the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Law. \n \nSecondly, having recognized the reliability of identifying psychic trauma as a causative factor of injury in \nsome cases and the reliability by identifying psychological injury as a resultant factor in other cases, we \nsee no reason for limiting recovery in the latter instance to cases involving physical impact. There is \nnothing talismanic about physical impact. \n \nWe would note in passing that this analysis reflects the view of the majority of jurisdictions in this country \nand England.

It \nalso makes sense that—as is the general rule—an agent is not liable on contracts she makes on the \nprincipal’s behalf; the agent is not a party to a contract made by the agent on behalf of the principal. No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.)

So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal.

The suit for damages arose out of an assault, including rape, committed with a knife and \nother weapons upon the plaintiff on May 9, 1972, by Michael Carey, a nineteen-year-old deliveryman for \nPep Line Trucking Company, Inc. Three months after the trial, Judge Parker set aside the verdict and \nrendered judgment for both defendants notwithstanding the verdict.

This was the import of the trial judge’s \ninstructions. The verdict as to Pep Line should not have been disturbed. \nIrene Lyon bought a mattress and springs for her bed from the defendant George’s Radio and Television \nCompany, Inc. The merchandise was to be delivered on May 9, 1972. Irene Lyon had to be at work and the \nplaintiff [Irene’s sister] Corene Lyon, had agreed to wait in her sister’s apartment to receive the delivery. \n \nA C.O.D. balance of $13.24 was due on the merchandise, and Irene Lyon had left a check for $13.24 to \ncover that balance. Plaintiff had been requested by her sister to “wait until the mattress and the springs \ncame and to check and make sure they were okay.” \n \nPlaintiff, fully clothed, answered the door. Her description of what happened is sufficiently brief and \nunqualified that it will bear repeating in full. She testified, without objection, as follows: \n \nI went to the door, and I looked in the peephole, and I asked who was there. The young man told \nme he was a delivery man from George’s. He showed me a receipt, and it said, ‘George’s.’ He said \nhe [needed cash on delivery—COD], so I let him in, and I told him to bring the mattress upstairs \nand he said, ‘No,’ that he wasn’t going to lug them upstairs, and he wanted the COD first, and I \ntold him I wanted to see the mattress and box springs to make sure they were okay, and he said \nno, he wasn’t going to lug them upstairs [until he got the check]. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n442 \n \nSo this went back and forwards and so he was getting angry, and I told him to wait right here \nwhile I go get the COD.

Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order.

The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460 \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit”) and retained the \ncommon-law theory that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals—the aggregate theory. \n \nRUPA moved more toward making partnerships entities. According to the NCCUL, “The Revised Act \nenhances the entity treatment of partnerships to achieve simplicity for state law purposes, particularly in \nmatters concerning title to partnership property. RUPA does not, however, relentlessly apply the entity \napproach. The aggregate approach is retained for some purposes, such as partners’ joint and several \nliability.” [4] Section 201(a) provides, “A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.” [5] \nEntity Characteristics of a Partnership \nUnder RUPA, then, a partnership has entity characteristics, but the partners remain guarantors of \npartnership obligations, as always—that is the partners’ joint and several liability noted in the previous \nparagraph (and discussed further in Chapter 12 \"Partnership Operation and Termination\"). This is a very \nimportant point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them \nis, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes \npersonal and unlimited liability. This personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished, \nsubject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and limited liability companies, as discussed \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". And, of course, the owners of corporations are also not generally \nliable for the corporation’s obligations, which is a major reason for the corporate form’s popularity. \n \nFor Accounting Purposes \nUnder both versions of the law, the partnership may keep business records as if it were a separate entity, \nand its accountants may treat it as such for purposes of preparing income statements and balance sheets. \n \nFor Purposes of Taxation \nUnder both versions of the law, partnerships are not taxable entities, so they do not pay income taxes. \nInstead, each partner’s distributive share, which includes income or other gain, loss, deductions, and",

Under \nneither law can a partner unilaterally dispose of partnership property, however labeled, for the obvious \nreason that one cannot dispose of another’s property or property rights without permission.

Partnerships do not pay taxes; the individual partners do.

Joint venturers are fiduciaries toward one another. \nAlthough no formality is necessary, the associates will usually sign an agreement. The joint venture need have no \ngroup name, though it may have one. Property may be owned jointly. Profits and losses will be shared, as in a \npartnership, and each associate has the right to participate in management. Liability is unlimited. Sometimes two \nor more businesses will form a joint venture to carry out a specific task—prospecting for oil, building a nuclear \nreactor, doing basic scientific research—and will incorporate the joint venture.

For example, \nin 1984 General Motors entered into a joint venture with Toyota to revive GM’s shuttered Fremont, California, \nassembly plant to create New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). For GM the joint venture was an \nopportunity to learn about lean manufacturing from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first \nmanufacturing base in North America and a chance to test its production system in an American labor \nenvironment.

Employment Security Commission \n274 A.2d 707 (Del. 1971) \n \nSTOREY, J. \n \nThe Employment Security Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, levied an involuntary \nassessment against Richard K. Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important.

The fourth paragraph declared that all partnership policy \nwould be decided by Chaiken, whose decision was final. The fifth paragraph forbade assignment of the \nagreement without permission of Chaiken. The sixth paragraph required Chaiken to hold and distribute \nall receipts. The final paragraph stated hours of work for Strazella and Spitzer and holidays. \n \nThe mere existence of an agreement labeled “partnership” agreement and the characterization of \nsignatories as “partners” docs not conclusively prove the existence of a partnership. Rather, the intention \nof the parties, as explained by the wording of the agreement, is paramount. \n \nA partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for \nprofit. As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept. Co-owners should also contribute valuable consideration \nfor the creation of the business. Under paragraph two, however, Chaiken provides the barber chair (and \nimplicitly the barber shop itself), mirror, licenses and linen, while the other partners merely provide their \ntools and labor—nothing more than any barber-employee would furnish. Standing alone, however, mere \ncontribution of work and skill can be valuable consideration for a partnership agreement. \n \nPartnership interests may be assignable, although it is not a violation of partnership law to prohibit \nassignment in a partnership agreement.

But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent, \ncoupled with the absence of profit sharing, they become strong factors in discrediting the partnership \nargument. Such weighing of the elements against a partnership finding compares favorably with Fenwick \nv. Unemployment Compensation Commission, which decided against the partnership theory on similar \nfacts, including the filing of partnership income tax forms. \n \nIn addition, the total circumstances of the case taken together indicate the employer-employee \nrelationship between Chaiken and his barbers.

The barbers brought into the relationship only the \nequipment required of all barber shop operators. And each barber had his own individual “partnership”",

Moreover, Whitehead does not allege \nthat he was misled by either Loomis or Shanahan in any way that would cause him to think he was doing \nbusiness with the 52 Cattle Company. In fact, Whitehead did not know of the 52 Cattle Company until \nShanahan mentioned it in his deposition.

Epsco, Inc. \n98 S.W.3d 421 (Ark. 2003) \n \nHannah, J. \nAppellants Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers appeal a judgment entered against them by the Craighead \nCounty Circuit Court. Reggie and Mark argue that the trial court erred in holding them liable for a \ncompany debt based upon partnership by estoppel because the proof was vague and insufficient and there \nwas no detrimental reliance on the part of a creditor. We hold that the trial court was not clearly \nerroneous in finding liability based upon partnership by estoppel. Accordingly, we affirm. \n \nFacts \nGary Chavers operated Chavers Welding and Construction (“CWC”), a construction and welding business, \nin Jonesboro. Gary’s sons Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers joined their father in the business after \ngraduating from high school. Gary, Mark, and Reggie maintain that CWC was a sole proprietorship owned \nby Gary, and that Reggie and Mark served only as CWC employees, not as CWC partners. \n \nIn February 1999, CWC entered into an agreement with Epsco, Inc. (“Epsco”), a staffing service, to \nprovide payroll and employee services for CWC. Initially, Epsco collected payments for its services on a \nweekly basis, but later, Epsco extended credit to CWC. Melton Clegg, President of Epsco, stated that his \ndecision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was a partnership. \n \nCWC’s account with Epsco became delinquent, and Epsco filed a complaint against Gary, Reggie, and \nMark, individually, and doing business as CWC, to recover payment for the past due account.

Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners.

In his classic textbook Economics, Professor Paul Samuelson observed that unlimited \nliability “reveals why partnerships tend to be confined to small, personal enterprises.…When it becomes a \nquestion of placing their personal fortunes in jeopardy, people are reluctant to put their capital into \ncomplex ventures over which they can exercise little control.…In the field of investment banking, concerns \nlike JPMorgan Chase used to advertise proudly ‘not incorporated’ so that their creditors could have extra \nassurance. But even these concerns have converted themselves into corporate entities.” [8] \n \nPartners’ Personal Liability for Torts \nOf course, a person is always liable for his own torts. All partners are also liable for any partner’s tort \ncommitted in the scope of partnership business under agency law, and this liability is—again—personal \nand unlimited, subject to RUPA’s requirement that the judgment creditor exhaust the partnership’s assets \nbefore going after the separate assets of the partners. The partner who commits a tort or breach of trust \nmust indemnify the partnership for losses paid to the third party. [9] \nLiability for Crimes \nCriminal liability is generally personal to the miscreant. Nonparticipating copartners are ordinarily not \nliable for crimes if guilty intent is an element. When guilty intent is not an element, as in certain \nregulatory offenses, all partners may be guilty of an act committed by a partner in the course of the \nbusiness. \n \nLiability for Taxes \nCorporate income gets taxed twice under federal law: once to the corporation and again to the \nshareholders who receive income as dividends. However, the partnership’s income “passes through” the \npartnership and is distributed to the partners under the conduit theory. When partners get income \nfrom the firm they have to pay tax on it, but the partnership pays no tax (it files an information return). \nThis is perceived to be a significant advantage of the partnership form. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n510 \n \nThe partnership is generally liable for any contract made by a partner with authority express, implied, or \napparent. Under RUPA the firm, partners, or even nonpartners may to some extent limit their liability by filing",

In his classic textbook Economics, Professor Paul Samuelson observed that unlimited liability “reveals why partnerships tend to be confined to small, personal enterprises.…When it becomes a question of placing their personal fortunes in jeopardy, people are reluctant to put their capital into complex ventures over which they can exercise little control.…In the field of investment banking, concerns like JPMorgan Chase used to advertise proudly ‘not incorporated’ so that their creditors could have extra assurance. But even these concerns have converted themselves into corporate entities.”"

Assume that when Baker left, the business owed Mogul Parts Company \n$5,000 and Laid Back Upholsterers $4,000. After Baker left and Alice joined, Mogul sells another $5,000 \nworth of parts to the firm on credit, and Sizzling Radiator Repair, a new creditor, advances $3,000 worth \nof radiator repair parts.

The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589",

In Citizens United, the Court struck down the part of the McCain-Feingold Act [2] that \nprohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting \n“electioneering communications.” \nAbsence of Rights \nCorporations lack certain rights that natural persons possess. For example, corporations do not have the \nprivilege against self-incrimination guaranteed for natural persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation.

Under the federal income tax laws \nthen in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During \nthe 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax \nbenefits.

In many states that have not adopted the \nmodel act, the contract rule applies and the offer is always revocable. Other states use various common-\nlaw devices to prevent revocation.

(And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million.

Between May 17 and November 8, the Bureau \npurchased eight typewriters from I.B.M., on account of which partial payments were made, leaving a \nbalance due of $4,333.40, for which this suit was brought. \n \nAlthough a question is raised as to the propriety of making use of a motion for summary judgment as the \nmeans of determining the issues presented by the pleadings, we think the motion was appropriate.

The trial court found that it was, but we disagree. \n \nThe fundamental question presented by the appeal is whether an officer of a defectively incorporated \nassociation may be subjected to personal liability under the circumstances of this case. We think not. \n \nTraditionally, two doctrines have been used by the courts to clothe an officer of a defectively incorporated \nassociation with the corporate attribute of limited liability. The first, often referred to as the doctrine of de \nfacto corporations, has been applied in those cases where there are elements showing: (1) the existence of \nlaw authorizing incorporation; (2) an effort in good faith to incorporate under the existing law; and (3) \nactual use or exercise of corporate powers. The second, the doctrine of estoppel to deny the corporate \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n623 \nexistence, is generally employed where the person seeking to hold the officer personally liable has \ncontracted or otherwise dealt with the association in such a manner as to recognize and in effect admit its \nexistence as a corporate body. \n \n* * * \n \nThere is, as we see it, a wide difference between creating a corporation by means of the de facto doctrine \nand estopping a party, due to his conduct in a particular case, from setting up the claim of no \nincorporation.

Accordingly, even though one or more of the \nrequisites of a de facto corporation are absent, we think that this factor does not preclude the application \nof the estoppel doctrine in a proper case, such as the one at bar. \n \nI.B.M. contends that the failure of the Bureau to file its certificate of incorporation debarred all corporate \nexistence.

In 1 Clark and Marshall, \nPrivate Corporations, § 89, it is stated: \n \nThe doctrine in relation to estoppel is based upon the ground that it would generally be \ninequitable to permit the corporate existence of an association to be denied by persons who have \nrepresented it to be a corporation, or held it out as a corporation, or by any persons who have \nrecognized it as a corporation by dealing with it as such; and by the overwhelming weight of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n624 \nauthority, therefore, a person may be estopped to deny the legal incorporation of an association \nwhich is not even a corporation de facto. \n \nIn cases similar to the one at bar, involving a failure to file articles of incorporation, the courts of other \njurisdictions have held that where one has recognized the corporate existence of an association, he is \nestopped to assert the contrary with respect to a claim arising out of such dealings. \n \nSince I.B.M. is estopped to deny the corporate existence of the Bureau, we hold that Cranson was not \nliable for the balance due on account of the typewriters. \n \nJudgment reversed; the appellee to pay the costs. \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS",

A common type of corporate debt security is a bond, which is a promise to repay the face value of \nthe bond at maturity and make periodic interest payments called the coupon rate. For example, a bond \nmay have a face value of $1,000 (the amount to be repaid at maturity) and a coupon rate of 7 percent paid \nannually; the corporation pays $70 interest on such a bond each year. Bondholders have priority over \nstockholders because a bond is a debt, and in the event of bankruptcy, creditors have priority over equity \nholders. \n \nEquity Securities \nThe third source of new capital funds is equity securities—namely, stock. Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business. Stock is the smallest source of new capital but is of critical importance to the \ncorporation in launching the business and its initial operations. Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting.

The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation.

The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the \ndefinition in the 1933 and 1934 acts. Thus a security may be governed by the securities acts but not by the \nUCC. The definition of a private placement of securities also differs between the UCC and the securities \nacts. Other differences exist. [2] The UCC, as well as state-specific laws, and the federal securities laws \nshould all be considered in financial transactions. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe RMBCA advises doing away with financial concepts such as stock par value.

By this device, voting shares are given to voting trustees, who are empowered to vote the \nshares in accordance with the objectives set out in the trust agreement. Section 7.30 of the RMBCA limits \nthe duration of voting trusts to ten years. The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust.

These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions.

As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v.

For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations.

The full board of directors may, by majority, vote to delegate its authority to \ncommittees. \n \nDirectors owe the company a duty of loyalty and of care. A contract between a director and the company is \nvoidable unless fair to the corporation or unless all details have been disclosed and the disinterested \ndirectors or shareholders have approved. Any director or officer is obligated to inform fellow directors of \nany corporate opportunity that affects the company and may not act personally on it unless he has \nreceived approval. The duty of care is the obligation to act “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a \nlike position would exercise under similar circumstances.” Other fiduciary duties have also been \nrecognized, and constituency statutes permit the corporation to consider factors other than shareholders \nin making decisions.

Their inherent \nvalue lies in the interest in property or an ongoing enterprise that they represent. This disparity between \nthe tangible property—the stock certificate, for example—and the intangible interest it represents gives \nrise to several reasons for regulation. First, there is need for a mechanism to inform the buyer accurately \nwhat it is he is buying. Second, laws are necessary to prevent and provide remedies for deceptive and \nmanipulative acts designed to defraud buyers and sellers. Third, the evolution of stock trading on a \nmassive scale has led to the development of numerous types of specialists and professionals, in dealings \nwith whom the public can be at a severe disadvantage, and so the law undertakes to ensure that they do \nnot take unfair advantage of their customers. \n \nThe Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are two federal statutes that \nare vitally important, having virtually refashioned the law governing corporations during the past half \ncentury. In fact, it is not too much to say that although they deal with securities, they have become the \ngeneral federal law of corporations. This body of federal law has assumed special importance in recent \nyears as the states have engaged in a race to the bottom in attempting to compete with Delaware’s \npermissive corporation law (see Chapter 14 \"Corporation: General Characteristics and Formation\"). \n \nWhat Is a Security? \nSecurities law questions are technical and complex and usually require professional counsel. For the \nnonlawyer, the critical question on which all else turns is whether the particular investment or document \nis a security. If it is, anyone attempting any transaction beyond the routine purchase or sale through a \nbroker should consult legal counsel to avoid the various civil and criminal minefields that the law has \nstrewn about. \n \nThe definition of security, which is set forth in the Securities Act of 1933, is comprehensive, but it does \nnot on its face answer all questions that financiers in a dynamic market can raise.

But over the \nyears, the courts have permitted people injured by those who violate the statute to file private damage \nsuits. This sweeping rule has at times been referred to as the “federal law of corporations” or the “catch \neverybody” rule. \n \nInsider trading ran headlong into Rule 10b-5 beginning in 1964 in a series of cases involving Texas Gulf \nSulphur Company (TGS). On November 12, 1963, the company discovered a rich deposit of copper and \nzinc while drilling for oil near Timmins, Ontario. Keeping the discovery quiet, it proceeded to acquire \nmineral rights in adjacent lands. By April 1964, word began to circulate about TGS’s find. \n \nNewspapers printed rumors, and the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced a wild speculative spree. On \nApril 12, an executive vice president of TGS issued a press release downplaying the discovery, asserting \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n728 \nthat the rumors greatly exaggerated the find and stating that more drilling would be necessary before \ncoming to any conclusions. Four days later, on April 16, TGS publicly announced that it had uncovered a \nstrike of 25 million tons of ore. In the months following this announcement, TGS stock doubled in value. \n \nThe SEC charged several TGS officers and directors with having purchased or told their friends, so-\ncalled tippees, to purchase TGS stock from November 12, 1963, through April 16, 1964, on the basis of \nmaterial inside information. The SEC also alleged that the April 12, 1964, press release was deceptive. The \nUS Court of Appeals, in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., [2] decided that the defendants who purchased the \nstock before the public announcement had violated Rule 10b-5. According to the court, “anyone in \npossession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is",

There are two \nmain types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. In a cash merger, the shareholders of the \ndisappearing corporation surrender their shares for cash.

Many of the laws expressly gave management of the target companies a right to a hearing, which \ncould be dragged out for weeks or months, giving the target time to build up a defense. The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana second-\ngeneration statute that prevents an offeror who has acquired 20 percent or more of a target’s stock from \nvoting unless other shareholders (not including management) approve. The vote to approve can be \ndelayed for up to fifty days from the date the offeror files a statement reporting the acquisition. The Court \nconcluded that the Commerce Clause was not violated nor was the Williams Act, because the Indiana law, \nunlike the Illinois law in Mite, was consistent with the Williams Act, since it protects shareholders, does \nnot unreasonably delay the tender offer, and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts.

In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause.

We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to \nanother party to the instrument. It does not matter in what capacity she signs, whether as maker or \ncomaker, drawer or codrawer, or indorser. As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay). The extent of the accommodation party’s liability to pay depends on whether she has \nadded language specifying her purposes in signing. Section 3-416 of the UCC distinguishes between a \nguaranty of payment and a guaranty of collection. An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment. Only if the \njudgment is unsatisfied can the holder seek to collect from the accommodation party.

The draft is a three-party instrument whereby one person \n(drawer) directs a second (drawee) to pay money to the third (payee).

However, if \nthe only time fixed is on the occurrence of a contingent event, the time is not definite, even though the \nevent in fact has already occurred.

(A statute of limitations is a limit on the time a creditor has to file a \nlawsuit to collect the debt.) Section 3-118(1) of the UCC says that a lawsuit to enforce payment at a definite \ntime “must be commenced within six years after the due date” (or the accelerated due date). For demand \npaper, an action must be brought “within six years after the demand.” \n \nPayable to Order or Bearer \nAn instrument payable to order is one that will be paid to a particular person or organization identifiable \nin advance. To be payable to order, the instrument must so state, as most ordinarily do, by placing the \nwords “payable to order of” before the name of the payee.

Since defendant \nasserted an affirmative defense of fraud, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to establish the non-existence of \nany genuine issue of any material fact or the legal insufficiency of defendant’s affirmative defense. Having \nfailed to do so, plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law; hence, we reverse. \n \nThe note, incorporating by reference the terms of the mortgage, did not contain the unconditional \npromise to pay required by [the UCC]. Rather, the note falls within the scope of [UCC 3-106(a)(ii)]: “A \npromise or order is unconditional unless it states that…it is subject to or governed by any other writing.” \n \nPlaintiff Bank relies upon Scott v. Taylor [Florida] 1912 [Citation], as authority for the proposition that its \nnote is negotiable. Scott, however, involved a note which stated: “this note secured by mortgage.” Mere \nreference to a note being secured by mortgage is a common commercial practice and such reference in \nitself does not impede the negotiability of the note. There is, however, a significant difference in a note \nstating that it is “secured by a mortgage” from one which provides, “the terms of said mortgage are by this \nreference made a part hereof.” In the former instance the note merely refers to a separate agreement \nwhich does not impede its negotiability, while in the latter instance the note is rendered non-negotiable. \n \nAs a general rule the assignee of a mortgage securing a non-negotiable note, even though a bona fide \npurchaser for value, takes subject to all defenses available as against the mortgagee.

An \ninstrument “runs” to a person if (1) it has been issued to her or (2) it has been transferred to her by \nnegotiation (negotiation is the “post-issuance event” cited in the comment). Commercially speaking, the \nstatus of the immediate person to whom the instrument was issued (the payee) is not very interesting; the \nthing of interest is whether the instrument is passed on by the payee after possession, through \nnegotiation. Yes, the payee of an instrument is a holder, and can be a holder in due course, but the crux of \nnegotiable instruments involves taking an instrument free of defenses that might be claimed by anybody \nagainst paying on the instrument; the payee would know of defenses, usually, so—as the comment puts \nit—“use of the holder-in-due-course doctrine by the payee of an instrument is not the normal \nsituation.…[r]ather, the holder in due course is an immediate or remote transferee of the payee.” [2] \n \nLiability of Transferors \nWe discuss liability in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\".

There are two types of liability \naffecting transferors: contract liability and warranty liability. \n \nContract Liability \nPersons who sign the instrument—that is, makers, acceptors, drawers, indorsers—have signed a contract \nand are subject to contract liabilities. Drafts (checks) and notes are, after all, contracts. Makers and \nacceptors are primary parties and are unconditionally liable to pay the instrument. Drawers and \nindorsers are secondary parties and are conditionally liable. The conditions creating liability—that is, \npresentment, dishonor, and notice—are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n813 \n \nWarranty Liability \nThe transferor’s contract liability is limited.

Consequently, a holder who has not \nbeen paid often must resort to a suit based on one of five warranties. These warranties are implied by law; \nUCC, Section 3-416, details them: \n \n(A) A person who transfers an instrument for consideration warrants all of the following to the \ntransferee and, if the transfer is by indorsement, to any subsequent transferee: \n(1) The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the instrument. \n(2) All signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized. \n(3) The instrument has not been altered. \n(4) The instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which can be \nasserted against the warrantor. \n(5) The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to \nthe maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer. \n \nBreach of one of these warranties must be proven at trial if there is no general contract liability. \n \nLiability of Transferees \nThe transferee takes by assignment; as an assignee, the new owner of the instrument has only those rights \nheld by the assignor. Claims that could be asserted by third parties against the assignor can be asserted \nagainst the assignee. A negotiable instrument can be transferred in this sense without being negotiated. A \npayee, for example, might fail to meet all the requirements of negotiation; in that event, the instrument \nmight wind up being merely transferred (assigned). When all requirements of negotiability and \nnegotiation have been met, the buyer is a holder and may (if a holder in due course—see Chapter 21 \n\"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\") collect on the instrument without having to prove anything more. \nBut if the instrument was not properly negotiated, the purchaser is at most a transferee and cannot collect \nif defenses are available, even if the paper itself is negotiable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n814 \n \nHow Negotiation Is Accomplished \nNegotiation can occur with either bearer paper or order paper. \n \n \n \nNegotiation of Instrument Payable to Bearer \nAn instrument payable to bearer—bearer paper—can be negotiated simply by delivering it to the \ntransferee (see Figure 20.1 \"Negotiation of Bearer Paper\"; recall that “Lorna Love” is the proprietor of a",

A depositary bank that takes it must deposit it as directed, or the bank has converted it. A payor bank \nthat is also the depositary bank that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter \nconverts it: the check cannot be cashed; it must be deposited (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\"). \n \nTo illustrate, suppose that Kate Jones indorses her paycheck “For deposit only, Kate Jones,” which is by \nfar the most common type of restrictive indorsement (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", right).

Section 3-202(a) of the UCC declares that \nnegotiation is effective even when the indorsement is made by an infant or by a corporation exceeding its \npowers; is obtained by fraud, duress, or mistake; is part of an illegal transaction; or is made in breach of a \nduty. \n \nHowever, unless the instrument was negotiated to a holder in due course, the indorsement can be \nrescinded or subjected to another appropriate legal remedy. The Official Comment to this UCC section is \nhelpful: \n \nSubsection (a) applies even though the lack of capacity or the illegality is of a character which \ngoes to the essence of the transaction and makes it entirely void.

The \nprinciple finds its most extreme application in the well-settled rule that a holder in due course \nmay take the instrument even from a thief and be protected against the claim of the rightful \nowner. The policy of subsection (a) is that any person to whom an instrument is negotiated is a \nholder until the instrument has been recovered from that person’s possession.

But doing so discharges \nintervening parties as to the reacquirer and to later purchasers who are not holders in due course. Section \n3-207 of the UCC permits the reacquirer to cancel indorsements unnecessary to his title or ownership; in \nso doing, he eliminates the liability of such indorsers even as to holders in due course. \n \nInstruments Payable to Two or More Persons \nA note or draft can be payable to two or more persons.

As we have noted, though, negligence in the making or \nhandling of a negotiable instrument may cut off this defense against an HDC—as, for example, when a \ndrawer who uses a rubber signature stamp carelessly leaves it unattended. And notice, too, that Section 3-\n308 of the UCC provides that signatures are presumed valid unless their validity is specifically denied, at \nwhich time the burden shifts to the person claiming validity. These issues are discussed in Triffin v. \nSomerset Valley Bank, in Section 21.3 \"Cases\" of this chapter. \n \nBankruptcy \nDrawers, makers, and subsequent indorsers are not liable to an HDC if they have been discharged in \nbankruptcy. If they were, bankruptcy would not serve much purpose. \n \n \n \nInfancy \nWhether an infant’s signature on a negotiable instrument is a valid defense depends on the law of the \nstate. In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a \nparty. An alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration \nunless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. But a nonfraudulent alteration—for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n865 \nexample, filling in an omitted date or giving the obligor the benefit of a lower interest rate—does not \ndischarge the obligor.

Sheth contends that the trial court erred in \nfinding that Buckeye was a holder in due course of a postdated check drawn by Sheth and therefore was \nentitled to payment on the instrument despite the fact that Sheth had issued a stop-payment order to his \nbank. \n \nIn support of this assertion, Sheth argues that the trial court did not use the correct legal standard in \ngranting holder-in-due-course status to Buckeye. In particular, Sheth asserts that the trial court used the \npre-1990 Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) definition of “good faith” as it pertains to holder-in-due-\ncourse status, which defined it as “honesty in fact.” The definition of “good faith” was extended by the \nauthors of the UCC in 1990 to also mean “the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair \ndealing.” The post-1990 definition was adopted by the Ohio legislature in 1994. \n \nSheth argues that while Buckeye would prevail under the pre-1990, “honesty in fact” definition of “good \nfaith,” it failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner when it chose to cash the postdated check \ndrawn by Sheth. The lower court…adjudged Buckeye to be a holder in due course and, therefore, entitled \nto payment. We conclude that the trial court used the incorrect “good faith” standard when it granted \nholder-in-due-course status to Buckeye because Buckeye did not act in a commercially reasonable manner \nwhen it cashed the postdated check drawn by Sheth. Because we accept Sheth’s sole assignment of error, \nthe judgment of the trial court is reversed. \n \nOn or about October 12, 2003, Sheth entered into negotiations with James A. Camp for Camp to provide \ncertain services to Sheth by October 15, 2003. To that end, Sheth issued Camp a check for $1,300. The \ncheck was postdated to October 15, 2003. \n \nOn October 13, 2003, Camp negotiated the check to Buckeye and received a payment of $1,261.31. \nApparently fearing that Camp did not intend to fulfill his end of the contract, Sheth contacted his bank on \nOctober 14, 2003, and issued a stop-payment order on the check. Unaware of the stop-payment order, \nBuckeye deposited the check with its own bank on October 14, 2003, believing that the check would reach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

[Citation] Under that standard, absent fraudulent behavior, an \notherwise innocent party was assumed to have acted in good faith. The “honesty in fact” requirement, also \nknown as the “pure heart and empty head” doctrine, is a subjective test under which a holder had to \nsubjectively believe he was negotiating an instrument in good faith for him to become a holder in due \ncourse. Maine [Citation, 1999]. \n \nIn 1994, however, the Ohio legislature amended the definition of “good faith” to include not only the \nsubjective “honesty in fact” test, but also an objective test: “the observance of reasonable commercial \nstandards of fair dealing.” Ohio UCC 1-201(20). A holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective \nand an objective test of good faith. What constitutes “reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing” for \nparties claiming holder-in-due-course status, however, has not heretofore been defined in the state of \nOhio. \n \nIn support of his contention that Buckeye is not a holder in due course, Sheth cites a decision from the \nSupreme Court of Maine, [referred to above] in which the court provided clarification with respect to the \nobjective prong of the “good faith” analysis: \n \n“The fact finder must therefore determine, first, whether the conduct of the holder comported with \nindustry or ‘commercial’ standards applicable to the transaction and second, whether those \nstandards were reasonable standards intended to result in fair dealing. Each of those \ndeterminations must be made in the context of the specific transaction at hand. If the fact finder’s \nconclusion on each point is ‘yes,’ the holder will be determined to have acted in good faith even if, \nin the individual transaction at issue, the result appears unreasonable. Thus, a holder may be \naccorded holder in due course where it acts pursuant to those reasonable commercial standards \nof fair dealing—even if it is negligent—but may lose that status, even where it complies with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n875",

Hauser Co. appeals the grant of summary judgment.…We affirm. \n \nIn October 1998, Alfred M. Hauser, president of Hauser Co., was notified by Edwards Food Store in \nRaritan and the Somerset Valley Bank (the Bank), that several individuals were cashing what appeared to \nbe Hauser Co. payroll checks. Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments. Mr. Hauser \nconcluded that the checks were counterfeits because none of the payees were employees of Hauser Co., \nand because he did not write the checks or authorize anyone to sign those checks on his behalf. At that \ntime, Hauser Co. employed Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) to provide payroll services and a \nfacsimile signature was utilized on all Hauser Co. payroll checks. \n \nMr. Hauser executed affidavits of stolen and forged checks at the Bank, stopping payment on the checks at \nissue. Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn. All eighteen checks bore a red and green facsimile drawer’s signature stamp in the name of \nAlfred M. Hauser.

Understand that independent of contract liability, parties to negotiable instruments incur warranty liability. \n2. Know what warranties a person makes when she transfers an instrument. \n3. Know what warranties a person makes when he presents an instrument for payment or acceptance. \n4. Understand what happens if a bank pays or accepts a check by mistake. \n \n \nOverview of Warranty Liability \nWe discussed the contract liability of primary and secondary parties, which applies to those who sign the \ninstrument. Liability arises a second way, too—by warranty. A negotiable instrument is a type of property \nthat is sold and bought, just the way an automobile is, or a toaster. If you buy a car, you generally expect \nthat it will, more or less, work the way cars are supposed to work—that’s the implied warranty of \nmerchantability. Similarly, when an instrument is transferred from A to B for consideration, the \ntransferee (B) expects that the instrument will work the way such instruments are supposed to work. If A \ntransfers to B a promissory note made by Maker, B figures that when the time is right, she can go to \nMaker and get paid on the note. So A makes some implied warranties to B—transfer warranties. And \nwhen B presents the instrument to Maker for payment, Maker assumes that B as the indorsee from A is \nentitled to payment, that the signatures are genuine, and the like. So B makes some implied warranties to \nMaker—presentment warranties. Usually, claims of breach of warranty arise in cases involving forged, \naltered, or stolen instruments, and they serve to allocate the loss to the person in the best position to have \navoided the loss, putting it on the person (or bank) who dealt with the wrongdoer. We take up both \ntransfer and presentment warranties. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n902 \n \nTransfer Warranties \nTransfer warranties are important because—as we’ve seen—contract liability is limited to those who have \nactually signed the instrument. Of course, secondary liability will provide a holder with sufficient grounds \nfor recovery against a previous indorser who did not qualify his indorsement. But sometimes there is no \nindorsement, and sometimes the indorsement is qualified. Sometimes, also, the holder fails to make \ntimely presentment or notice of dishonor, thereby discharging a previous indorsee. In such cases, the",

If the reason she isn’t entitled to payment is because Payee’s signature \nwas forged by Thief, then Maker can go after Thief: the UCC says that “the person obtaining payment \n[Subsequent Party] and a prior transferor [Thief] warrant to the person making payment in good faith \n[Maker] that the warrantor [Subsequent Party] is entitled to enforce the instrument.” [5] Or, again, Drawer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n905 \nmakes the check out to Payee; Payee attempts to cash or deposit the check, but it is dishonored. Payee \npresents the check to Drawer to make it good: Payee warrants he is entitled to payment on it. \n \nWarranties cannot be disclaimed in the case of checks (because, as UCC Section 3-417, Comment 7, puts \nit, “it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be \nexamined by the payor bank”—they’re machine read). But a disclaimer of warranties is permitted as to \nother instruments, just as disclaimers of warranty are usually OK under general contract law. The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake. The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it \n(when there was), or that the drawer’s signature was authorized (when it was not), or that there were \nsufficient funds in the drawer’s account to pay it (when there were not), “the drawee may recover the \namount paid…or in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.” [6]Except—and it’s a big \nexception—such a recovery of funds does not apply “against a person who took the instrument in good \nfaith and for value.” [7] The drawee in that case would have to go after the forger, the unauthorized signer, \nor, in the case of insufficient funds, the drawer. Example: Able draws a check to Baker. Baker deposits the \ncheck in her bank account, and Able’s bank mistakenly pays it even though Able doesn’t have enough \nmoney in his account to cover it. Able’s bank cannot get the money back from Baker: it has to go after",

Discussion \nA. Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability. \nTransfer warranties trigger when a person transfers an instrument for consideration. UCC § 3-416(a)). A \ntransfer, for purposes of the statute, occurs when an instrument is delivered by a person other than its \nissuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. § 3-\n203(a). Martin transferred an instrument to PNC when he endorsed the check and deposited it in his \naccount, thereby granting PNC the right to enforce the check. [Citation] Consideration, for purposes of the \nstatute, need only be enough to support a simple contract. [Citation] Martin received consideration from \nPNC because PNC made the funds provisionally available before confirming whether First Century Bank \nwould honor the check. \n \nAs a warrantor, Martin made a number of representations to PNC, including representations that he was \nentitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. [UCC] § \n3-416(a). Martin breached his warranties twofold. First, he was not entitled to enforce the check because \nthe check was a counterfeit and, as a result, Martin had nothing to enforce. Second, the drawer’s signature \nwas not authentic because the check was a counterfeit. \n \nMartin does not dispute these facts. Instead, Martin argues, summary judgment is inappropriate because \nFriedman and Jennewein admitted that PNC made a mistake when Friedman said that he thought the \ncheck cleared and Jennewein said that she never would have authorized the wire transfer. Friedman’s and \nJennewein’s statements are immaterial facts. The transfer warranties placed the risk of loss on Martin, \nregardless of whether PNC, Martin, or both of them were at fault.

First, all but one of the cases were decided before the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Martin fails to argue, much less demonstrate, \nthat his cases are good law. Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss. Martin’s cases address who \nbears the risk of loss as between other players: a drawee bank and a collecting agent [Citation]; a drawer \nand a drawee bank [Citation]; and an execution creditor and drawee bank [Citation—all of these cases are \nfrom 1910–1930].

If for any reason Roger, or any appropriate party, wants a paper version, a substitute check will \nbe created (see Figure 23.1 \"Substitute Check Front and Back\"). Most often, though, that is not necessary: \nRoger does not receive the actual cancelled checks he wrote in his monthly statement as he did formerly. \nHe receives instead a statement listing paid checks he’s written and a picture of the check (not a substitute \ncheck) is available to him online through his bank’s website.

Under several provisions of Article 4, the bank is entitled to pay, \neven though the payment may be adverse to the customer’s interest. \n \nCommon Issues Arising between Banks and Their Customers \nPayment of Overdrafts \nSuppose a customer writes a check for a sum greater than the amount in her account. May the bank pay \nthe check and charge the customer’s account? Under Section 4-401(1), it may. Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n947 \n \nPayment of Deceased’s or Incompetent’s Checks \nSuppose a customer dies or is adjudged to be incompetent. May the bank honor her checks? Section 4-405 \npermits banks to accept, pay, and collect an item as long as it has no notice of the death or declaration of \nincompetence, and has no reasonable opportunity to act on it. Even after notice of death, a bank has ten \ndays to payor certify checks drawn on or prior to the date of death unless someone claiming an interest in \nthe account orders it to refrain from doing so. \n \n \n \nStop Payment Orders \nSection 4-403 expressly permits the customer to order the bank to “stop payment” on any check payable \nfor her account, assuming the stop order arrives in enough time to reasonably permit the bank to act on it. \nAn oral stop order is effective for fourteen days; a follow-up written confirmation within that time is \neffective for six months and can be renewed in writing.

See Section 23.4 \"Cases\" under \n“Bank’s Liability for Paying over Customer’s ‘Stop Payment’ Order” (Meade v. National Bank of Adams \nCounty). \n \nCustomers’ Duties \nIn order to hold a bank liable for paying out an altered check, the customer has certain duties under \nSection 4-406. Primarily, the customer must act promptly in examining her statement of account and \nmust notify the bank if any check has been altered or her signature has been forged. If the customer fails \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n948 \nto do so, she cannot recover from the bank for an altered signature or other term if the bank can show that \nit suffered a loss because of the customer’s slowness. Recovery may also be denied when there has been a \nseries of forgeries and the customer did not notify the bank within two weeks after receiving the first \nforged item. See Section 23.4 \"Cases\" under “Customer’s Duty to Inspect Bank Statements” (the Planters \nBank v. Rogers case). \n \nThese rules apply to a payment made with ordinary care by the bank.

Professor Jane Kaufman Winn described the development of uniform law \ngoverning commercial funds transfers: \n \nAlthough funds transfers conducted over funds transfer facilities maintained by the Federal \nReserve Banks were subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, many funds transfers \ntook place over private systems, such as the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems \n(“CHIPS”). The entire wholesale funds transfer system was not governed by a clear body of law \nuntil U.C.C. Article 4A was promulgated in 1989 and adopted by the states shortly thereafter. The \nArticle 4A drafting process resulted in many innovations, even though it drew heavily on the \npractices that had developed among banks and their customers during the 15 years before the \ndrafting committee was established. While a consensus was not easy to achieve, the community \nof interests shared by both the banks and their customers permitted the drafting process to find \nworkable compromises on many thorny issues.[1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n958 \nAll states and US territories have adopted Article 4A.

Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce. Suppose the parties do not stipulate a body of law for the agreement, and the \nvarious bodies of law conflict, what then? Julius is in New York and Rochelle is in Paris; does French law \nor New York law govern? The answer will depend on the particulars of the dispute. An American court \nmust determine under the applicable principles of the law of “conflicts of law” whether New York or \nFrench law applies. \n \nDomestic Law \nThe principal body of law applicable to the letter of credit in the United States is Article 5 of the UCC. \nSection 5-103 declares that Article 5 “applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations \narising out of transactions involving letters of credit.” The Official Comment to 5-101 observes, “A letter of \ncredit is an idiosyncratic form of undertaking that supports performance of an obligation incurred in a \nseparate financial, mercantile, or other transaction or arrangement.” And—as is the case in other parts of \nthe Code—parties may, within some limits, agree to “variation by agreement in order to respond to and \naccommodate developments in custom and usage that are not inconsistent with the essential definitions",

In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule.

When the agency and the consumer disagree about the validity of the information, the \nconsumer’s version must be placed in the file and included in future distributions of the report. After \nseven years, any adverse information must be removed (ten years in the case of bankruptcy). A person is \nentitled to one free copy of his or her credit report from each of the three main national credit bureaus \nevery twelve months. If a reporting agency fails to correct inaccurate information in a reasonable time, it \nis liable to the consumer for $1,000 plus attorneys’ fees. \n \nUnder the FCRA, any person who obtains information from a credit agency under false pretenses is \nsubject to criminal and civil penalties. The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. See Rodgers \nv. McCullough inSection 24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving use of information from a credit report. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCredit is an important part of the US economy, and there are various laws regulating its availability and",

Understand that consumers have the right to cancel some purchases made on credit. \n2. Know how billing mistakes may be corrected. \n3. Recognize that professional debt collectors are governed by some laws restricting certain practices. \n \n \nCancellation Rights \nOrdinarily, a contract is binding when signed. But consumer protection laws sometimes provide an escape \nvalve. For example, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation gives consumers three days to cancel \ncontracts made with door-to-door salespersons. Under this cooling-off provision, the cancellation is \neffective if made by midnight of the third business day after the date of the purchase agreement. The \nsalesperson must notify consumers of this right and supply them with two copies of a cancellation form, \nand the sales agreement must contain a statement explaining the right. The purchaser cancels by \nreturning one copy of the cancellation form to the seller, who is obligated either to pick up the goods or to \npay shipping costs. The three-day cancellation privilege applies only to sales of twenty-five dollars or more \nmade either in the home or away from the seller’s place of business; it does not apply to sales made by \nmail or telephone, to emergency repairs and certain other home repairs, or to real estate, insurance, or \nsecurities sales. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act (TILA) protects consumers in a similar way. For certain big-ticket purchases \n(such as installations made in the course of major home improvements), sellers sometimes require a \nmortgage (which is subordinate to any preexisting mortgages) on the home. The law gives such customers \nthree days to rescind the contract. Many states have laws similar to the FTC’s three-day cooling-off period, \nand these may apply to transactions not covered by the federal rule (e.g., to purchases of less than twenty-\nfive dollars and even to certain contracts made at the seller’s place of business). \n \nCorrecting Billing Mistakes \nBilling Mistakes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n998 \nIn 1975, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Billing Act as an amendment to the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act.

It was intended to put to an end the phenomenon, by then a standard part of any \ncomedian’s repertoire, of the many ways a computer could insist that you pay a bill, despite errors and \ndespite letters you might have written to complain. The act, which applies only to open-end credit and not \nto installment sales, sets out a procedure that creditors and customers must follow to rectify claimed \nerrors. The customer has sixty days to notify the creditor of the nature of the error and the amount. Errors \ncan include charges not incurred or those billed with the wrong description, charges for goods never \ndelivered, accounting or arithmetic errors, failure to credit payments or returns, and even charges for \nwhich you simply request additional information, including proof of sale. During the time the creditor is \nreplying, you need not pay the questioned item or any finance charge on the disputed amount. \n \nThe creditor has thirty days to respond and ninety days to correct your account or explain why your belief \nthat an error has been committed is incorrect. If you do turn out to be wrong, the creditor is entitled to all \nback finance charges and to prompt payment of the disputed amount.

The federal wage-\ngarnishment law limits the amount of employee earnings that may be withheld in any one pay date to the \nlesser of 25 percent of disposable (after-tax) earnings or the amount by which disposable weekly earnings \nexceed thirty times the highest current federal minimum wage. The federal law covers everyone who \nreceives personal earnings, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and retirement income \n(though not tips), but it allows courts to garnish above the federal maximum in cases involving support \npayments (e.g., alimony), in personal bankruptcy cases, and in cases where the debt owed is for state or \nfederal tax. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1000 \nThe federal wage-garnishment law also prohibits an employer from firing any worker solely because the \nworker’s pay has been garnished for one debt (multiple garnishments may be grounds for discharge). The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought. In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional.

However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977.",

Understand how the security interest is created—”attached”—and perfected. \n \n \n \nThe Problem of Security \nCreditors want assurances that they will be repaid by the debtor. An oral promise to pay is no security at \nall, and—as it is oral—it is difficult to prove. A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor \nto repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a \ndefaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security \nfor the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an \nagreement. \n \nBy Agreement with the Debtor \nSecurity obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most \ncommon form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated \nparty does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate. \n \nBy Operation of Law \nSecurity obtained through operation of law is known as a lien. Derived from the French for “string” or \n“tie,” a lien is the legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another in order to secure payment or \ndischarge an obligation. \n \nIn this chapter, we take up security interests in personal property and suretyship.

The \nUCC defines the scope of the article (here slightly truncated): [1] \n \nThis chapter applies to the following: \n1. A transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or \nfixtures by contract; \n2. An agricultural lien; \n3. A sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; \n4. A consignment… \n \nDefinitions \nAs always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is \npossible. The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a \nsecurity interest, and collateral. \n \nArticle 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1-201(35) \ndefines security interest as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or \nperformance of an obligation.” \n \nSecurity agreement is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract \nthat sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults. [2] \n \nCollateral “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.” [3] \n \nPurchase-money security interest (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest. Section 9-103(a) \nof the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money \nobligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the \ncreditor takes a secured interest in those goods.

It is \nwhat’s filed to establish the creditor’s “dibs.” \n \nContents of the Financing Statement \nIt may consist of the security agreement itself, as long as it contains the information required by the UCC, \nbut most commonly it is much less detailed than the security agreement: it “indicates merely that a person \nmay have a security interest in the collateral[.]…Further inquiry from the parties concerned will be \nnecessary to disclose the full state of affairs.” [26] The financing statement must provide the following \ninformation: \n \n• \nThe debtor’s name. Financing statements are indexed under the debtor’s name, so getting that \ncorrect is important. Section 9-503 of the UCC describes what is meant by “name of debtor.” \n• \nThe secured party’s name. \n• \nAn “indication” of what collateral is covered by the financing statement.[27] It may describe the \ncollateral or it may “indicate that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal \nproperty” (such generic references are not acceptable in the security agreement but are OK in the \nfinancing statement). [28] If the collateral is real-property-related, covering timber to be cut or \nfixtures, it must include a description of the real property to which the collateral is related.

[31] Manufactured-home filings are good for thirty years.

Generally, an interest \nremains perfected until the earlier of when the perfection would have expired or for four months after the \ndebtor moves to a new jurisdiction. [33] \n \nWhere to File the Financing Statement \nFor most real-estate-related filings—ore to be extracted from mines, agricultural collateral, and fixtures—\nthe place to file is with the local office that files mortgages, typically the county auditor’s office. [34] For \nother collateral, the filing place is as duly authorized by the state. In some states, that is the office of the \nSecretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that \nmaintains the state’s filing system. [35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or \nher primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered \norganization. [36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is \nalready encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office \nwill provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available \nfor at least some types of collateral. \n \nExemptions \nSome transactions are exempt from the filing provision.

On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would \nhave priority, because her filing was prior to Erika’s. \n \nWhat would happen if this kind of PMSI in noninventory goods (here, equipment) did not get priority \nstatus? A prudent Erika would not extend credit to Susan at all, and if the new machine is necessary for \nSusan’s business, she would soon be out of business. That certainly would not inure to the benefit of \nRosemary. It is, mostly, to Rosemary’s advantage that Susan gets the machine: it enhances Susan’s ability \nto make money to pay Rosemary. \n \n(2) Purchase-money security interest in inventory. The UCC provides that a perfected PMSI in inventory \nhas priority over conflicting interests in the same inventory, provided that the PMSI is perfected when the \ndebtor receives possession of the inventory, the PMSI-secured party sends an authenticated notification \nto the holder of the conflicting interest and that person receives the notice within five years before the \ndebtor receives possession of the inventory, and the notice states that the person sending it has or expects \nto acquire a PMSI in the inventory and describes the inventory.

It is usually to the earlier creditor’s advantage that her debtor is able to get credit to “floor” \n(provide) inventory, without selling which, of course, the debtor cannot pay back the earlier creditor. \n \n(3) Purchase-money security interest in fixtures. Under UCC Section 9-334(e), a perfected security in \nfixtures has priority over a mortgage if the security interest is a PMSI and the security interest is perfected \nby a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days after. A mortgagee is usually a \nbank (the mortgagor is the owner of the real estate, subject to the mortgagee’s interest). The bank’s \nmortgage covers the real estate and fixtures, even fixtures added after the date of the mortgage (after-\nacquired property clause). In accord with the general rule, then, the mortgagee/bank would normally have \npriority if the mortgage is recorded first, as would a fixture filing if made before the mortgage was \nrecorded. But with the exception noted, the bank’s interest is subordinate to the fixture-seller’s later-\nperfected PMSI. Example: Susan buys a new furnace from Heating Co. to put in her house. Susan gave a \nbank a thirty-year mortgage on the house ten years before. Heating Co. takes back a PMSI and files the \nappropriate financing statement before or within twenty days of installation. If Susan defaults on her loan \nto the bank, Heating Co. would take priority over the bank. And why not? The mortgagee has, in the long \nrun, benefited from the improvement and modernization of the real estate. (Again, there are further \nnuances in Section 9-334 beyond our scope here.) A non-PMSI in fixtures or PMSIs perfected more than \ntwenty days after goods become a fixture loses out to prior recorded interests in the realty. \n \nOther Exceptions \nWe have noted the three immediate exceptions to the general rule that “the firstest with the mostest” \nprevails.

For example (based on \nexample 1 to the same comment, UCC 9-320, Official Comment 3), Manufacturer makes \nappliances and owns manufacturing equipment covered by a perfected security agreement in \nfavor of Lender. Manufacturer sells the equipment to Dealer, whose business is buying and selling \nused equipment; Dealer, in turn, sells the stuff to Buyer, a buyer in the ordinary course.

If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities.

However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you.

Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.",

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short.

Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements.

Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse. The parable demonstrates how individuals can make absolute truths from their own\nlimited and subjective information. Financial decision makers run a similar risk, if they choose to recognize\nonly their own findings and ignore other microeconomic or macroeconomic information and the interaction of\nthese factors.\nA common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and\nmicroeconomics is a bottom-up approach.

                    "answer": "Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different fields of economics that are related to each other. Microeconomics deals with the behavior of individuals and firms in the economy, while macroeconomics deals with the economy as a whole. Microeconomics is concerned with the behavior of individual markets and how they interact with each other, while macroeconomics is concerned with the overall economy and how it functions. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are interrelated because the behavior of individual markets and firms can have an impact on the overall economy, and the overall economy can have an impact on individual markets and firms. For example, if there is a recession in the overall economy, it can have an impact on individual firms and markets, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important for financial decision makers to consider both microeconomic and macroeconomic factors when making decisions."

Defaulting on money\nmarket instruments is not unheard of, but it is very rare. “High liquidity” means that money market\ninstruments can generally be sold in a secondary market very quickly and at or near their current market\nvalue.

Compare that to the purchase of physical assets such as a car or\nhouse, where each of the assets sold has some unique feature or measure of quality.\nFinancial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs\nissue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess\nof $100,000.

However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds\nmarket by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending\nrates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.\nCapital Markets and Instruments\nThe capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the\nmoney market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high, and\nliquidity is less certain, as is the homogeneity of the financial instruments.

They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (“munis”).\nLocal borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.\nThus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond",

Here we are over 100 years later, and the Dow 30 index is alive and well. Of course, the 30 companies\nhave changed, but the index does represent a continuous yardstick to measure stock performance over\ntime. As Table 1.1 shows, it took from 1906 to 1972, or a little over 66 years, for the Dow 30 to increase\ntenfold, from a value of 100 to a value of 1,000. The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a\nlittle under 27 years from 1972 to 1999.

Even though this is a business finance text,\nsometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, Table 1.2 demonstrates four different\ninvestment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account\nearning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost\ncertainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate\nroughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!\nCompare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per\nyear from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an\nannual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However,\ndespite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate\nof return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369. Her total is almost as great as the amount\nyou would accumulate, but with a much smaller total investment.\nScenarios 3 and 4 are even more dramatic, as can be seen from a review of Table 1.2. In both scenarios, only\nfive $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor’s life. Parents or grandparents\ncould make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts\ngreater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments.

However, data today is more\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\nfor their stakeholders.\n1.4 Careers in Finance\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\nto manufacturing, to education.\n1.5 Markets and Participants\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources.

In\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\nSome examples of these might include the following:\n•\nExpanding sales to existing customers\n•\nIncreasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\n•\nDeveloping new products for current and potential customers\n•\nBecoming international by setting up an online ordering service\nCorporate Structure and Governance\n2\n2 • Why It Matters\n39\n•\nImproving customer satisfaction with customer services\nIf managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in\nthe first place.

If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners.

In order to begin the process of\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\narticles of incorporation include the following:\n•\nDomestic corporation (in state)\n•\nForeign corporation (out of state or out of country)\n•\nClose (closely held) corporation\n•\nProfessional corporation\n•\nNonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\n•\nStock corporation\n•\nNon-stock corporation\n•\nPublic benefit corporation\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\n2.2\nRelationship between Shareholders and Company Management\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between principals and agents.\n•",

Though both common shareholders\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\nRole of Management\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\n(BOD).

Boards now oversee the monitoring\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits.

It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice.

As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be\nresolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.\nEvery company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and\npersonal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders\n(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own\nwealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the\ngoodwill of the shareholder base.\nThere are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nExample of an Agency Problem\nABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the\nselling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own\npersonal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price\nof the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.\nAdditionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall\nquality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced\nbetween stockholders and loyal customers of the company.\nStockholders versus Management\nLarge corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential\nfor an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type\nof agency problem.\nSegregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not\nhave any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts\nand professionals to manage key operations of the business.\nHowever, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.\nExternal managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even\n50\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmisusing company funds. This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.",

When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any\ngulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it\nis recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also\nrecognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.\nImpact of ESG Ratings\nIn recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being\nevaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These ratings and\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal\nimportance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per Figure 2.3 below. It is critical for the senior management\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\nwhen necessary.\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\ncompany. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to\n2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards\n53\nrepresent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term\nvalue of company stock.\nThus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a",

IR was developed to take responsibility for achieving and maintaining these\ncrucial relationships.\nInvestor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm’s IR group must work very\nclosely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team,\nsuch as the CEO and CFO.\nAs might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely\ndue to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and the International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS).

SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial\nscandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier.\nIn summary, investor relations functions have responsibilities including, but not limited to,\n•\ncoordinating live shareholder meetings and press conferences;\n•\ndisseminating financial information to the investment community;\n•\nconducting briefings to the financial analyst community;\n•\npublishing the quarterly report and annual report; and\n•\naddressing any issues that arise as a result of financial disclosure.\nThe best time to form an internal IR function or to engage an IR firm is when a company begins the process of\nbecoming publicly traded through an initial public offering, or IPO.\nQuarterly Earnings Conference Calls\nAs a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all publicly traded companies are required to file certain\n54\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfinancial reports with the SEC.

The interactions of the decisions that businesses and customers make will determine the\nprice and quantity of a good or service that is sold in the marketplace. Financial managers need a strong\nfoundation in microeconomics. This foundation helps them understand the market for the company’s\nproducts and services, including pricing considerations. Microeconomics also helps managers understand the\navailability and prices of resources that are necessary for the company to create its products and services.\nA successful business cannot just create and manufacture a product or provide a service; it must produce a\nproduct or service that customers will purchase. Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).",

A demand curve is drawn\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing. This assumption is, as\nmentioned above, ceteris paribus.\nIf another relevant economic factor changes, the demand curve can change. Relevant economic factors would\ninclude consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price\nof other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza\nnight for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase.\nIf the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher.

This could happen if people’s tastes\nand preferences changed. If there were, for example, increased publicity about pizza being an unhealthy food\nchoice, some individuals would choose healthier alternatives and consume less pizza.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDemand Curve Shifts\nIf any of the items that are assumed not to change when a demand curve is drawn do change, then the\ndemand curve can shift. To learn more about these changes in demand, watch the MRU video on demand\ncurve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video).\nSupply\nSupply is the quantity of a good or service that firms are willing to sell at various prices, during a given time\nperiod, ceteris paribus.

Because a higher price\nencourages suppliers to sell more pizzas, the supply curve will be upward sloping.\nFigure 3.4 Supply Curve for Pizzas\nThe supply curve isolates the relationship between the price of pizzas and the quantity of pizzas supplied. All\nother relevant economic factors are assumed to remain unchanged when the curve is drawn. If a factor such\nas the cost of cheese or the salaries paid to workers changes, then the supply curve will move.

If the price of a\npizza were $20, suppliers would make 40 pizzas available, but the quantity of pizzas demanded would be only\n20 pizzas. This would be a surplus, or excess quantity supplied, of pizzas. Restaurant owners who see that they\nhave 40 pizzas to sell but can only sell 20 of those pizzas will lower their prices to encourage more customers\nto purchase pizzas. At the same time, the restaurant owners will cut back on their pizza production. This\nprocess will drive the pizza price down from $20 toward the equilibrium price.\nThe opposite would occur if the price of a pizza were only $5. Customers may want to purchase 50 pizzas, but\nrestaurants would only want to sell 10 pizzas at the low price. Quantity demanded would exceed quantity\nsupplied.

Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls.

GDP measures the value of all of\nthe automobiles produced, apples grown, heart surgeries performed, students educated, and all other new\ngoods and services produced in a current year.\nHow Is GDP Measured?\nGDP can be measured by adding up all of the items that are purchased in the economy. Purchases are divided\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\nexports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,\ncups of coffee, and clothing. Consumption expenditure accounts for about two-thirds of the US GDP.4\nInvestment spending refers primarily to purchases by businesses. It is important to note that in this context,\nthe term investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial securities.

Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States.

If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP.

If the bank quotes an interest rate of\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation.

The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\n3.4 • Interest Rates\n87",

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a",

Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\nCash-Basis Accounting\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris",

Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\n102\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexpense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\nWho Uses Each Method?\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is",

While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\n104\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSeptember rather than in August.

This stream of\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\nThe Accounting Equation\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance. Therefore, we must\nensure that the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. We will explore the components of the\naccounting equation in more detail shortly.

Journals are useful tools to meet this need.\nDebits and Credits\nEach account can be represented visually by splitting the account into left and right sides as shown. The\ngraphic representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-account. It is called this because it looks\nlike a “T,” as you can see with the T-account shown in Figure 4.3.\nFigure 4.3 T-Account\nA debit records financial information on the left side of each account. A credit records financial information on\nthe right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease. The\nending account balance is found by calculating the difference between debits and credits for each account.\nYou will often see the terms debit and credit represented in shorthand, written as DR or dr and CR or cr,\nrespectively. Depending on the account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary.

Just as the $1,400 revenues\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as\nearning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or\npayments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar\nvalue of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCoffee Shop Products\nThink about a coffee shop in your area.

Or, better yet, make a trip to the local coffee shop and get a first-hand experience.\nSolution:\nMany coffee shops earn revenue through multiple revenue streams, including coffee and other specialty\ndrinks, food items, gift cards, and merchandise.\nShort-Term Revenue Recognition Examples\nTwo brief examples may help illustrate the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting.\nAssume that a business sells $200 worth of merchandise. In some businesses, there are two ways the\ncustomers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards\nand are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer\nto take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.\nA cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of\naccounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the\nsame time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nA credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash\nbasis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,\nunder terms stipulated by the seller.

The American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\nrevenue recognition.\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until\ncustomer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you\nrecognize revenue?\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\ngovernment.\nExpense Recognition\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers.

Liam has a lot of information to consider before making this decision.\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\n111\nWhat Is a Fixed Asset?\nAn asset is considered a tangible asset when it is an economic resource that has physical substance—it can\nbe seen and touched. Tangible assets can be either short term, such as inventory and supplies, or long term,\nsuch as land, buildings, and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset, the item needs to be\nused in the normal operation of the business for more than one year, be of material value, and not be near the\nend of its useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item in the near future. The useful life is\nthe time period over which an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known as fixed assets. It’s\nalso key to note that companies will capitalize a fixed asset if they have material value. A $10 stapler to be\nused in the office, for example, may last for years, but the value of the item is not significant enough to\nwarrant capitalizing it.\nBusinesses typically need many different types of these assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ\nfrom the company’s products. For example, the computers that Apple, Inc. intends to sell are considered\ninventory (a short-term asset), whereas the computers Apple’s employees use for day-to-day operations are\nlong-term assets. In Liam’s case, the new silk screen machine would be considered a long-term tangible asset\nas they plan to use it over many years to help generate revenue for their business. Long-term tangible assets\nare listed as noncurrent assets on a company’s balance sheet. Typically, these assets are listed under the\ncategory of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as fixed assets or plant assets.\nApple, Inc. lists a total of $36.766 million in total Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) on its September 2020\nconsolidated balance sheet (see Figure 4.7).

Under normal circumstances, this might have been considered just\nanother accounting fiasco leading to the end of a company. However, WorldCom controlled a large\npercentage of backbone routes, a major component of the hardware supporting the internet, as even the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission recognized. If such an event were to happen today, it could shut\ndown international commerce and would be considered a national emergency.10 As demonstrated by\nWorldCom, the unethical behavior of a few accountants could have shut down the world’s online\nbusinesses and international commerce.

                    "answer": "In accounting, profit is the difference between a company’s revenue and expenses. If a company’s revenue is greater than its expenses, the company makes a profit. If a company’s expenses are greater than its revenue, the company loses money. Losses can be viewed as negative profits. A company’s profit or loss for a given period of time is often referred to as net income or net earnings. Net income is the company’s profit after all expenses and taxes are paid. A company’s net income is reported in its income statement. The income statement shows a company’s revenue, expenses, and net income for a specific period of time, such as a month, quarter, or year. The income statement is one of the most important financial statements a company prepares. It shows a company’s financial performance for a specific period of time. The income statement helps investors, creditors, and other interested parties understand a company’s financial health and make decisions about whether to invest in or lend money to the company."

While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\nProfit versus Cash Flow\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the",

Stakeholders need to know the financial performance (as measured by\nthe income statement—that is, net income or net loss) and financial position (as measured by the balance\nsheet—that is, assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) of the business. This information is provided in the\nincome statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. However, since these financial statements\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing.

The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net\nincome (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.\n4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\n123\nSummary\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\naccounting.

Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual-basis accounting\nan accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\nwhen paid\ncapitalize",

The statement helps\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\nrather than a net loss.\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\nbusiness.

The classified\nbalance sheet shows the financial state of a company as of a specific point in time. It is a key distinction\nbetween the two statements. The classified balance sheet is prepared in sections that align with the\naccounting equation.\nRemember, the accounting equation reflects the assets (items owned by the organization) and how they\nwere obtained (by incurring liabilities or provided by owners). Liabilities are debts owed to other parties.\nStated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nThe classified balance sheet is thus broken down into three sections; assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. If\n134\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nprepared correctly, the total assets on the balance sheet equals the total liabilities and owner’s equity sections\nof the balance sheet.\nThe classified balance sheet is considered or termed classified when the assets and liabilities within the\nbalance sheet are grouped into even smaller sections: current and noncurrent (see Figure 5.6).

A manufacturer, like Apple, Inc. in the\nLink to Learning sections, will have a variety of inventory types including raw materials, work in progress, and\nfinished goods inventory. These represent the various states of the inventory (ready to use, partially complete,\nand fully completed product). A service firm, on the other hand, may not have inventory at all. If it does, it may\nbe simple goods it uses to help deliver its service.

The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable?

The indirect method begins with net income and\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\nfixed assets).

They did, however, cause an impact to\ncash flow (see Figure 5.17).\nDuring the current year, Clear Lake purchased an additional $5,000 in short-term investments (see the\ncomparative balances sheets; the balance in that account increased by $5,000 since the prior year).

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task.

A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements.

Expressing\neach item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to\nmake comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes. The formula to calculate\neach item on the income statement is:\nUsing Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year income statement, we can see how each line item in it is divided\nby net sales in order to assemble a common-size income statement (see Figure 5.20).\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n149\nFigure 5.20 Common-Size Income Statement\nIt may seem cumbersome to create a common-size statement.

This makes it easier to compare figures from one period to the next,\ncompare departments within an organization, and compare the firm to other companies of any size as well as\nindustry averages. On the income statement, analysts can see how much of sales revenue is spent on each\ntype of expense. They can see this breakdown for each firm and compare how different firms function in terms\nof expenses, proportionally. They can also look at the percentage for each expense over time to see if they are\nspending more or less on certain areas of the business, such as research and development. On the balance\nsheet, analysts commonly look to see the percentage of debt and equity to determine capital structure. They\ncan also quickly see the percentage of current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities.\nIn Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement for the current and prior years, we can see that\ncost of goods as a percentage of sales remained the same (see Figure 5.24).

Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers.

In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value\ntomorrow.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will\npay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year\nfrom now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\nturns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is\n$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that\ntime. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the\nprincipal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\nBy taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a\ntotal value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to\n$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that\n$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss\ninterest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can\nconsider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds\nand/or charged to the borrower of these same funds. Following are a few more examples of the single-period\nscenario.\nIf a person deposits $300 in an account that pays 5% per year, at the end of one year, they will have\nIf a company has earnings of $2.50 per share and experiences a 10% increase in the following year, the\nearnings per share in year two are\nIf a retail store decides on a 3% price increase for the following year on an item that is currently selling for $50,\nthe new price in the following year will be\nThe Impact of Compounding\nWhat would happen if your friend were willing to wait one more year to receive their lump sum payment?\nWhat would the future dollar value in their account be after a two-year period? Returning to our earlier\nexample, assume that during the second year, your friend leaves the principal ($1,000) and the earned interest\n($40) in the account, thereby reinvesting the entire account balance for another year.

This will have the effect of accelerating the growth of the total dollar value of the\naccount.\nThis is the important effect of the compounding of interest: money grows in larger and larger increments the\nlonger you leave it in an interest-bearing account. In effect, the compounding of interest over time accelerates\nthe growth of money.\nIn order to determine the FV of any amount of money, it will always be necessary to know the following pieces\nof information: (1) the principal, initial deposit, or present value (PV); (2) the rate of interest, usually\nexpressed on an annual basis as r; and (3) the number of time periods that the money will remain in the\naccount (n). The interest rate is often referred to as the growth rate, or the annual percentage increase on\nsavings or on an investment. When the rate is raised to the power of the number of periods, the formula\nwill yield a number that is commonly referred to as the future value interest factor (FVIF). As a result\nof this process, as n (time, or the number of periods) increases, the future value interest factor will increase.\nAlso, as r (interest rate) increases, the FVIF will increases. For these reasons, the future value calculation is\ndirectly determined by both the interest rate being used and the total amount of time—specifically, the\nnumber of periods—being considered.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Future Values\nHere’s another example of calculating future values in multiple-period scenarios.",

This is because most financial calculators\n(and spreadsheets) follow something called the cash flow sign convention, which is a way for calculators and\nspreadsheets to keep the relative direction of the cash flow straight. Positive numbers are used to represent\ncash inflows, and negative numbers should always be used for cash outflows.\nIn this example, the $1,000 is an investment that requires a cash outflow. For this reason, -1000 is entered as\nthe present value, as you will be essentially handing this $1,000 to a bank or to someone else to initiate the\ntransaction. Conversely, the future value represents a cash inflow in four years’ time. This is why the calculator\ngenerates a positive 1,125.51 as the end result of this calculation.\nHad you entered the present value of $1,000 as a positive number, there would have been no real concern, but\nthe ending future value answer would have been returned expressed as a negative number. This would be\ncorrect had you borrowed $1,000 today (cash inflow) and agreed to repay $1,125.51 (cash outflow) four years\nfrom now. Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the -- (minus) key).\nFor example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the +|-\n+|- key instead of the minus key. If you\nenter 1000 and then hit the +|-\n+|- key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.\nAn important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a\nproblem without needing to reenter all of the other data. For example, suppose that we wanted to find out the\nfuture value in our bank account if we left the money from our previous example invested for 20 years instead\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n198\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof 4.

Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to\nincreased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the\ncosts of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\nConsumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it\nnow, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a\ndecision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\ninflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in\ntimes when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing\npower erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\nnow in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through\ninterest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\nLower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed\nas the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on\nto sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money\nless expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and\nservices they may require. We have also seen that the more quickly inflation rates rise, the more quickly the\ngeneral purchasing power of money will be eroded. Rational investors who set money aside for the future will\ndemand higher interest rates to compensate them for such periods of inflation.

Second, it affects interest rates, which in turn affects investment and spending decisions. Third, it affects inflation, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services."

When\ninterest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury and money market investments due\nto their extremely poor returns.\nIt soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and\ndirect impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples",

In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\nrate.

So, this ends up being a bit of a\nrisk, but one that you have considered. The idea is that you are hoping for a more significant payoff down the\nroad than if you had made the decision not to continue with your studies.

Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\nThe idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.\nTVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the\nfuture. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money\nearly can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects\nof inflation.

Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity?

Although a\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\nBy substitution,\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try.

The answer is\n, or $30.17.\nSome investments might involve a growing perpetuity. In this case, some degree of change in the amount of\nthe dividend is expected. The formula is altered slightly to include a rate of growth in the denominator, noted\nas G, making the growing perpetuity formula\n8.1 • Perpetuities\n229\nTo illustrate a growing perpetuity, let’s revisit Rooney Corp.’s stock, with its annual dividend of $1.75 and a\nrequired rate of return in the market of 5.8%. If the expected dividend growth rate G is 1.2%, then the value\nchanges to\n, or $38.04. The expectation of growth in the dividend provides incentive for the\ninvestor to pay a higher price.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nA Growing Perpetuity\nSavo Corporation. While we think of perpetuities as being static, with a constant benefit or dividend, as\nseen above, they might have the possibility of growth.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\ninterest from past periods.\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we\ndeposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the\nbeginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at\nthe end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity. Because the first payment will be received one year\nfrom now, we specifically call this an ordinary annuity. We will look at an alternative to ordinary annuities\nlater.

If we\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission\nis offering you instead.\nBy substitution, and following the proper order of operations:\nAll things being equal, that expected future stream of ten $120,000 payments is worth approximately $770,119\ntoday. Now you can compare like numbers, and the $787,000 cash lump sum is worth more than the\ndiscounted future payments. That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as\ntaxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.\n8.2 • Annuities\n233\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nEarlier, we defined an ordinary annuity. A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,",

For example, if we have an annuity due with a payment of $1000 per year for 5 years, the annuity due will have 4 periods while the ordinary annuity will have 5 periods. This is because the annuity due starts paying immediately while the ordinary annuity starts paying one period after the start of the annuity."

When the result is expressed as a\npercent, it must be the same as the rate of interest used in the annuity calculations. Using our example of an\nannuity with five payments of $25,000 at 8%, we compare the present values of the ordinary annuity of\n$99,817.81 and the annuity due of $107,803.24.\nThe result shows that the present value of the annuity due is 8% higher than the present value of the ordinary\nannuity.\nCalculating the Future Value of an Annuity\nIn the previous section, we addressed discounting a periodic stream of payments from the future to the\npresent. We are also interested in how to project the future value of a series of payments. In this case, an\ninvestment may be made periodically. Keeping with the definition of an annuity, if the amount of periodic\ninvestment is always the same, we may take a one-step shortcut to calculate the future value of that stream by\nusing the formula presented below:\nwhere FVa is the future value of the annuity, PYMT is a one-time payment or receipt in the series, r is the\ninterest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nAs we did in our section on present values of annuities, we will begin with an ordinary annuity and then\nproceed to an annuity due.\nLet’s assume that you lock in a contract for an investment opportunity at 4% per year, but you cannot make\nthe first investment until one year from now. This is counterintuitive for an investor, perhaps, but because it is\nthe basis of the formula and procedures for ordinary annuities, we will accept this assumption. You plan to\ninvest $3,000 at the end of each year. How much money will you have at the end of five years?\nLet’s start by placing this on a timeline like the one appearing earlier in this chapter (see Table 8.3):\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nBalance Forward ($) 0.00\n0.00 3,000.00 6,120.00\n9,364.80 12,739.39\nInterest Earned ($)\n0.00\n120.00\n244.80\n374.59\n509.58\nPrincipal Added ($)\n3,000.00 3,000.00 3,000.00\n3,000.00\n3,000.00\nNew Balance ($)\n3,000.00 6,120.00 9,364.80 12,739.39 16,248.97\nTable 8.3\n236\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAs we explained earlier when describing ordinary annuities, the payment for year 1 is not invested until the",

As noted, we will\nfocus on fixed-rate debts, such as auto loans, personal loans with installment payments, or mortgages. Before\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into\nbusiness or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area of Time Value of Money I.\nWe’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a\nmonthly basis.

Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance.

What will the amount of\nyour monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s\nprove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of\nan annuity formula.

If a stream of payments occurs in\nwhich the amount of the payments changes at any point, the techniques for solving for annuities must be\nmodified. Shortcuts that we have seen in earlier chapters cannot be taken. Fortunately, with tools such as\nfinancial or online calculators and Microsoft Excel, the method can be quite simple.\nThe ability to analyze and understand cash flow is essential. From a personal point of view, assume that you\nhave an opportunity to invest $2,000 every year, beginning next year, to save for a down payment on the\npurchase of your first home seven years from now. In the third year, you also inherit $10,000 and put it all\ntoward this goal. In the fifth year, you receive a large bonus of $3,000 and also dedicate this to your ongoing\ninvestment.\nThe stream of regular payments has been interrupted—which is, of course, good news for you. However, it\ndoes add a new complexity to the math involved in finding values related to time, whether compounding into\nthe future or discounting to the present value. Analysts refer to such a series of payments as a mixed stream.\nIf you make the first payment on the first day of next year and continue to do so on the first day of each\nfollowing year, and if your investment will always be earning 7% interest, how much cash will you have\naccumulated—principal plus earned interest—at the end of the seven years?\nThis is a future value question, but because the stream of payments is mixed, we cannot use annuity formulas\nor approaches and the shortcuts they provide. As noted in previous chapters, when solving a problem\ninvolving the time value of money, a timeline and/or table is helpful. The cash flows described above are\nshown in Table 9.1 . Remember that all money is assumed to be deposited in your investment at the beginning\nof each year.

Keeping in mind that we have not yet\nexplored the use of Excel, is there another way to view our solution? The problem above takes each annual\ninvestment and compounds it into the future, then adds the results of each calculation to find the total future\nvalue of the stream of payments.\nBut when you break the problem down, another way to look at the problem is as a five-year annuity of $10,000\nper year plus added payments in years 4 and 5. Can we solve for the future value of an annuity first and then\nperform two separate calculations on the additional amounts ($5,000 each in years 4 and 5)? Yes, we can.\nLet’s summarize:\n•\nFuture value of a $10,000 annuity due, 4%, 5 years, plus\n•\nFuture value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 2 years, plus\n•\nFuture value of a single payment of $5,000, 4%, 1 year\nThis must give us the same result.

We will begin with a\npersonal example. You win a cash windfall through your state’s lottery. You would like to take a portion of the\nfunds and place them in a fixed investment so that you can draw $17,000 per year starting one year from now\nand continue to do so for the next two years. At the end of year 4, you want to withdraw $17,500, and at the\nend of year 5, you will withdraw the last $18,000 to close the account. When you take your last payment of\n$18,000, your fund will be totally depleted. You will always be earning 6% annually. How much of your cash\nwindfall should you set aside today to accomplish this?\nLet us break down the problem, remembering that we are thinking in reverse from the earlier problems that\ninvolved future values. In this case, we’re bringing future values back in time to find their present values. You\nwill recall that this process is called discounting rather than compounding.\nRegardless of how we solve this, the question remains the same: How much money must we invest today\n(present value) to achieve this? And remember that we will always be earning 6% compounded annually on\nany invested balances.\n9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows\n267\nWe are calculating present values as we did in previous chapters, given a known future value “target,” in order\nto determine how much money you need today to achieve that goal.

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments",

When the Future Value function is used to calculate the future value of a series of cash flows, the first cash flow is the present value, which is the value of the cash flow at the start of the first period.

These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING",

Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors.

The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate.

These bond investors are aware that when\ninterest rates rise, their bond investments will lose value. This is not the case with floating- or variable-rate\nbonds.\nBonds with very low coupon rates are referred to as deep discount bonds. Of course, the bond that has the\ngreatest discount is the zero-coupon bond, with a coupon rate of zero.

While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,",

This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\ncompared to stocks.\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n291\nWhile yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are\ncurrently low because the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) has kept interest rates low for several years,\ninvestors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.2 This is especially true as investors enter their\nretirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks. Because income from most bonds is fixed, such instruments can have\ntheir values eroded by external factors such as interest rates and inflation. We will discuss some of these risks\nafter the next section.\nPeriod\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nEnd Date 6/30/20 12/31/20 6/30/21 12/31/21 6/30/22 12/31/22 6/30/23 12/31/23 6/30/24 12/31/24\nCoupon\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\nPrincipal\n$100,000\nTable 10.4\nTable 10.4 shows the cash inflow of a five-year, 9%, $100,000 corporate bond dated January 1, 2020.

The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-",

Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates.

An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but",

However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by\ncompanies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate\nincome and eventual value for individual investors.\nWith common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will\nreceive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•",

One of the most consistently used calculations in this\nanalysis, which has important applications in company and common stock evaluation, is the price-to-earnings\n(P/E) ratio.\nThe P/E ratio is computed using the following formula:\n320\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe P/E ratio is extremely useful to analysts in that it shows the expectations of the market. Essentially, the P/E\nratio is representative of the price an investor must pay for every unit of current (or future) corporate\nearnings.\nBottom-line earnings are a critical factor in valuing common stock. Investors will always want to know how\nprofitable a company is now as well as how profitable it will be in the future. When a company’s bottom line\nremains relatively flat over a period of time, leaving earnings per share (EPS) relatively unchanged, the P/E\nratio can be interpreted as the payback period for the original amount paid for each share of common stock.\nFor example, the common stock price of Cameo Corp. is currently at $24.00 a share, and its EPS for the year is\n$4.00. Cameo’s P/E ratio is calculated as\nThis ratio would typically be expressed in the form\n. Essentially, this means that investors are willing to pay\nup to six dollars for every one dollar of earnings. It can also be stated that Cameo stock is currently trading at\na multiple of six.\nThe P/E ratio is typically expressed in two primary ways. The first is as a metric listed by most finance websites\nand often carries the notation P/E (ttm). This refers to the Wall Street acronym for “trailing 12 months” and\nsignals the company’s operating performance over the past 12 months.\nAnother form of the P/E ratio is known as the forward (or leading) P/E. This uses future earnings projections\nrather than actual trailing amounts.

The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the\ndenominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.\nAnalyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when\na company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry\nthat it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as\nwhether a stock that has a ratio of\nis a good buy at its current price or if a stock with a P/E ratio of\nis\ntoo expensive, without performing any relevant comparisons or further analysis.\nAnalysts have many different ways to interpret P/E ratio data. One of the most common interpretations is that\nfirms with high P/E ratios should be growth companies. Also, a high P/E ratio could mean that a stock’s price is\nhigh relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. This could signal a possible undesired downward\nadjustment in market price in the future.\nWe can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be\nstabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to\nearnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential\ninvestment gains through stock price appreciation.\nWhile this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution\nmust always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,\nwhich would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term.

Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their\ncommon stock:\nEV/Revenue (EV/R). Also called EV/Sales, EV/R is a valuation metric used to understand a company’s total\nvaluation compared to its annual sales levels. EV/R can help provide an analyst with an idea of exactly how\nmuch investors pay for every dollar of a company’s sales revenue.\nEV/R is considered a relatively crude metric but can be useful when analyzing companies that have different\nmethods of revenue recognition. P/E ratios, for example, can be significantly affected by changes in the\naccounting policies of companies being evaluated. This is another reason why multiple metrics should be used\nin valuations.\nAdditionally, EV/R is a useful measure for companies that are consuming cash or experiencing financial losses.\nSuch companies may be start-ups or emerging technology firms that have not fully matured and are still in a\ngrowth stage of development.\nEV/EBIT.

The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward.

Many analysts like to use the\ntwo-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable\nassumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level\nof, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will\nmaintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of\ndividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.\nAs we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:\n•\nThe first period analyzed will be one of high initial growth.\n•\nThis stage of higher growth will eventually transition into a period of more mature, stable, and sustainable\ngrowth at a lower rate than the initial high-growth period.\n•\nThe dividend payout ratio will be based on company performance and the expected growth rate of its\noperations.\nLet’s use an example. Lore Ltd. estimates that its dividend growth will be 13% per year for the next five years.\nIt will then settle to a sustainable, constant, and continuing rate of 5%.

Also,\nbecause the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or\nsubjectivity. As a result of these advantages, DDMs are a very popular form of stock evaluation that most\nanalysts show faith in.\nBecause dividends are paid in cash, companies may keep making their dividend payments even when doing so\nis not in their best long-term interests. They may not want to manipulate dividend payments, as this can\ndirectly lead to stock price volatility. Rather, they may manipulate dividend payments in the interest of buoying\nup their stock price.\nTo further illustrate limitations of DDMs, let’s examine the Concepts in Practice case.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nLimitations of DDMs\nA major limitation of the dividend discount model is that it cannot be used to value companies that do not\npay dividends. This is becoming a growing trend, particularly for young high-tech companies. Warren\nBuffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has stated that companies are usually better off if they take their\nexcess funds and reinvest them into infrastructure, evolving technologies, and other profitable ventures.\nThe payment of dividends to shareholders is “almost a last resort for corporate management,”1 says\nBuffett, and cash balances should be invested in “projects to become more efficient, expand territorially,\nextend and improve product lines or . . . otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from\nits competitors.”2 Berkshire follows this practice of reinvesting cash rather than paying dividends, as do",

A single percentage\npoint change in either of these two factors can have a dramatic impact on a company’s stock, potentially\nchanging it by as much as 10 to 20%.\n1\nDan Caplinger. “Why Don’t These Winning Stocks Pay Dividends?” The Motley Fool.

The first method, calculating the\nchange in dividend each year and then averaging these changes, is the arithmetic approach.

If we assume that we will sell the stock at some point in the future,\nhowever, can we use this formula to estimate the value of a stock held for a finite period of time? The answer\nis a qualified yes. We can adjust this model for a finite horizon to estimate the present value of the dividend\nstream that we will receive while holding the stock. We will still have a problem estimating the stock’s selling\nprice at the end of this finite dividend stream, and we will address this issue shortly. For the finite growing\ndividend stream, we adjust the infinite stream in our earlier equation to the following:\nwhere n is the number of future dividends.\nThis equation may look very complicated, but just focus on the far right part of the model. This part calculates\nthe percentage of the finite dividend stream that you will receive if you sell the stock at the end of the nth year.\nSay you will sell Johnson & Johnson after 10 years.

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset.

We arrive at this amount by applying the discount rate of 8% for a one-year period to determine\nthe present value.\nIn subsequent years, Mayweather’s cash flow will be increasing by 3%. These future cash flows also must be\ndiscounted back to present values at an 8% rate, so the discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years\nwill be as follows:\nOur earlier assumption that the terminal value will be 2.5 times the value in the sixth year gives us a total\nterminal cash flow (TCF) of\n, or $3,652,697. Now, if we take all these future discounted cash\nflows and add them together, we arrive at a grand total of $13,554,477. So, based on our DCF model analysis,\nthe total value of Mayweather Inc. is just over $13.5 million.\nAt this point, we have the estimated value of the entire company, but we need to work this down to the level of\nper-share value of common stock.\nLet’s say that Mayweather is currently trading at $12 per share, and it has 1,000,000 common shares\noutstanding. This tells us that the market capitalization of the company is\n, or $12 million,\nand that a $12 share price may be considered relatively low. The reason for this is that based on our DCF\nmodel analysis, investors would theoretically be willing to pay $13,554,477 divided by 1,000,000 shares, or\n$13.55 per share, for Mayweather. The overall conclusion would be that at $12.00 per share, Mayweather\ncommon stock would be a good buy at the present time.

The only time a company would pay this par value to the\nshareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\n11.4 • Preferred Stock\n343\nFor example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future. It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant\ncash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of\nperpetuity.\nIt is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another\nform of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred\nstock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.\nDetermining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock\nWe can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the\nfollowing example. Oh-Well Heath Services Inc. has issued preferred stock that has a par value of $1,000 and\npays an annual dividend rate of 5%. If the market considers the risk of Oh-Well to warrant a 10% discount rate,\nwhat would be a fair market price for Oh-Well preferred stock?",

T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\nexplicit interest payments.

T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of\n20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8\ntrillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.\nIn 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument, Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once\nper month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the\nsecurity and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts\nmonthly in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of\nthe principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a\ntotal outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury\nborrowing we have discussed.3\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (munis). Local\nborrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,\nmunis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on\nthe perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-\nfree. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\nThere are two primary types of municipal bonds: revenue bonds and general obligation (GO) bonds.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average.

Men have\nlong dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.\nMotivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen\nrealized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary\npeople. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record.

The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation. A lower standard deviation of returns suggests less uncertainty of\nreturns and therefore less risk.\nCapital market history demonstrates that the average return to stocks has significantly outperformed other\nfinancial security classes, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or the money market.

Note that the value of the\nlarge company portfolio is more than 50 times greater than the equal investment in long-term US government\nbonds. This supports the importance of thoughtful asset allocation.\nStill, the size of a firm has a significant impact on how investors choose equity securities. Capital market\nhistory also shows that a portfolio of small company stocks has realized larger average annual returns, as well\nas greater variability, than a portfolio of large companies as represented by the S&P 500. Small-cap stock total\nreturns ranged from a high of 142.9% in 1933 to a low of -58.0% in 1937.\nMore recently, the differential return between small and large capital stocks has not been as pronounced.\nFrom 1980 through 2020, the Wilshire US Small-Cap Index has averaged an annual compound return of 12.13%\ncompared to the Wilshire US Large Cap Index average of 11.82% over the same period. The 31-basis point\npremium is much smaller than that realized in the 1926–2019 period, which saw a small-cap average annual\ncompounded return of 11.90% versus 10.14% for the large-cap portfolio.\nFigure 12.13 The Pyramid of Equity Returns: Distribution of Annual Returns for the S&P 500 Index, 1928–2020 (data source:\nAswath Damodaran Online)\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks",

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies.

When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If\nyou’re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.”\nBuffett has begun the process to give away most of his fortune, but he has left this pearl of wisdom for his\nown children: “A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do\nnothing.”\n(Sources: Joshua Kennon. “How Warren Buffett Became One of the Wealthiest People in America.” The\nBalance.

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\nStocks have produced the greatest average annual rates of return of the money and capital market assets\ndiscussed in this chapter. Stockholders bear more risk than bondholders or money market investors and\nreceive on average higher average annual returns. Despite the relatively high average annual rate of return for\nportfolios of stock, history shows that the equity markets earn negative annual returns about 25% of the time.\nThe negative returns realized by equities occur far more often than the negative results realized by money\nmarket or debt market instruments.\nKey Terms\nbond returns\nsums the periodic interest payments and the change in bond price in a given period and\ndivides by the bond price at the beginning of the period\ncommercial paper (CP)\na short-term, unsecured security issued by corporations and financial institutions to\nmeet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables\ndebenture\na common type of unsecured bond issued by a corporation\nindenture\nlegal term for a bond contract\ninflation",

In some data sets, the data values are\nconcentrated close to the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out. For example,\nan investor might examine the yearly returns for Stock A, which are 1%, 2%, -1%, 0%, and 3%, and compare\nthem to the yearly returns for Stock B, which are -9%, 2%, 15%, -5%, and 0%.\nNotice that Stock B exhibits more volatility in yearly returns than Stock A. The investor may want to quantify\nthis variation in order to make the best investment decisions for a particular investment objective.\nThe most common measure of variation, or spread, is standard deviation. The standard deviation of a data\nset is a measure of how far the data values are from their mean. A standard deviation\n•\nprovides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set; and\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n385\n•\ncan be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.\nThe standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set. The standard deviation is\nalways positive or zero. It is small when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little\nvariation or spread. It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\nvariation.",

One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,\nQ3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles\ndivide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.\n13.4 Statistical Distributions\nA frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to\norganize and tabulate the data in a summarized way. Once a frequency distribution is generated, it can be\nused to create graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set. The normal distribution has two\nparameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,\n, and the standard deviation,\n. The exponential\ndistribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.\n13.5 Probability Distributions\nA probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. In many\nfinancial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. When analyzing distributions that\nfollow a normal distribution, probabilities can be calculated by finding the area under the graph of the normal\ncurve.\n13.6 Data Visualization and Graphical Displays\nData visualization refers to the use of graphical displays to summarize a data set to help to interpret patterns\nand trends in the data. Univariate data refers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute,\nsuch as salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\nseveral types of graphs. The type of graph to be used for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the\ndata and the purpose of the graph.

For example, we may be interested\nto know if there is a correlation between bond prices and interest rates or between the age of a car and the\nvalue of the car. To investigate the correlation between two numeric quantities, the first step is to create a\nscatter plot that will graph the (x, y) ordered pairs. The independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the\nx-variable, and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as the y-variable.\nFor example, we may be interested to know if the price of Nike stock is correlated with the value of the S&P 500\n(Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index). To investigate this, monthly data can be collected for Nike stock\nprices and value of the S&P 500 for a period of time, and a scatter plot can be created and examined. A scatter\nplot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two variables. The\nsetup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted\non the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted\non the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter\ndiagram. Table 14.1 shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year\ntime period.\nTo assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine\nif a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a\nnegative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent\nvariable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to\ndecrease (the two quantities move in the same direction).

For example, this R command will generate a vector called salaries, containing the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n438\n14 • Regression Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nTo calculate the correlation coefficient r, we use the R command called cor.\nAs an example, consider the data set in Table 14.8, which tracks the return on the S&P 500 versus return on\nCoca-Cola stock for a seven-month time period.\nMonth\nS&P 500\nMonthly\nReturn (%)\nCoca-Cola\nMonthly\nReturn (%)\nJan\n8\n6\nFeb\n1\n0\nMar\n0\n-2\nApr\n2\n1\nMay\n-3\n-1\nJun\n7\n8\nJul\n4\n2\nTable 14.8 Monthly Returns of Coca-\nCola Stock versus Monthly Returns\nfor the S&P 500\nCreate two vectors in R, one vector for the S&P 500 returns and a second vector for Coca-Cola returns:\n> SP500 <- c(8,1,0,2,-3,7,4)\n> CocaCola <- c(6,0,-2,1,-1,8,2)\nThe R command called cor returns the correlation coefficient for the x-data vector and y-data vector:\n> cor(SP500, CocaCola)\nGenerate Linear Regression Models Using the R Statistical Tool\nTo create a linear model in R, assuming the correlation is significant, the command lm (for linear model) will\nprovide the slope and y-intercept for the linear regression equation.\nThe format of the R command is\nlm(dependent_variable_vector ~ independent_variable_vector)",

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year. When we are looking at the historical\ndescription of the distribution of returns and want to predict what to expect in a particular year, the arithmetic\naverage is the relevant calculation.\nMeasuring Risk\nAlthough the arithmetic average return for Delta Airlines (DAL) for 2011–2020 was 22.4%, there is not a year in\nwhich the return was exactly 22.4%. In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.\nLooking at the yearly returns in Table 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL.

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that\ninvestors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.\nIn addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,4 the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as\nthe number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration in this\nsubsequent article by Statman (https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman) for context). Increasing the size\nof the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio\nincreases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How\nmany stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all\nfinancial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification\nthan a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients.

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3.

In this section, we consider some ways to evaluate the riskiness of an investment strategy.\nA basic measure of investment performance that includes an adjustment for risk is the Sharpe ratio. The\nSharpe ratio is computed as a portfolio’s risk premium divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s\nreturn, using the formula\nThe portfolio risk premium is the portfolio return RP minus the risk-free return Rf; this is the basic reward for\nbearing risk. If the risk-free return is 3%, McKinley Investment Management’s clients who are earning 20% on\ntheir portfolios have an excess return of 17%.\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio’s return,\n, is a measure of risk. Although you see that McKinley’s\nclients earn a nice 20% return on average, you find that the returns are highly volatile. In some years, the\nclients earn much more than 20%, and in other years, the return is much lower, even negative. That volatility\nleads to a standard deviation of returns of 26%. The Sharpe ratio would be\n, or 0.65.\nThus, the Sharpe ratio can be thought of as a reward-to-risk ratio. The standard deviation in the denominator\ncan be thought of as the units of risk the investor has. The numerator is the reward the investor is receiving for\ntaking on that risk.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe. You can visit Sharpe’s Stanford\nUniversity website (https://openstax.org/r/stanford_wfsharpe) to find videos in which he discusses financial\ntopics and links to his research as well as his advice on how to invest.\nTreynor Measurement of Performance\nAnother reward-to-risk ratio measurement of investment performance is the Treynor ratio. The Treynor ratio\nis calculated as\nJust as with the Sharpe ratio, the numerator of the Treynor ratio is a portfolio’s risk premium; the difference is\nthat the Treynor ratio focus focuses on systematic risk, using the beta of the portfolio in the denominator,\nwhile the Shape ratio focuses on total risk, using the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns in the\n15.4 • Applications in Performance Measurement\n465\ndenominator.\nIf McKinley Investment Management has a portfolio with a 20% return over the past five years, with a beta of\n1.2 and a risk-free rate of 3%, the Treynor ratio would be\nBoth the Sharpe and Treynor ratios are relative measures of investment performance, meaning that there is\nnot an absolute number that indicates whether an investment performance is good or bad.

An investment\nmanager’s performance must be considered in relation to that of other managers or to a benchmark index.\nJensen’s Alpha\nJensen’s alpha is another common measure of investment performance. It is computed as the raw portfolio\nreturn minus the expected portfolio return predicted by the CAPM:\nSuppose that the average market return has been 12%. What would Jensen’s alpha be for McKinley Investment\nManagement’s portfolio with a 20% average return and a beta of 1.2?\nUnlike the Sharpe and Treynor ratios, which are meaningful in a relative sense, Jensen’s alpha is meaningful in\nan absolute sense. An alpha of 0.062 indicates that the McKinley Investment Management portfolio provided a\nreturn that was 6.2% higher than would be expected given the riskiness of the portfolio. A positive alpha\nindicates that the portfolio had an abnormal return. If Jensen’s alpha equals zero, the portfolio return was\nexactly what was expected given the riskiness of the portfolio as measured by beta.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nComparing the Returns and Risks of Portfolios\nYou are interviewing two investment managers.

Unlike the average return, this standard deviation is not equal to the average of\nthe standard deviations of returns of the four stocks. In fact, the standard deviation for the portfolio is less\nthan the standard deviation for any one of the four stocks. Remember that this occurs because the stock\nreturns are not perfectly positively correlated. The high return of one of the stocks in one month is dampened\nby a lower return in another stock during the same month.

This website on calculating the NPV on an MBA degree\n(https://openstax.org/r/calculating-the-NPV) lets you apply this concept in an educational setting. The\ninitial cost of the MBA includes both the dollars spent on tuition and the wages that a full-time student\ncould have earned if they were not in school. Why is it appropriate to include these forgone wages in the\ncalculation? What adjustments would students need to make to this analysis if they wanted to consider\nattending a part-time MBA program that allowed them to continue working while completing the program?\nNPV Profile\nThe NPV of a project depends on the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to\ntranslate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the\nembroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash\nflows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.\nTheoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In\nreality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an\napproximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall\nconclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and\nallows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.\nTo construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery\nmachine project using each of those discount rates. Table 16.6 below shows the NPV for several discount rates.\nNotice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate",

Later\nin this chapter, we will look at how to use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.\nNo Single Mathematical Solution. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method is that there may not be a\nsingle mathematical solution to an IRR problem. This can happen when negative cash flows occur in more than\none period in the project. Suppose your company is considering building a facility for an upcoming Olympic\ncompetition. The construction cost would be $350 million. The facility would be used for one year and generate\ncash inflows of $950 million. Then, the following year, your company would be required to convert the facility\ninto a public park area for the city, which is expected to cost $620 million. Placing these cash flows in a timeline\nresults in the following (Table 16.8):\n16.3 • Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\n487\nYear\n0\n1\n2\nCash Flow ($Millions) (350) 950 (620)\nTable 16.8\nThe NPV profile for this project looks like Figure 16.3.

The IRR assumes that the cash flows are reinvested at the internal rate of\nreturn when they are received. This is a disadvantage of the IRR method. The firm may not be able to find any\nother projects with returns equal to a high-IRR project, so the company may not be able to reinvest at the IRR.\nThe reinvestment rate assumption becomes problematic when a company has several acceptable projects and\nis attempting to rank the projects. We will look more closely at the issues that can arise when considering\nmutually exclusive projects later in this chapter. If a company is simply deciding whether to accept a single\nproject, the reinvestment assumption limitation is not relevant.\nOverlooking Differences in Scale. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method to choose among various\nacceptable projects is that it ignores differences in scale. The IRR converts the cash flows to percentages and\nignores differences in the size or scale of projects. Issues that occur when comparing projects of different\nscales are covered later in this chapter.\n16.4\nAlternative Methods\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate profitability index.\n•\nCalculate discounted payback period.\n•\nCalculate modified internal rate of return.\nProfitability Index (PI)\nThe profitability index (PI) uses the same inputs as the NPV calculation, but it converts the results to a ratio.\nThe numerator is the present value of the benefits of doing a project.

When NPV is greater than zero, PI will be greater than 1. When\nNPV is less than zero, PI will be less than 1. Therefore, the decision criterion using the PI method is to accept a\nproject if the PI is greater than 1 and reject a project if the PI is less than 1.\nNote that the NPV method and the PI method of project evaluation will always provide the same answer to the",

The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from\nbest to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.\nDiscounted Payback Period\nThe payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the\nfact that it ignores the time value of money. The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\ndetermine the payback period.\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback\nperiod does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00)\n2,000.00\n4,000.00\n5,000.00\n5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\nDiscounted Cash Flow ($)\n(16,000)\n1,834.86\n3,366.72\n3,860.92\n3,542.13 3,249.66 2,981.34\nCumulative Discounted\nCash Flow ($)\n(16,000.00) (14,165.14) (10,798.42) (6,937.50) (3,395.37) (145.72) 2,835.62\nTable 16.9\nWhen the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.\nThe discounted payback period would be\nyears. This adjusted calculation addresses the\npayback period method’s flaw of not considering the time value of money, but managers are still confronted\nwith the other disadvantages. No objective criterion for acceptance or rejection exists because of the lack of a\ntheoretical underpinning for what is an acceptable payback period length. The discounted payback period\nignores any cash flows after breakeven occurs; this is a serious drawback, especially when comparing mutually\nexclusive projects.\nModified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)\nFinancial analysts have developed an alternative evaluation technique that is similar to the IRR but modified in",

However, another, more expensive embroidery\nmachine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-\nduty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more\nrevenue. The two embroidery machines are mutually exclusive projects. Mutually exclusive projects compete\nwith one another; purchasing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery\nmachine.\nTable 16.11 shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as\nwell as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but it will generate more cash inflows\nin years 3 through 6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to decisions to accept the projects. Also, both\nmachines have an IRR exceeding the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to decisions to accept\nthe projects.\nWhen considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the\nmanagers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to\ntake the project with the highest NPV.

This truck is smaller and will not be able to hold as many\nfrozen treats. However, the truck is newer, with lower mileage, and you estimate that you can use it for six\nyears. This newer truck will allow you to generate a cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The\nNPV of the newer truck is $80,658.\nBecause both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which\ntruck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its\nhigher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made\nsimply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV\nthan the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.\nThere are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life\nproject concludes, another, similar project will be available.\nReplacement Chain Approach\nWith the replacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal\nthe life of the long-life project. You can purchase the newer, lower-mileage ice-cream truck and run your\nbusiness for six years. To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last\nfor three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for\nthe next three years. In essence, you are comparing a six-year project with two consecutive three-year projects\nso that both options will generate cash inflows for six years.

It is important to note that this is not always a\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated.

The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\nestimate of what it expects.\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\nby the end of April.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReducing Capital Spending\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this chapter, we look at the basic principles that\nmanagers use to minimize the cost of funding and maximize the value of the firm.\nHow Firms Raise Capital\n17\n17 • Why It Matters\n507\n17.1\nThe Concept of Capital Structure\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between the two major sources of capital appearing on a balance sheet.\n•\nExplain why there is a cost of capital.\n•\nCalculate the weights in a company’s capital structure.\nThe Basic Balance Sheet\nIn order to produce and sell its products or services, a company needs assets. If a firm will produce shirts, for\nexample, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to\nstore its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These\nitems the company needs to conduct its operations are assets. They appear on the left-hand side of the\nbalance sheet.\nThe company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets\nappear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent its capital.\nThere are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).\nFigure 17.2 is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet\nmust be\n. Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling\nownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders). The debt that a firm uses is\noften referred to as financial leverage. The relative proportions of debt and equity that a firm uses in\nfinancing its assets is referred to as its capital structure.\nFigure 17.2 Basic Balance Sheet for Company with Debt, Preferred Stock, and Common Equity in Capital Structure\nAttracting Capital\nWhen a company raises money from investors, those investors forgo the opportunity to invest that money\nelsewhere.

In economics terms, there is an opportunity cost to those who buy a company’s bonds or stock.\nSuppose, for example, that you have $5,000, and you purchase Tesla stock. You could have purchased Apple\nstock or Disney stock instead. There were many other options, but once you chose Tesla stock, you no longer\nhad the money available for the other options. You would only purchase Tesla stock if you thought that you\nwould receive a return as large as you would have for the same level of risk on the other investments.\nFrom Tesla’s perspective, this means that the company can only attract your capital if it offers an expected\nreturn high enough for you to choose it as the company that will use your money. Providing a return equal to\nwhat potential investors could expect to earn elsewhere for a similar risk is the cost a company bears in\nexchange for obtaining funds from investors. Just as a firm must consider the costs of electricity, raw\nmaterials, and wages when it calculates the costs of doing business, it must also consider the cost of attracting\ncapital so that it can purchase its assets.\nWeights in the Capital Structure\nMost companies have multiple sources of capital. The firm’s overall cost of capital is a weighted average of its\n508\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndebt and equity costs of capital. The average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted by the\nfractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity, is known as the weighted average cost of\ncapital (WACC).\nThe weights in the WACC are the proportions of debt and equity used in the firm’s capital structure. If, for\nexample, a company is financed 25% by debt and 75% by equity, the weights in the WACC would be 25% on the\ndebt cost of capital and 75% on the equity cost of capital. The balance sheet of the company would look like\nFigure 17.3.\nThese weights can be derived from the right-hand side of a market-value-based balance sheet. Recall that\naccounting-based book values listed on traditional financial statements reflect historical costs. The market-\nvalue balance sheet is similar to the accounting balance sheet, but all values are current market values.\nFigure 17.3 Balance Sheet of Company with Capital Structure of 25% Debt and 75% Equity\nJust as the accounting balance sheet must balance, the market-value balance sheet must balance:",

The cost of common stock capital cannot be directly observed in the market; it must be estimated. Two\nprimary methods for estimating the cost of common stock capital are the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)\nand the constant dividend growth model.\nCAPM\nThe CAPM is based on using the firm’s systematic risk to estimate the expected returns that shareholders\nrequire to invest in the stock. According to the CAPM, the cost of equity (re) can be estimated using the\nformula\nFor example, suppose that Bluebonnet Industries has an equity beta of 1.3.

Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be",

In April 2021, for example, the beta for IBM was reported as 0.97 by MarketWatch and as 1.25 by\nYahoo!

The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered.

This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.",

The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target.

Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target.

Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income.

Figure 18.13 shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods using all of this data.\nFigure 18.13 Forecasted Income Statement\nForecast the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales. Thus, Clear Lake estimates its",

Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable.

While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable.

In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase",

Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential\nchanges they are considering. They may reduce the new salaries package by a percentage point to see if it\ngets them closer to their goal. They may adjust cost of goods sold by a certain percentage if they feel they can\nnegotiate with vendors to work down their costs. They may adjust rent and see if they can find a better retail\nlocation to either reduce costs or increase sales due to increased foot traffic in a new location. They may save\nan entirely new version of the forecast and change it drastically to see what investing in opening a second\nretail location would do.\nAs you can see, the list of possibilities is endless. Though the main goal of financial managers may be cash\nplanning, the power of a well-developed forecast is tremendous. It can help assess potential growth, new\nopportunities, and even small changes in the business as well.\nSensitivity Analysis in Forecasting\nSensitivity analysis will often look at the change in just one variable rather than the entire scenario. It\nexamines how sensitive a particular output (commonly net income) will be to a change in a particular\nunderlying input (sales or costs, for example). What if sales are 10% more or less than forecasted? What if the\nprices the firm can charge its customers are 10% more or less? What if the cost of goods sold increases by\n10%? The purpose is to see which variables are crucial to “get right.” It isn’t worth spending a lot of research\ndollars to make sure you are accurately predicting a variable if that variable won’t notably change the\noutcome.

We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key\nformulas in Excel.\n1.\nFirst, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is\ncalculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. In Figure 18.19, you\ncan see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase\nthe prior year’s sales by 18%.\n2.\nNext, the sales are distributed by month. In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula",

To begin the year, in Figure 18.22, we see that the formula\nin B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three\nmonths prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected\nfrom customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.\nUtilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be\nthe utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement. Note that interest payments are\nassumed to be zero in January and February, but in March, the formula in D14 sums the interest expenses on\nthe forecasted income statement for January, February, and March.

Excess cash is invested in cash alternatives such as\nmarketable securities, creating liquidity that can be tapped when operating cash flow needs exceed the\namount of cash on hand (checking account balances). Investment in inventory is necessary to meet the\ndemand for products (sales), and if the firm extends credit to its customers so that a sale can be made, the\nbalance sheet will also show accounts receivable—a very common current asset that derives its value from the\nprobability that customers will pay their bills.\nWorking capital is often spoken about in two versions: gross working capital and net working capital. As was\npreviously stated, gross working capital is equivalent to current assets, particularly those that are cash, cash-\nlike, or will be converted to cash within a short period of time (i.e., in less than one year).\nNet working capital (NWC) is a more refined concept of working capital.

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.",

Financial managers monitor and analyze each component\nof the cash conversion cycle. Ideally, a company’s management should minimize the number of days it takes\nto convert inventory to cash while maximizing the amount of time it takes to pay suppliers.\nQuickly converting inventory to sales speeds up cash inflows and shortens the cash cycle, but it also could help\nreduce inventory losses as a result of obsolescence. Inventory becomes obsolete because of a variety of\nfactors including time—inventory that has not been sold for a long period of time and is not expected to be\nsold in the future has to be written down or written off according to accounting rules. Write-offs of inventory\ncan result in significant losses for a company. In the food business, inventory conversion periods take on great\nimportance because of spoilage of perishable goods; in retailing, seasonal items lose value the longer they\nstay on the shelves.\nVarious inventory management techniques are used to shorten production time in manufacturing, and in\nretailing, strategies are used to reduce the amount of time a product sits on the shelf or is stored in the\nwarehouse. Production techniques such as just-in-time inventory systems and marketing and pricing\nstrategies can have an impact on the number of days in the inventory conversion cycle.\nFor the receivables collection period, a relatively long receivables collection period means that the company is\nhaving trouble collecting cash from its customers and so whatever can be done to speed up collections while\nstill offering competitive credit terms should be pursued by financial managers. For example, companies that\nconverted paper invoicing to e-invoicing most likely reduce the average collection period by some number of\ndays, as it makes sense that if a bill is transmitted electronically, lag time is cut (no delays because of “snail\nmail”) and collections (payments back to the company from customers) may happen sooner.

With a credit card, a consumer opens an account with a credit limit. Most trade credit is\noffered to a company with an open account that has a credit limit up to which the company can purchase\ngoods or services without having to pay the cash up front. As long as the payments are made in accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement (also called credit terms), no interest or additional fees are charged on the\ncredit balance except possibly for a fee for late payment.\nInitially, the vendor’s credit department approves both a trade credit limit and credit payment terms (i.e.,\nnumber of days after the invoice date that payment is due). Timely payments on accounts payable (trade\ncredit) helps create a credit history for the purchasing firm.\nTrade Credit Terms\nTrade credit arrangements often carry credit terms that offer an incentive, called a discount, for a company\n(the buyer) to pay its bill within a relatively short period of time. Net terms, also referred to as the full credit\nperiod, are the number of days that a business (purchaser) has before they must pay their invoice. A common\nnet term is Net 30, with payment due in full within 30 days of the invoice.\nMany vendors also offer cash discounts to customers that pay their bill early. A company’s invoice that\nspecifies payment terms of “2/10 n/30” (stated as: “two ten net 30”) would allow a 2 percent discount if the\nbuyer’s account balance is paid within 10 days of the invoice date; otherwise, the net amount owed would be\ndue in 30 days. The “10 days” in the example is the discount period—the number of days the buyer has to\ntake advantage of the cash discount for an early payment, also known as quick payment.\nFor example, Jackson’s Premium Jams Inc. received a $10,500 invoice for the purchase of jelly jars. The invoice\nhas payment terms of 2/10 n/30. Jackson’s pays the bill within 10 days of the invoice date. Jackson’s payment\nwould be\n.

In Cost of Trade Credit, there is an example that shows the high annualize opportunity cost (36.73\npercent) of not taking advantage of cash discounts.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nTrade Credit of International Trade\nWhen international trade occurs, two important documents are commonly required: a letter of credit and\na bill of lading. A letter of credit is issued by a financial institution on behalf of the foreign buyer\n(importer). The bill of lading is a legal document that gives proof of a contract between a transportation\ncompany and the buyer and is one important piece of documentation that allows the buyer to draw on the\nletter of credit. A bill of lading serves as a document of title and proof of receipt of goods by the shipper.\nThe letter of credit secures a promise of payment to the seller (exporter) provided that the terms of the sale\nare met. For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a\nliability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.\nCost of Trade Credit\nTrade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,\nbank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade\ncredit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts\npayable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long\n576\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nas payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.\nHowever, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of\ncash discounts when offered by sellers.

The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73\npercent.\n19.3\nCash Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why firms hold cash.\n•\nList instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.\nCash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows. To manage\ncash, the cash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected",

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments. Cash alternative investments are not committed to the\nstock market.\nSecurity\nDescription\nUS Treasury bills",

If a company has a prior relationship with a customer seeking trade credit, the\ncustomer’s payment history with the firm is also carefully evaluated before additional credit is granted.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCorporate Finance Institute\nCredit managers use various tools and techniques to evaluate creditworthiness of customers. The\nCorporate Finance Institute’s website states that “the ‘5 Cs of Credit’ is a common phrase used to describe\nthe five major factors [character, capacity, collateral, capital, and conditions] used to determine a potential\nborrower’s creditworthiness.” It goes on to say that “a credit report provides a comprehensive account of\nthe borrower’s total debt, current balances, credit limits, and history of defaults and bankruptcies, if any.”5\nMore on the 5 Cs of credit can be found on the Corporate Finance Institute’s website (https://openstax.org/\nr/corporate-finance).\nDetermining the Credit Policy\nA company’s credit policy encompasses rules of credit granting and procedures for the collections of accounts.\nIt’s how a company will process credit applications, utilize credit scoring and credit bureaus, analyze financial\nstatements, make credit limit decisions, and conduct collection efforts when accounts become delinquent (still\noutstanding after their due date).\nEstablishing Credit Terms\nTrade credit terms were discussed earlier. Recall that part of the terms and conditions of a sale are the credit\nterms—elements of a sales agreement (contract) that indicate when payment is due, possible discounts (for\nquick payments), and any late fee charges.\nIf open credit is for a sales transaction, an agreement is made as to the length of time for which credit is to be\ngranted (payment period) and a discount for early payment.

The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000.

Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender).

The budgeting process of a company is a really an integrated process—it links a\nseries of budgets together so that company objectives can be achieved.

For a service firm, a purchase budget for inventory would not be\nnecessary, but an operating budget would be. All businesses need a cash budget, which is the topic of the next\nsection of this chapter.\nThe example operating budget presented here is of a merchandising company. Budgets are prepared\nfollowing a process that begins with a sales (or revenue) forecast. The sales forecast is normally based on\ninformation obtained from both internal and external sources and predicts the amount of units to be sold in\nthe planning period—usually one year into the future.\nA company’s management, in consultation with its marketing and sales executives, would prepare a sales\nbudget by making assumptions about the number of units that are expected to be sold and the prices that will\nbe charged. From the sales budget, projections are made as to cash receipts each month, and therefore\nassumptions have to be made as to how much of each month’s sales will be cash sales and how much cash will\nflow into the company from the collection credit sales (including cash flow in from the prior month’s sales).\nFigure 19.7 provides an example of a sales budget and projected accounts receivable collections and cash\nsales for the months of January through December. Keep in mind that projected monthly sales amounts are\nnot equal to cash collected from sales. Because of sales on credit, some cash from sales lags credit sales as\ncollections can extend beyond the month of sale. Credit terms such terms such as net 30 (net amount owed to\nbe paid in 30 days) have to be considered when developing a forecasted cash collection pattern.\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n585\nFigure 19.7 Example of a Sales and Collections Budget\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file1) containing key Chapter 19\nExcel exhibits.",

If sales are expected to increase, purchases of\ninventory and some operating expenses would also increase. To meet the demand for goods and services (as\ndefined in the sales budget), a purchases (inventory) budget would be prepared. In this example (Figure 19.8),\nthe purchases budget shows projected purchases of inventory (merchandise) and the projected payments\n(also called disbursements) for each month.\nCash outflows as a result of purchases often do not equal the projected purchase amount. That is because\npayments for purchases are usually on credit (accounts payable), and so purchases for one month typically get\nspread out over a period of time that encompasses the current month and the month (or months) thereafter.\nTo keep this example simple, the assumption is that the purchases are paid for in the following month (an\naverage days payable outstanding of 30 days). However, in other cases, payment patterns may be based on\nother payment periods such as 45, 60, or even 90 days, depending on the trade credit terms.\nFigure 19.8 Purchases Budget\nAn operating expense budget is prepared next and is basically a prediction of the selling and administrative\nexpenditures of the company. Notice in Figure 19.9 that in the operating expense budget, cost of goods sold\n(an expense) is not included, nor are noncash expenses such as depreciation. The cash outlays related to\ngoods sold, at least in a merchandising operation, are accounted for in the purchases budget (payments for\npurchases of inventory.)\nWith the sales, purchases, and operating expense budgets prepared, the cash budget can be prepared. Some\nof the “inputs” to the cash budget are from the sales (collections of cash), purchases (payments), and the\noperating expense budget (cash expenditures for selling and administrative expenses).

The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables.

The three major areas of focus for the financial manager are the size, the timing, and the riskiness\nof the cash flows of the company. Broadly, the financial manager should work to\n•\nincrease cash coming into the company and decrease cash going out of the company;\n•\nspeed up cash coming into the company and slow down cash going out of the company; and\n•\ndecrease the riskiness of both money coming in and money going out of the company.\nThe first item in this list is obvious. The more revenue a company has, the more profitable it will be.\nBusinesspeople talk about “top line” growth when discussing this objective because revenue appears at the\ntop of the company’s income statement. Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book",

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of\noperating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStarbucks\nThe most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on\nthe company’s investor relations website under the Financial Data section (https://openstax.org/r/\nFinancial_Data_section).

Because you receive more reals for each dollar in 2021 than you would have a year earlier, the dollar\nis said to have appreciated relative to the Brazilian real. Likewise, because it takes more Brazilian reals to\npurchase $1.00, the real is said to have depreciated relative to the US dollar.\nExchange Rate Risks\nStarbucks, like other firms that are engaged in international business, faces currency exchange rate risk.\nChanges in exchange rates can impact a business in several ways. These risks are often classified as\ntransaction, translation, or economic risk.\nTransaction Risk\nTransaction risk is the risk that the value of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result\nof a change in currency exchange rates. If Starbucks agrees to pay a Brazilian coffee grower seven million\nBrazilian reals for an order of one million pounds of coffee beans, Starbucks will need to purchase Brazilian\nreals to pay the bill.

If, however, Starbucks agreed in March to purchase the coffee beans several months later, in July,\nStarbucks would not have known then what the exchange rate would be when it came time to complete the\ntransaction. Although Starbucks would have locked in a price of BRL 7,000,000 for one million pounds of coffee\nbeans, it would not have known what the coffee beans would cost the company in terms of US dollars.\nIf the US dollar appreciated so that it cost less to purchase each Brazilian real in July, Starbucks would find that\nit was paying less than $1,287,300 for the coffee beans. For example, suppose the dollar appreciated so that\nthe exchange rate was\nin July 2021. Then the coffee beans would only cost Starbucks\n.\nOn the other hand, if the US dollar depreciated and it cost more to purchase each Brazilian real, then\nStarbucks would find that its dollar cost for the coffee beans was higher than it expected.

Southwest Airlines has been known as the most\naggressive airline when it comes to hedging the risk of jet fuel cost volatility. In this interview, the CEO of\nSouthwest Airlines, Gary Kelly, discusses crude oil prices in the spring of 2012 and the impact on Southwest\nAirlines.\n1. How volatile are oil prices, and how large of an impact does that volatility have on the cost structure of an\nairline?\n2. Gary Kelly states that he sees fuel prices as the largest single business risk Southwest Airlines faces and\nthat hedging that risk has become more expensive. Why do you think it became more expensive for\nSouthwest Airlines to hedge this risk in 2012?\nBMW in the United States\nClick to view content (https://openstax.org/r/BMW_US_Natural_Hedging)\nWhile the name BMW may sound German, a significant amount of BMW’s production occurs outside of\nGermany.

Why, if he is paying for the car in US dollars, do you think that he is impacted by the currency\nexchange rate?\n4.
