            "chunk": "there are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory. Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances.

If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases. How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A holding is the \ncourt’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the \nmeaning of the case as a precedent for future cases. \n \nBeyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to \nunderstand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought) \neach trial or appellate judge believes in. Because judges do not always agree on first principles (i.e., they",

(This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who",

This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni. Etzioni was a founder of the \nCommunitarian Network, which is a group of individuals who have come together to bolster the moral, \nsocial, and political environment. It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope. \n \nThe relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: \n \n1. If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do. \n \nThe importance of an individual’s having these consistent qualities of character is well known. Often we \nremember the last bad thing a person did far more than any or all previous good acts. For example, Eliot \nSpitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good \nthey accomplished as public servants. As for a company, its good reputation also has an incalculable value \nthat when lost takes a great deal of time and work to recover. Shell, Nike, and other companies have \ndiscovered that there is a market for morality, however difficult to measure, and that not paying attention \nto business ethics often comes at a serious price. In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and \ncompliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal proceedings against companies but also \nbecause major companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered retroactively but must be \npursued proactively. For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue \nbecomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the same lesson. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThroughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers \nhave come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social \ncontract theory; and virtue ethics. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nXYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles. Customers \nhave had near-death experiences from sudden acceleration; they would be driving along a highway at normal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n60 \nspeed when suddenly the car would begin to accelerate, and efforts to stop the acceleration by braking fail to \nwork. Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to \ndo so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration. \nInternal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are \nnot being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal. In fact, there appears to be a \npossible flaw in both models, perhaps in a semiconductor chip, that makes sudden acceleration happen. \nInterference by floor mats and poorly designed gas pedals do not seem to be the problem. \nIt is voluntary to report these incidents to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), \nbut the company decides that it will wait awhile and see if there are more complaints. Recalling the two \nmodels so that local dealers and their mechanics could examine them is also an option, but it would be \nextremely costly. Company executives are aware that quarterly and annual profit-and-loss statements, on \nwhich their bonuses depend, could be decisively worse with a recall. They decide that on a cost-benefit basis, \nit makes more sense to wait until there are more accidents and more data. After a hundred or more accidents \nand nearly fifteen fatalities, the company institutes a selective recall, still not notifying NHTSA, which has its \nown experts and the authority to order XYZ to do a full recall of all affected models. \nExperts have advised XYZ that standard failure-analysis methodology requires that the company obtain \nabsolutely every XYZ vehicle that has experienced sudden acceleration, using microscopic analysis of all critical \ncomponents of the electronic system. The company does not wish to take that advice, as it would be—as one \ntop executive put it—“too time-consuming and expensive.” \n1. Can XYZ’s approach to this problem be justified under utilitarian theory? If so, how? If not, why not? \n2. What would Kant advise XYZ to do? Explain. \n3.

But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be \naffected by corporate decisions. \n \nAccording to stakeholder theorists, corporations (and other business organizations) must pay attention \nnot only to the bottom line but also to their overall effect on the community. Public perception of a \ncompany’s unfairness, uncaring, disrespect, or lack of trustworthiness often leads to long-term failure, \nwhatever the short-term successes or profits may be.

Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and",

[4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and \nmodeled by the top of the organization. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n72 \n \nIt’s often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as top management is willing to make it. If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n73 \nIf you manage by the numbers, there is a temptation to lie about those numbers, based on the need to get \nstock price ever higher. At Enron, “15 percent a year or better earnings growth” was the mantra. Jeffrey \nPfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University, observes how the belief that “stock \nprice is all that matters” has been hardwired into the corporate psyche. It dictates not only how people \njudge the worth of their company but also how they feel about themselves and the work that they are \ndoing. And, over time, it has clouded judgments about what is acceptable corporate behavior. [6] \n \nManaging by Numbers: The Sears Auto Center Story \nIf winning is the most important thing in your life, then you must be prepared to do anything to \nwin. \n—Michael Josephson \n \nMost people want to be winners or associate with winners. As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers. But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs. The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year",

New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n• \nThe long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to \nmeasure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially. \n• \nSears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant \ninformation about the service being offered. This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier. Sears, like other \nsellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would \nnot permit such information distortions. \n• \nPeople in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary. \n \nNoting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had \nlost sight of other goals for the organization. \n \nThe emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical. The \ntemptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write \nthe history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done. In a way, this \nfits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. \n \nConscious Capitalism \nOne effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious \ncapitalism movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7]",

The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts.

A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels.

In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue? Time—and \nthe Supreme Court—will tell. \n \nClass Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n122 \nMost lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other \norganization. But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave. If she does, she will not be \nincluded in an eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n123 \ncannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the \noutcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAnyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has \nstanding will be heard by the courts. Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to \nensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries. Class actions are \na way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1.

Understand the various ways that lawyers charge for services. \n2. Describe the contingent fee system in the United States. \n3. Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n \nLegal Fees \nLawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. \nA flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance \napproximately how long it will take her to do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are \nexamples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the \nworth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price. \n \nLawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial \nmatters. Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range \nfrom $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time. \n \nA contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the \nsuccess of the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., \nautomobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite often, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n125 \ncontingent fee is controversial. Trial lawyers justify it by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such \nlawsuits. A typical automobile accident case can cost at least ten thousand dollars to prepare, and a \ncomplicated products-liability case can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Few people have that kind of \nmoney or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit. Corporate and \nprofessional defendants complain that the contingent fee gives lawyers a license to go big game hunting, \nor to file suits against those with deep pockets in the hopes of forcing them to settle. \n \nTrial lawyers respond that the contingent fee arrangement forces them to screen cases and weed out cases \nthat are weak, because it is not worth their time to spend the hundreds of hours necessary on such cases if \ntheir chances of winning are slim or nonexistent. \n \nCosts \nIn England and in many other countries, the losing party must pay the legal expenses of the winning \nparty, including attorneys’ fees. That is not the general rule in this country. Here, each party must pay \nmost of its own costs, including (and especially) the fees of lawyers. (Certain relatively minor costs, such \nas filing fees for various documents required in court, are chargeable to the losing side, if the judge \ndecides it.) This type of fee structure is known as the American rule (in contrast to the British rule). \n \nThere are two types of exceptions to the American rule. By statute, Congress and the state legislatures \nhave provided that the winning party in particular classes of cases may recover its full legal costs from the \nloser—for example, the federal antitrust laws so provide and so does the federal Equal Access to Justice \nAct. The other exception applies to litigants who either initiate lawsuits in bad faith, with no expectation \nof winning, or who defend them in bad faith, in order to cause the plaintiff great expense. Under these \ncircumstances, a court has the discretion to award attorneys’ fees to the winner. But this rule is not \ninfinitely flexible, and courts do not have complete freedom to award attorneys’ fees in any amount, but",

Rudzewicz \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz \n471 U.S. 462 (U.S. Supreme Court 1985) \n \nSummary \nBurger King Corp. is a Florida corporation with principal offices in Miami. It principally conducts \nrestaurant business through franchisees. The franchisees are licensed to use Burger King’s trademarks \nand service marks in standardized restaurant facilities. Rudzewicz is a Michigan resident who, with a \npartner (MacShara) operated a Burger King franchise in Drayton Plains, Michigan. Negotiations for \nsetting up the franchise occurred in 1978 largely between Rudzewicz, his partner, and a regional office of \nBurger King in Birmingham, Michigan, although some deals and concessions were made by Burger King \nin Florida. A preliminary agreement was signed in February of 1979. Rudzewicz and MacShara assumed \noperation of an existing facility in Drayton Plains and MacShara attended prescribed management \ncourses in Miami during the four months following Feb. 1979. \n \nRudzewicz and MacShara bought $165,000 worth of restaurant equipment from Burger King’s Davmor \nIndustries division in Miami. But before the final agreements were signed, the parties began to disagree \nover site-development fees, building design, computation of monthly rent, and whether Rudzewicz and \nMacShara could assign their liabilities to a corporation they had formed. Negotiations took place between \nRudzewicz, MacShara, and the Birmingham regional office; but Rudzewicz and MacShara learned that the \nregional office had limited decision-making power and turned directly to Miami headquarters for their \nconcerns. The final agreement was signed by June 1979 and provided that the franchise relationship was \ngoverned by Florida law, and called for payment of all required fees and forwarding of all relevant notices \nto Miami headquarters. \n \nThe Drayton Plains restaurant did fairly well at first, but a recession in late 1979 caused the franchisees to \nfall far behind in their monthly payments to Miami. Notice of default was sent from Miami to Rudzewicz, \nwho nevertheless continued to operate the restaurant as a Burger King franchise. Burger King sued in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n131 \nfederal district court for the southern district of Florida. Rudzewicz contested the court’s personal \njurisdiction over him, since he had never been to Florida. \n \nThe federal court looked to Florida’s long arm statute and held that it did have personal jurisdiction over \nthe non-resident franchisees, and awarded Burger King a quarter of a million dollars in contract damages \nand enjoined the franchisees from further operation of the Drayton Plains facility. Franchisees appealed \nto the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and won a reversal based on lack of personal jurisdiction. Burger King \npetitioned the Supreme Ct. for a writ of certiorari. \n \nJustice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court. \n \nThe Due Process Clause protects an individual’s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding \njudgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful “contacts, ties, or relations.” \nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington. By requiring that individuals have “fair warning that a particular \nactivity may subject [them] to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,” the Due Process Clause “gives a \ndegree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary \nconduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to \nsuit.”… \n \nWhere a forum seeks to assert specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has not consented \nto suit there, this “fair warning” requirement is satisfied if the defendant has “purposefully directed” his \nactivities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that “arise out of or \nrelate to” those activities, Thus “[t]he forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process \nClause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of \ncommerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State” and those \nproducts subsequently injure forum consumers. Similarly, a publisher who distributes magazines in a \ndistant State may fairly be held accountable in that forum for damages resulting there from an allegedly \ndefamatory story.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org",

The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware). The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so \nthe federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate seats for every state, no matter how small. \nThe Senate was also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial nominations. The net effect \nof this today is that senators from a very small number of states can block treaties and other important \nlegislation. The power of small states is also magnified by the Senate’s cloture rule, which currently \nrequires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. \n \nBecause the Constitution often speaks in general terms (with broad phrases such as “due process” and \n“equal protection”), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those terms apply in specific cases. The \nUnited States is unique among industrialized democracies in having a Supreme Court that reserves for \nitself that exclusive power to interpret what the Constitution means. The famous case of Marbury v. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n143 \nMadison began that tradition in 1803, when the Supreme Court had marginal importance in the new \nrepublic. The decision in Bush v. Gore, decided in December of 2000, illustrates the power of the court to \nshape our destiny as a nation. In that case, the court overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court \nregarding the way to proceed on a recount of the Florida vote for the presidency. The court’s ruling was \npurportedly based on the “equal protection of the laws” provision in the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nFrom Marbury to the present day, the Supreme Court has articulated the view that the US Constitution \nsets the framework for all other US laws, whether statutory or judicially created. Thus any statute (or \nportion thereof) or legal ruling (judicial or administrative) in conflict with the Constitution is not \nenforceable. And as the Bush v. Gore decision indicates, the states are not entirely free to do what they \nmight choose; their own sovereignty is limited by their union with the other states in a federal sovereign. \n \nIf the Supreme Court makes a “bad decision” as to what the Constitution means, it is not easily \noverturned. Either the court must change its mind (which it seldom does) or two-thirds of Congress and \nthree-fourths of the states must make an amendment (Article V). \n \nBecause the Supreme Court has this power of judicial review, there have been many arguments about how \nit should be exercised and what kind of “philosophy” a Supreme Court justice should have. President \nRichard Nixon often said that a Supreme Court justice should “strictly construe” the Constitution and not \nadd to its language. Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” \nThe general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in \naccord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their \nown views and values. Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the \nConstitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics \nof the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as",

It is short, but most federal legislation affecting business depends on \nthis very clause: \n \nSection 8 \n[Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; \nbut all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; \n[Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \n \n[Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes; \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n147 \n[Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of \nBankruptcies throughout the United States; \n \n[Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of \nWeights and Measures; \n \nEarly Commerce Clause Cases \nFor many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying the commerce clause: Congress could only \nuse it to legislate aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another. Anything else was deemed \nlocal rather than national. For example, In Hammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916 federal statute \nhad barred transportation in interstate commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing \nchildren under fourteen or employing children fourteen and above for more than eight hours a day. A \ncomplaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his \nown behalf and on behalf of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other \nbetween fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nThe father’s lawsuit asked the court to enjoin (block) the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to \nprevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor. \n \nThe Supreme Court saw the issue as whether Congress had the power under the commerce clause to \ncontrol interstate shipment of goods made by children under the age of fourteen. The court found that \nCongress did not. The court cited several cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be \nconstitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of",

Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties. The first category \nincludes most of the liberties expressly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Through a process known as \nselective incorporation, the court has interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nbar states from denying their residents the most important freedoms guaranteed in the first ten \namendments to the federal Constitution. Only the Third Amendment right (against involuntary \nquartering of soldiers) and the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury have not been made \napplicable to the states. Because these rights are still not applicable to state governments, the Supreme \nCourt is often said to have “selectively incorporated” the Bill of Rights into the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n169 \nThe second category of fundamental liberties includes those liberties that are not expressly stated in the \nBill of Rights but that can be seen as essential to the concepts of freedom and equality in a democratic \nsociety. These unstated liberties come from Supreme Court precedents, common law, moral philosophy, \nand deeply rooted traditions of US legal history. The Supreme Court has stressed that he \nword liberty cannot be defined by a definitive list of rights; rather, it must be viewed as a rational \ncontinuum of freedom through which every aspect of human behavior is protected from arbitrary \nimpositions and random restraints. In this regard, as the Supreme Court has observed, the due process \nclause protects abstract liberty interests, including the right to personal autonomy, bodily integrity, self-\ndignity, and self-determination. \n \nThese liberty interests often are grouped to form a general right to privacy, which was first recognized \nin Griswold v. Connecticut (Section 4.6.1), where the Supreme Court struck down a state statute \nforbidding married adults from using, possessing, or distributing contraceptives on the ground that the \nlaw violated the sanctity of the marital relationship. According to Justice Douglas’s plurality opinion, this \npenumbra of privacy, though not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, must be protected to establish \na buffer zone or breathing space for those freedoms that are constitutionally enumerated. \n \nBut substantive due process has seen fairly limited use since the 1930s. During the 1990s, the Supreme \nCourt was asked to recognize a general right to die under the doctrine of substantive due process. \nAlthough the court stopped short of establishing such a far-reaching right, certain patients may exercise a \nconstitutional liberty to hasten their deaths under a narrow set of circumstances. In Cruzan v. Missouri \nDepartment of Health, the Supreme Court ruled that the due process clause guarantees the right of \ncompetent adults to make advanced directives for the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures should they \nbecome incapacitated by a disability that leaves them in a persistent vegetative state. [4] Once it has been \nestablished by clear and convincing evidence that a mentally incompetent and persistently vegetative \npatient made such a prior directive, a spouse, parent, or other appropriate guardian may seek to terminate \nany form of artificial hydration or nutrition. \n \nFourteenth Amendment: Due Process and Equal Protection Guarantees \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n170 \nThe Fourteenth Amendment (1868) requires that states treat citizens of other states with due process. \nThis can be either an issue of procedural due process (as in Section 3.9 \"Cases\", Burger King v. \nRudzewicz) or an issue of substantive due process. For substantive due process, consider what happened \nin an Alabama court not too long ago. [5] \nThe plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW for $40,000 from a dealer in Alabama. He later discovered \nthat the vehicle’s exterior had been slightly damaged in transit from Europe and had therefore been \nrepainted by the North American distributor prior to his purchase. The vehicle was, by best estimates, \nworth about 10 percent less than he paid for it. The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely \nsold slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of \nthe car. In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages. The",

Prior to the statute’s enactment,…apples from 13 different States were shipped into North \nCarolina for sale. Seven of those States, including [Washington], had their own grading systems which, \nwhile differing in their standards, used similar descriptive labels (e.g., fancy, extra fancy, etc.). This \nmultiplicity of inconsistent state grades [posed] dangers of deception and confusion not only in the North \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n188 \nCarolina market, but in the Nation as a whole. The North Carolina statute, appellants claim, was enacted \nto eliminate this source of deception and confusion. [Moreover], it is contended that North Carolina \nsought to accomplish this goal of uniformity in an evenhanded manner as evidenced by the fact that its \nstatute applies to all apples sold in closed containers in the State without regard to their point of origin. \n[As] the appellants properly point out, not every exercise of state authority imposing some burden on the \nfree flow of commerce is invalid, [especially] when the State acts to protect its citizenry in matters \npertaining to the sale of foodstuffs. By the same token, however, a finding that state legislation furthers \nmatters of legitimate local concern, even in the health and consumer protection areas, does not end the \ninquiry. Rather, when such state legislation comes into conflict with the Commerce Clause’s overriding \nrequirement of a national “common market,” we are confronted with the task of effecting an \naccommodation of the competing national and local interests. We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The \nrecord demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the \napple trade. [The record] contains numerous affidavits [stating a] preference [for] apples graded under \nthe Washington, as opposed to the USDA, system because of the former’s greater consistency, its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n189 \nemphasis on color, and its supporting mandatory inspections. Once again, the statute had no similar \nimpact on the North Carolina apple industry and thus operated to its benefit. \n \nThird, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, \nthe statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers. \n[With] free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage \nvis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior. However, because of \nthe statute’s operation, Washington apples which would otherwise qualify for and be sold under the \nsuperior Washington grades will now have to be marketed under their inferior USDA counterparts. Such \n“downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-\nof-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit. At worst, it will have the effect of an \nembargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them \nfrom the North Carolina market. At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that \nsuch apples would otherwise command. \n \nDespite the statute’s facial neutrality, the Commission suggests that its discriminatory impact on \ninterstate commerce was not an unintended by-product, and there are some indications in the record to",

This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784. The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of \ncorporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply \nbecause such associations are not “natural persons.” \n \nThe purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations, \nfrom presenting both facts and opinions to the public. This makes Austin’s antidistortion rationale all the \nmore an aberration. “[T]he First Amendment protects the right of corporations to petition legislative and \nadministrative bodies.” Bellotti, 435 U.S., at 792, n. 31.… \n \nEven if §441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected \nofficials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so. And wealthy individuals and \nunincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures. See, e.g., WRTL, \n551 U.S., at 503–504 (opinion of Scalia, J.)

This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves. \n \nWhat we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government. For the most \npart relinquishing the anti-distortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate \npolitical speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.… \n \nWhen Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may \nnot choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from \nindependent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before \nprinciple, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to \ndispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, \nmust comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is \nthe governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is \nnot a permissible remedy. Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to \npreventing quid pro quo corruption. \n \nOur precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it \nputs us on a course that is sure error. “Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to \nadhere to the principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at \nstake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.” [citing prior cases] \n \nThese considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Austin, which itself contravened this Court’s earlier \nprecedents in Buckley and Bellotti. “This Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the \nFirst Amendment.” WRTL, 551 U.S., at 500 (opinion of Scalia, J.). “[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n197 \nand not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.” Helvering v.

See Smoodin, \n“Compulsory” Viewing for Every Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, \n19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, \nCapra’s Capitol Offense, N. Y. Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5. Under Austin, though, officials could have done \nmore than discourage its distribution—they could have banned the film. After all, it, like Hillary, was \nspeech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress. Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force. \n \nModern day movies, television comedies, or skits on YouTube.com might portray public officials or public \npolicies in unflattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the \nbackground for candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a corporation, other \nthan an exempt media corporation, has made the “purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, \ndeposit, or gift of money or anything of value” in order to engage in political speech. 2 U.S.C. \n§431(9)(A)(i). Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public \ndialogue preceding a real election.

If Congress’s guidelines are too vague or undefined, it is (in essence) giving away \nits constitutional power to some other group, and this it cannot do. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n206 \nWhy Regulate the Economy at All? \nThe market often does not work properly, as economists often note. Monopolies, for example, happen in \nthe natural course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1. There are many buyers and many sellers, and none of them has a substantial share of the market. \n2. All buyers and sellers in the market are free to enter the market or leave it. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n207 \n3. All buyers and all sellers have full and perfect knowledge of what other buyers and sellers are up to, \nincluding knowledge of prices, quantity, and quality of all goods being bought or sold. \n4. The goods being sold in the market are similar enough to each other that participants do not have \nstrong preferences as to which seller or buyer they deal with. \n5. The costs and benefits of making or using the goods that are exchanged in the market are borne only by \nthose who buy or sell those goods and not by third parties or people “external” to the market \ntransaction. (That is, there are no “externalities.”) \n6. All buyers and sellers are utility maximizers; each participant in the market tries to get as much as \npossible for as little as possible. \n7. There are no parties, institutions, or governmental units regulating the price, quantity, or quality of any \nof the goods being bought and sold in the market. \n \n \nIn short, some forms of legislation and regulation are needed to counter a tendency toward consolidation \nof economic power and discriminatory attitudes toward certain individuals and groups and to insist that \npeople and companies clean up their own messes and not hide information that would empower voluntary \nchoices in the free market. \n \nBut there are additional reasons to regulate. For example, in economic systems, it is likely for natural \nmonopolies to occur. These are where one firm can most efficiently supply all of the good or service. \nHaving duplicate (or triplicate) systems for supplying electricity, for example, would be inefficient, so \nmost states have a public utilities commission to determine both price and quality of service. This is direct \nregulation. \n \nSometimes destructive competition can result if there is no regulation. Banking and insurance are good \nexamples of this.

On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods \nsuch as education, a highway system, lighthouses, a military for defense. \n \nTrue laissez-faire capitalism—a market free from any regulation—would not try to deal with market \nimperfections and would also allow people to freely choose products, services, and other arrangements \nthat historically have been deemed socially unacceptable. These would include making enforceable \ncontracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or \ncrack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage \npartnership. \n \nThus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by \nwhat is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the \nsocial arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or \nunsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers \nfrom unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can \nbe used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment \ndiscrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and \nmonitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental \nProtection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company). \n \nHistory of Federal Agencies \nThrough the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between \nthe states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970). See Note 5.4 \"Ideal Conditions for a Free Market\" in the \nsidebar. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n210 \nBy contrast, members of executive branch agencies serve at the pleasure of the president and are therefore",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision. The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency \nactions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 \"Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review\" on \n“Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAdministrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate. But these powers \nare limited by executive and legislative controls and by judicial review. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Find the website of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Identify from that site a product that \nhas been banned by the CPSC for sale in the United States. What reasons were given for its exclusion from \nthe US market? \n2. What has Congress told the CPSC to do in its enabling act? Is this a clear enough mandate to guide the \nagency? What could Congress do if the CPSC does something that may be outside of the scope of its \npowers? What can an affected business do? \n5.3 The Administrative Procedure Act \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n216 \n1. Understand why the Administrative Procedure Act was needed. \n2. Understand how hearings are conducted under the act. \n3. Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer. The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more \naccurately reflect their duties. Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free \nof assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the \nagency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function. \nThe accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, \nto cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers. Ex parte (eks PAR-tay) communications—contacts \nbetween the ALJ and outsiders or one party when both parties are not present—are prohibited. However,",

The CPSC is also charged with educating the public about these hazards. The agency's budget for fiscal year 2015 is $114.2 million. The CPSC is led by a chairperson and four commissioners appointed by the president of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate for seven-year terms. The current chairperson is Elliot F. Kaye. The agency is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. In addition to its headquarters, the CPSC has seven regional offices around the United States."

Ex parte (eks PAR-tay) communications—contacts \nbetween the ALJ and outsiders or one party when both parties are not present—are prohibited. However, \nthe usual burden-of-proof standard followed in a civil proceeding in court does not apply: the ALJ is not \nbound to decide in favor of that party producing the more persuasive evidence. The rule in most \nadministrative proceedings is “substantial evidence,” evidence that is not flimsy or weak, but is not \nnecessarily overwhelming evidence, either. The ALJ in most cases will write an opinion. That opinion is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n217 \nnot the decision of the agency, which can be made only by the commissioners or agency head. In effect, \nthe ALJ’s opinion is appealed to the commission itself. \n \nCertain types of agency actions that have a direct impact on individuals need not be filtered through a full-\nscale hearing. Safety and quality inspections (grading of food, inspection of airplanes) can be made on the \nspot by skilled inspectors. Certain licenses can be administered through tests without a hearing (a test for \na driver’s license), and some decisions can be made by election of those affected (labor union elections). \n \nRulemaking \nTrial-type hearings generally impose on particular parties liabilities based on past or present facts. \nBecause these cases will serve as precedents, they are a partial guide to future conduct by others. But they \ndo not directly apply to nonparties, who may argue in a subsequent case that their conduct does not fit \nwithin the holding announced in the case. Agencies can affect future conduct far more directly by \nannouncing rules that apply to all who come within the agency’s jurisdiction. \n \nThe acts creating most of the major federal agencies expressly grant them authority to engage in \nrulemaking. This means, in essence, authority to legislate. The outpouring of federal regulations has been \nimmense. The APA directs agencies about to engage in rulemaking to give notice in the \nFederal Register of their intent to do so. The Federal Register is published daily, Monday through \nFriday, in Washington, DC, and contains notice of various actions, including announcements of proposed \nrulemaking and regulations as adopted. The notice must specify the time, place, and nature of the \nrulemaking and offer a description of the proposed rule or the issues involved. Any interested person or \norganization is entitled to participate by submitting written “data, views or arguments.” Agencies are not \nlegally required to air debate over proposed rules, though they often do so. \n \nThe procedure just described is known as “informal” rulemaking. A different procedure is required for \n“formal” rulemaking, defined as those instances in which the enabling legislation directs an agency to \nmake rules “on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.” When engaging in formal rulemaking, \nagencies must hold an adversary hearing. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n218 \n \nAdministrative regulations are not legally binding unless they are published. Agencies must publish in \nthe Federal Register the text of final regulations, which ordinarily do not become effective until thirty \ndays later. Every year the annual output of regulations is collected and reprinted in the \nCode of Federal Regulations (CFR), a multivolume paperback series containing all federal rules and \nregulations keyed to the fifty titles of the US Code (the compilation of all federal statutes enacted by \nCongress and grouped according to subject). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAgencies make rules that have the same effect as laws passed by Congress and the president. But such rules \n(regulations) must allow for full participation by interested parties. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) \ngoverns both rulemaking and the agency enforcement of regulations, and it provides a process for fair \nhearings. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an \nunderage patron to the store). Or a junkyard that specializes in automobiles and automobile parts may \nalso be subject to surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly likely to be active in the \nresale of stolen autos or stolen auto parts. [3] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n221 \n \nIt is also possible for inspections to take place without a search warrant and without the permission of the \nbusiness. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wished to inspect parts of the Dow \nChemical facility in Midland, Michigan, without the benefit of warrant. When they were refused, agents of \nthe EPA obtained a fairly advanced aerial mapping camera and rented an airplane to fly over the Dow \nfacility. Dow went to court for a restraining order against the EPA and a request to have the EPA turn over \nall photographs taken. But the Supreme Court ruled that the areas photographed were “open fields” and \nnot subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment. [4] \n \nAccess to Business Information in Government Files \nIn 1966, Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), opening up to the citizenry many of \nthe files of the government. (The act was amended in 1974 and again in 1976 to overcome a tendency of \nmany agencies to stall or refuse access to their files.) Under the FOIA, any person has a legally enforceable \nright of access to all government documents, with nine specific exceptions, such as classified military \nintelligence, medical files, and trade secrets and commercial or financial information if “obtained from a \nperson and privileged or confidential.” Without the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions, \nbusiness competitors could, merely by requesting it, obtain highly sensitive competitive information \nsitting in government files. \n \nA federal agency is required under the FOIA to respond to a document request within ten days. But in \npractice, months or even years may pass before the government actually responds to an FOIA request. \nRequesters must also pay the cost of locating and copying the records. Moreover, not all documents are \navailable for public inspection. Along with the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions, the \nFOIA specifically exempts the following: \n \n• \nrecords required by executive order of the president to be kept secret in the interest of national \ndefense or public policy \n• \nrecords related solely to the internal personnel rules and practice of an agency \n• \nrecords exempted from disclosure by another statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n222 \n• \ninteragency memos or decisions reflecting the deliberative process \n• \npersonnel files and other files that if disclosed, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of \npersonal privacy \n• \ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes \n• \ngeological information concerning wells \n \nNote that the government may provide such information but is not required to provide such information; \nit retains discretion to provide information or not. \n \nRegulated companies are often required to submit confidential information to the government. For these \ncompanies, submitting such information presents a danger under the FOIA of disclosure to competitors. \nTo protect information from disclosure, the company is well advised to mark each document as privileged \nand confidential so that government officials reviewing it for a FOIA request will not automatically \ndisclose it. Most agencies notify a company whose data they are about to disclose. But these practices are \nnot legally required under the FOIA. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nGovernment agencies, in order to do their jobs, collect a great deal of information from businesses.

Describe the “exhaustion of remedies” requirement. \n2. Detail various strategies for obtaining judicial review of agency rules. \n3. Explain under what circumstances it is possible to sue the government. \n \n \nNeither an administrative agency’s adjudication nor its issuance of a regulation is necessarily final. Most \nfederal agency decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts. To get to court, the appellant must \novercome numerous complex hurdles. He or she must have standing—that is, be in some sense directly \naffected by the decision or regulation. The case must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as \nfurther appeal within the agency must have been exhausted. \n \nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n224 \nBefore you can complain to court about an agency’s action, you must first try to get the agency to \nreconsider its action. Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing examiner level, there \nmust have been a decision reached that was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the decision \nto the full board. The full board must rule against you, and only then will you be heard by a court. The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose. See Section 5.6 \n\"Cases\", American Textile Manufacturers Institute v.

The inspector \nanswered no, but that Barlow’s, Inc., had simply turned up in the agency’s selection process. The inspector \nagain asked to enter the nonpublic area of the business; Mr. Barlow’s response was to inquire whether the \ninspector had a search warrant. \nThe inspector had none. Thereupon, Mr. Barlow refused the inspector admission to the employee area of \nhis business. He said he was relying on his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. \n \nThree months later, the Secretary petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to \nissue an order compelling Mr. Barlow to admit the inspector. The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries \n“long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. \n72, 74, 77 (1970). These cases are indeed exceptions, but they represent responses to relatively unique \ncircumstances. Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise. Liquor \n(Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a \nbusiness, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation. \n \n* * * \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n231 \nThe clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved \nin Colonnade and Biswell is the exception. The Secretary would make it the rule. Invoking the Walsh-\nHealey Act of 1936, 41 U.S.C. § 35 et seq., the Secretary attempts to support a conclusion that all \nbusinesses involved in interstate commerce have long been subjected to close supervision of employee \nsafety and health conditions.

In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set \nin the United States through the Constitution’s prohibition on “cruel or unusual punishments.” \n \nIt is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. But there are far too many criminal laws for \nanyone to know them all. Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of \n“criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving \nwithout a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society. You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws. Teenagers hanging around \nthe sidewalks on Main Street were sometimes arrested for “loitering.” The constitutional void-for-\nvagueness doctrine has led the courts to overturn statutes that are not clear. For example, “vagrancy” \nwas long held to be a crime, but US courts began some forty years ago to overturn vagrancy and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n243 \n“suspicious person” statutes on the grounds that they are too vague for people to know what they are \nbeing asked not to do. \nThis requirement that criminal statutes not be vague does not mean that the law always defines \ncrimes in ways that can be easily and clearly understood. Many statutes use terminology developed \nby the common-law courts. For example, a California statute defines murder as “the unlawful killing \nof a human being, with malice aforethought.” If no history backed up these words, they would be \nunconstitutionally vague. But there is a rich history of judicial decisions that provides meaning for \nmuch of the arcane language like “malice aforethought” strewn about in the statute books. \n \nBecause a crime is an act that the legislature has defined as socially harmful, the parties involved \ncannot agree among themselves to forget a particular incident, such as a barroom brawl, if the \nauthorities decide to prosecute. This is one of the critical distinctions between criminal and civil law. \nAn assault is both a crime and a tort. The person who was assaulted may choose to forgive his \nassailant and not to sue him for damages. But he cannot stop the prosecutor from bringing an \nindictment against the assailant. (However, because of crowded dockets, a victim that declines to \npress charges may cause a busy prosecutor to choose to not to bring an indictment.) \n \nA crime consists of an act defined as criminal—an actus reus—and the requisite “criminal intent.” \nSomeone who has a burning desire to kill a rival in business or romance and who may actually intend \nto murder but does not act on his desire has not committed a crime. He may have a “guilty mind”—\nthe translation of the Latin phrase mens rea—but he is guilty of no crime. A person who is forced to \ncommit a crime at gunpoint is not guilty of a crime, because although there was an act defined as \ncriminal—an actus reus—there was no criminal intent. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCrimes are usually defined by statute and constitute an offense against society.

Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

            "chunk": "Statutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car. If the finance company repossesses the car, the \ncustomer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have \ntaken the new car by larceny or embezzlement. Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the \ndealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal. \nIn most states, this is specifically defined in the statutes as theft of services. \n \nReceiving Stolen Property \nOne who engages in receiving stolen property with knowledge that it is stolen is guilty of a felony or \nmisdemeanor, depending on the value of the property. The receipt need not be personal; if the property is \ndelivered to a place under the control of the receiver, then he is deemed to have received it. “Knowledge” \nis construed broadly: not merely actual knowledge, but (correct) belief and suspicion (strong enough not \nto investigate for fear that the property will turn out to have been stolen) are sufficient for conviction. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n249 \n \nForgery \nForgery is false writing of a document of legal significance (or apparent legal significance!) with intent to \ndefraud. It includes the making up of a false document or the alteration of an existing one. The writing \nneed not be done by hand but can be by any means—typing, printing, and so forth. Documents commonly \nthe subject of forgery are negotiable instruments (checks, money orders, and the like), deeds, receipts, \ncontracts, and bills of lading. The forged instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood. If \nyou fake your neighbor’s signature on one of his checks made out to cash, you have committed forgery. \nBut if you sign a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that there is no money in your \nchecking account, the instrument is not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the intent to \ndefraud. \n \nThe mere making of a forged instrument is unlawful. So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an \ninstrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false signature is \nby no means the only way to commit forgery. If done with intent to defraud, the backdating of a \ndocument, the modification of a corporate name, or the filling in of lines left blank on a form can all \nconstitute forgery. \n \nExtortion \nUnder common law, extortion could only be committed by a government official, who corruptly \ncollected an unlawful fee under color of office. A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat",

Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who \nuses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be \nconvicted under the law. In one case, a state governor was convicted of mail fraud when he took bribes to \ninfluence the setting of racing dates. The court’s theory was that he defrauded the citizenry of its right to \nhis “honest and faithful services” as governor. [1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n252 \nViolations of the Food and Drug Act \nThe federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits any person or corporation from sending into \ninterstate commerce any adulterated or misbranded food, drug, cosmetics, or related device. For example, \nin a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a \nuse that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water \nAct, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from \n$2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are \nspecifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include \nofficers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused \nthe discharge. [2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation. The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 \"Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"). \nCongress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where \ncomputers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature. \n \nTable 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nObtaining national security information \nSec.

The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison). States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense. If Barney (who has poor sight), shoots at a tree stump, thinking it is his \nneighbor, Ralph, intending to kill him, has he committed an attempt? Many courts would hold that he has \nnot. But the distinction between factual impossibility and legal impossibility is not always clear, and the \ntrend seems to be to punish the intended attempt. \n \nConspiracy \nUnder both federal and state laws, it is a separate offense to work with others toward the commission of a \ncrime. When two or more people combine to carry out an unlawful purpose, they are engaged in a \nconspiracy. The law of conspiracy is quite broad, especially when it is used by prosecutors in connection \nwith white-collar crimes. Many people can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is unnecessary \nto show that the actions they took were sufficient to constitute either the crime or an attempt. Usually, the \nprosecution needs to show only (1) an agreement and (2) a single overt act in furtherance of the \nconspiracy. Thus if three people agree to rob a bank, and if one of them goes to a store to purchase a gun \nto be used in the holdup, the three can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery. Even the purchase \nof an automobile to be used as the getaway car could support a conspiracy conviction. \n \nThe act of any one of the conspirators is imputed to the other members of the conspiracy. It does not \nmatter, for instance, that only one of the bank robbers fired the gun that killed a guard. All can be \nconvicted of murder. That is so even if one of the conspirators was stationed as a lookout several blocks \naway and even if he specifically told the others that his agreement to cooperate would end “just as soon as \nthere is shooting.” \n \nAgency and Corporations \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n257 \nA person can be guilty of a crime if he acts through another. Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the \nguilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But imputation of guilt is not \nlimited to a conspiracy. The agent may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate officer \ndirects a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home. The employee \nreasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains \nmoney that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit. The law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in recent years. The tendency is to hold \nthe corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group \nwithin the corporation (the president or board of directors). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAlthough proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by \ninference (circumstantially). Conspirators may not actually commit a crime, for example, but in preparing for a \ncriminal act, they may be guilty of the crime of conspiracy. Certain corporate officers, as well, may not be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n258 \ndirectly committing criminal acts but may be held criminally responsible for acts of their agents and \ncontractors. \n \n \nEXERCISES",

The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis. In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of \nwhom is appointed for every federal district. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n263 \nFollowing the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document \nstating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury for \nan indictment. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence. The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment. The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff \nwill have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n264 \nFollowing a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will impose a sentence after presentencing \nreports are written by various court officials (often, probation officers). Permissible sentences are \nspelled out in statutes, though these frequently give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., \ntwenty years to life). The judge may sentence the defendant to imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may \ndecide to suspend sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence as long as he stays \nout of trouble). \n \nSentencing usually comes before appeal. As in civil cases, the defendant, now convicted, has the right \nto take at least one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and constitutional rights may \nbe argued. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCriminal procedure in US courts is designed to provide a fair process to both criminal defendants and to \nsociety. The grand jury system, prosecutorial discretion, plea bargains, and appeals for lack of a fair trial are all \npart of US criminal procedure. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nWe granted certiorari to consider whether the jury instructions in the prosecution of a corporate officer \nunder § 301 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1042, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 331 \n(k), were appropriate under United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943). Acme Markets, Inc., is a \nnational retail food chain with approximately 36,000 employees, 874 retail outlets, 12 general \nwarehouses, and four special warehouses. Its headquarters, including the office of the president, \nrespondent Park, who is chief executive officer of the corporation, are located in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. In a five-count information filed in the United States District Court for the District of \nMaryland, the Government charged Acme and respondent with violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act. Each count of the information alleged that the defendants had received food that had been \nshipped in interstate commerce and that, while the food was being held for sale in Acme’s Baltimore \nwarehouse following shipment in interstate commerce, they caused it to be held in a building accessible to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n272 \nrodents and to be exposed to contamination by rodents. These acts were alleged to have resulted in the \nfood’s being adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. §§ 342 (a)(3) and (4), in violation of 21 U.S.C. § \n331 (k). \n \nAcme pleaded guilty to each count of the information. Respondent pleaded not guilty. The evidence at \ntrial demonstrated that in April 1970 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised respondent by \nletter of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. In 1971 the FDA found that similar \nconditions existed in the firm’s Baltimore warehouse. An FDA consumer safety officer testified concerning \nevidence of rodent infestation and other insanitary conditions discovered during a 12-day inspection of \nthe Baltimore warehouse in November and December 1971. He also related that a second inspection of the \nwarehouse had been conducted in March 1972. On that occasion the inspectors found that there had been \nimprovement in the sanitary conditions, but that “there was still evidence of rodent activity in the building \nand in the warehouses and we found some rodent-contaminated lots of food items.” \n \nThe Government also presented testimony by the Chief of Compliance of the FDA’s Baltimore office, who \ninformed respondent by letter of the conditions at the Baltimore warehouse after the first inspection. \nThere was testimony by Acme’s Baltimore division vice president, who had responded to the letter on \nbehalf of Acme and respondent and who described the steps taken to remedy the insanitary conditions \ndiscovered by both inspections. The Government’s final witness, Acme’s vice president for legal affairs \nand assistant secretary, identified respondent as the president and chief executive officer of the company \nand read a bylaw prescribing the duties of the chief executive officer. He testified that respondent \nfunctioned by delegating “normal operating duties” including sanitation, but that he retained “certain \nthings, which are the big, broad, principles of the operation of the company and had “the responsibility of \nseeing that they all work together.” \n \nAt the close of the Government’s case in chief, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \nground that “the evidence in chief has shown that Mr. Park is not personally concerned in this Food and \nDrug violation.” The trial judge denied the motion, stating that United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 \n(1943), was controlling. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n273 \n \nRespondent was the only defense witness. He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating",

In Dotterweich, a jury had disagreed as to \nthe corporation, a jobber purchasing drugs from manufacturers and shipping them in interstate \ncommerce under its own label, but had convicted Dotterweich, the corporation’s president and general \nmanager.

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

            "chunk": "means straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting \nsomeone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet \nthe law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a \nremedy for \"defaming\" someone, orally or in writing, to others. \n \nAlthough the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines. More and \nmore people injured by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of remedy through the \ncourts). Headlines boast of multimillion-dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations, \nagainst newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against oil companies that devastate entire \necosystems. All are examples of tort suits. \n \nThe law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by \nlegislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the \ncommon law (judicial decisions). Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules \nthat govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other. Through \ncontracts, individuals can craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other. In the absence of \ncontracts, tort law holds individuals legally accountable for the consequences of their actions. Those who \nsuffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated. \n \nMany acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious. But torts and crimes are different, and the \ndifference is worth noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society punishes the murderer; \nit does not usually compensate the family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a \nprivate wrong for which damages are owed. In a civil case, the tort victim or his family, not the state, \nbrings the action. The judgment against a defendant in a civil tort suit is usually expressed in monetary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n283 \nterms, not in terms of prison times or fines, and is the legal system’s way of trying to make up for the \nvictim’s loss. \n \nKinds of Torts \nThere are three kinds of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts, and strict liability torts. Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.

One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still another excuse is consent: two \nboxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear). \n \nDamages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n286 \nSince the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually \nmeasured by the extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the",

If a driver runs a red light, we can say that he is negligent \nbecause a driver must always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be able to stop if it is. \nSuppose that the driver was carrying a badly injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing \ndown at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n298 \nseeing him, drove into the intersection anyway and crashed into him. Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot? (Answer: in most cases, yes.) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n299 \nDespite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable man is one on which most negligence cases \nultimately turn. If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed \nan unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most \ninstances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do. The reasonable man stops for \ntraffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs \nsurgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of \nhis grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions \nto avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The \"reasonable man\" standard imposes hindsight \non the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may \nsometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable. \n \nDuty of Care and Its Breach \nThe law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person. If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in \nthis interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might \nsubject us to liability for its effect on someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the \nnumber of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful. \n \nIn general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the \ndrowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase. For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold.",

An increasing \nnumber of courts have eased the plaintiff’s predicament by ruling that the statute of limitations does not \nbegin to run until the victim discovers that she has been injured or contracted a disease. \n \nThe law allows an exception to the general rule that damages must be shown when the plaintiff stands in \ndanger of immediate injury from a hazardous activity. If you discover your neighbor experimenting with \nexplosives in his basement, you could bring suit to enjoin him from further experimentation, even though \nhe has not yet blown up his house—and yours. \n \nProblems of Proof \nThe plaintiff in a tort suit, as in any other, has the burden of proving his allegations. \n \nHe must show that the defendant took the actions complained of as negligent, demonstrate the \ncircumstances that make the actions negligent, and prove the occurrence and extent of injury. Factual \nissues are for the jury to resolve. Since it is frequently difficult to make out the requisite proof, the law \nallows certain presumptions and rules of evidence that ease the plaintiff’s task, on the ground that without \nthem substantial injustice would be done. One important rule goes by the Latin \nphrase res ipsa loquitur, meaning “the thing speaks for itself.” The best evidence is always the most \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n302 \ndirect evidence: an eyewitness account of the acts in question. But eyewitnesses are often unavailable, and \nin any event they frequently cannot testify directly to the reasonableness of someone’s conduct, which \ninevitably can only be inferred from the circumstances. \n \nIn many cases, therefore, circumstantial evidence (evidence that is indirect) will be the only evidence \nor will constitute the bulk of the evidence. Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no \none saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly \nconclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference \nof negligence. A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of \nnegligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, \nand the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the \nmanagement use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the \ndefendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] \n \nIf a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane \ncrashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the \ndefendants, that there was negligence. The plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining \nprecisely how the accident occurred. A defendant can always offer evidence that he acted reasonably—for \nexample, that the flour barrel was securely fastened and that a bolt of lightning, for which he was not \nresponsible, broke its bands, causing it to roll out the window. But testimony by the factory employees \nthat they secured the barrel, in the absence of any further explanation, will not usually serve to rebut the \ninference. That the defendant was negligent does not conclude the inquiry or automatically entitle the \nplaintiff to a judgment. Tort law provides the defendant with several excuses, some of which are discussed \nbriefly in the next section. \nExcuses \nThere are more excuses (defenses) than are listed here, but contributory negligence or comparative \nnegligence, assumption of risk, and act of God are among the principal defenses that will completely or \npartially excuse the negligence of the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n303 \nContributory and Comparative Negligence \nUnder an old common-law rule, it was a complete defense to show that the plaintiff in a negligence suit \nwas himself negligent. Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most of the fault being chargeable to \nthe defendant, the court would dismiss the suit if the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to his injury. In a few \nstates today, this rule of contributory negligence is still in effect. Although referred to as negligence, \nthe rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which the defendant is charged, because the \nplaintiff’s only error in such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have been, whereas the \ndefendant is charged with conduct careless toward others. This rule was so manifestly unjust in many \ncases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version \nof comparative negligence. Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned \naccording to the defendant’s degree of culpability. For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages.",

For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages. \n \nAssumption of Risk \nRisk of injury pervades the modern world, and plaintiffs should not win a lawsuit simply because they \ntook a risk and lost. The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she \nmust suffer the consequences. \n \nThe assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways. The plaintiff may have formally agreed with the \ndefendant before entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of liability should injury \noccur. (“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I \nhaven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the \ndefendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is \nhit by a line drive in a ballpark). Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known in advance \nto have been created by the defendant’s negligence (failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do \nso, such as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be drunk). \n \nThe difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing line between subjectivity and objectivity. If the \nplaintiff had no actual knowledge of the risk, he cannot be held to have assumed it. On the other hand, it is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n304 \neasy to claim that you did not appreciate the danger, and the courts will apply an objective standard of \ncommunity knowledge (a “but you should have known” test) in many situations. When the plaintiff has no \nreal alternative, however, assumption of risk fails as a defense (e.g., a landlord who negligently fails to \nlight the exit to the street cannot claim that his tenants assumed the risk of using it). \n \nAt the turn of the century, courts applied assumption of risk in industrial cases to bar relief to workers \ninjured on the job. They were said to assume the risk of dangerous conditions or equipment. This rule has \nbeen abolished by workers’ compensation statutes in most states. \n \nAct of God \nTechnically, the rule that no one is responsible for an “act of God,” or force majeure as it is sometimes \ncalled, is not an excuse but a defense premised on a lack of causation. If a force of nature caused the harm, \nthen the defendant was not negligent in the first place. A marina, obligated to look after boats moored at \nits dock, is not liable if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was possible destroys \nsomeone’s vessel. However, if it is foreseeable that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by \na natural event, then there is liability. For example, a work crew failed to remove residue explosive gas \nfrom an oil barge. Lightning hit the barge, exploded the gas, and injured several workmen. The plaintiff \nrecovered damages against the company because the negligence consisted in the failure to guard against \nany one of a number of chance occurrences that could ignite the gas. [3] \n \nVicarious Liability \nLiability for negligent acts does not always end with the one who was negligent. Under certain \ncircumstances, the liability is imputed to others. For example, an employer is responsible for the \nnegligence of his employees if they were acting in the scope of employment. This rule of vicarious liability \nis often called respondeat superior, meaning that the higher authority must respond to claims brought \nagainst one of its agents. Respondeat superior is not limited to the employment relationship but extends \nto a number of other agency relationships as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n305 \nLegislatures in many states have enacted laws that make people vicariously liable for acts of certain people \nwith whom they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency. It is common, for example, for \nthe owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car. So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others. In these situations, although the injurious \nact of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) \nis not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now",

Yuba Power Products, Inc. \n \nIn Greenman, the plaintiff had used a home power saw and bench, the Shopsmith, designed and \nmanufactured by the defendant. He was experienced in using power tools and was injured while using the \napproved lathe attachment to the Shopsmith to fashion a wooden chalice. The case was decided on the \npremise that Greenman had done nothing wrong in using the machine but that the machine had a defect \nthat was “latent” (not easily discoverable by the consumer). Rather than decide the case based on \nwarranties, or requiring that Greenman prove how the defendant had been negligent, Justice Traynor \nfound for the plaintiff based on the overall social utility of strict liability in cases of defective products. \nAccording to his decision, the purpose of such liability is to ensure that the “cost of injuries resulting from \ndefective products is borne by the manufacturers…rather than by the injured persons who are powerless \nto protect themselves.” \n \nToday, the majority of US states recognize strict liability for defective products, although some states limit \nstrict liability actions to damages for personal injuries rather than property damage. Injured plaintiffs \nhave to prove the product caused the harm but do not have to prove exactly how the manufacturer was \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n308 \ncareless. Purchasers of the product, as well as injured guests, bystanders, and others with no direct \nrelationship with the product, may sue for damages caused by the product. \n \nThe Restatement of the Law of Torts, Section 402(a), was originally issued in 1964. It is a widely accepted \nstatement of the liabilities of sellers of goods for defective products. The Restatement specifies six \nrequirements, all of which must be met for a plaintiff to recover using strict liability for a product that the \nplaintiff claims is defective: \n \n1. The product must be in a defective condition when the defendant sells it. \n2. The defendant must normally be engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing the \nproduct. \n3. The product must be unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer because of its defective \ncondition. \n4. The plaintiff must incur physical harm to self or to property by using or consuming the product. \n5. The defective condition must be the proximate cause of the injury or damage. \n6. The goods must not have been substantially changed from the time the product was sold to the time the \ninjury was sustained. \nSection 402(a) also explicitly makes clear that a defendant can be held liable even though the defendant \nhas exercised “all possible care.” Thus in a strict liability case, the plaintiff does not need to show “fault” \n(or negligence). \n \nFor defendants, who can include manufacturers, distributors, processors, assemblers, packagers, bottlers, \nretailers, and wholesalers, there are a number of defenses that are available, including assumption of risk, \nproduct misuse and comparative negligence, commonly known dangers, and the knowledgeable-user \ndefense. We have already seen assumption of risk and comparative negligence in terms of negligence \nactions; the application of these is similar in products-liability actions. \n \nUnder product misuse, a plaintiff who uses a product in an unexpected and unusual way will not recover \nfor injuries caused by such misuse. For example, suppose that someone uses a rotary lawn mower to trim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n309 \na hedge and that after twenty minutes of such use loses control because of its weight and suffers serious \ncuts to his abdomen after dropping it. Here, there would be a defense of product misuse, as well as \ncontributory negligence. Consider the urban (or Internet) legend of Mervin Gratz, who supposedly put his \nWinnebago on autopilot to go back and make coffee in the kitchen, then recovered millions after his \nWinnebago turned over and he suffered serious injuries. There are multiple defenses to this alleged \naction; these would include the defenses of contributory negligence, comparative negligence, and product \nmisuse. (There was never any such case, and certainly no such recovery; it is not known who started this \nlegend, or why.) \n \nAnother defense against strict liability as a cause of action is the knowledgeable user defense. If the \nparents of obese teenagers bring a lawsuit against McDonald’s, claiming that its fast-food products are \ndefective and that McDonald’s should have warned customers of the adverse health effects of eating its \nproducts, a defense based on the knowledgeable user is available. In one case, the court found that the",

University of Denver \n744 P.2d 54 (Supreme Court of Colorado1987) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n313 \nOn June 19, 1978, at approximately 10:00 p.m., plaintiff Oscar Whitlock suffered a paralyzing injury while \nattempting to complete a one-and-three-quarters front flip on a trampoline. The injury rendered him a \nquadriplegic. The trampoline was owned by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity (the Beta house) and was situated \non the front yard of the fraternity premises, located on the University campus. At the time of his injury, \nWhitlock was twenty years old, attended the University of Denver, and was a member of the Beta house, \nwhere he held the office of acting house manager. The property on which the Beta house was located was \nleased to the local chapter house association of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by the defendant University of \nDenver. \n \nWhitlock had extensive experience jumping on trampolines. He began using trampolines in junior high \nschool and continued to do so during his brief tenure as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point, where he learned to execute the one-and-three-quarters front flip. Whitlock testified that he \nutilized the trampoline at West Point every other day for a period of two months. He began jumping on \nthe trampoline owned by the Beta house in September of 1977. Whitlock recounted that in the fall and \nspring prior to the date of his injury, he jumped on the trampoline almost daily. He testified further that \nprior to the date of his injury, he had successfully executed the one-and-three-quarters front flip between \nseventy-five and one hundred times. \n \nDuring the evening of June 18 and early morning of June 19, 1978, Whitlock attended a party at the Beta \nhouse, where he drank beer, vodka and scotch until 2:00 a.m. Whitlock then retired and did not awaken \nuntil 2:00 p.m. on June 19. He testified that he jumped on the trampoline between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 \np.m., and again at 7:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the time of the injury, there again was a party in progress at \nthe Beta house, and Whitlock was using the trampoline with only the illumination from the windows of \nthe fraternity house, the outside light above the front door of the house, and two street lights in the area. \nAs Whitlock attempted to perform the one-and-three-quarters front flip, he landed on the back of his \nhead, causing his neck to break. \n \nWhitlock brought suit against the manufacturer and seller of the trampoline, the University, the Beta \nTheta Pi fraternity and its local chapter, and certain individuals in their capacities as representatives of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n314 \nthe Beta Theta Pi organizations. Whitlock reached settlements with all of the named defendants except \nthe University, so only the negligence action against the University proceeded to trial. The jury returned a \nverdict in favor of Whitlock, assessing his total damages at $ 7,300,000. The jury attributed twenty-eight \npercent of causal negligence to the conduct of Whitlock and seventy-two percent of causal negligence to \nthe conduct of the University. The trial court accordingly reduced the amount of the award against the \nUniversity to $ 5,256,000.",

Whitlock v. University of Denver, 712 P.2d \n1072 (Colo. App. 1985). The court of appeals held that the University owed Whitlock a duty of due care to \nremove the trampoline from the fraternity premises or to supervise its use.…The case was remanded to \nthe trial court with orders to reinstate the verdict and damages as determined by the jury. The University \nthen petitioned for certiorari review, and we granted that petition. \n \nII. \nA negligence claim must fail if based on circumstances for which the law imposes no duty of care upon the \ndefendant for the benefit of the plaintiff. [Citations] Therefore, if Whitlock’s judgment against the \nUniversity is to be upheld, it must first be determined that the University owed a duty of care to take \nreasonable measures to protect him against the injury that he sustained. \n \nWhether a particular defendant owes a legal duty to a particular plaintiff is a question of law. [Citations] \n“The court determines, as a matter of law, the existence and scope of the duty—that is, whether the \nplaintiff’s interest that has been infringed by the conduct of the defendant is entitled to legal protection.” \n[Citations] In Smith v. City & County of Denver, 726 P.2d 1125 (Colo. 1986), we set forth several factors to \nbe considered in determining the existence of duty in a particular case: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n315 \nWhether the law should impose a duty requires consideration of many factors including, for \nexample, the risk involved, the foreseeability and likelihood of injury as weighed against the \nsocial utility of the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against injury or \nharm, and the consequences of placing the burden upon the actor. \n \n…A court’s conclusion that a duty does or does not exist is “an expression of the sum total of those \nconsiderations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is [or is not] entitled to protection.” \n… \nWe believe that the fact that the University is charged with negligent failure to act rather than negligent \naffirmative action is a critical factor that strongly militates against imposition of a duty on the University \nunder the facts of this case. In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the \nlaw has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active \nmisconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps \nto protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373. Liability for nonfeasance was slow to \nreceive recognition in the law. “The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by \n‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has \nat least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his \naffairs.” Id. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) summarizes the law on this point as follows: \n \nThe fact that an actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s \naid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action. \n \nImposition of a duty in all such cases would simply not meet the test of fairness under contemporary \nstandards. \n \nIn nonfeasance cases the existence of a duty has been recognized only during the last century in situations \ninvolving a limited group of special relationships between parties. Such special relationships are \npredicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies \nthe imposition of a duty to act.” W. Keeton, § 56, at 374.

The authors of the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 A, comment b (1965), state that “the law \nappears…to be working slowly toward a recognition of the duty to aid or protect in any relation of \ndependence or of mutual dependence.” \n… \n \nIII. \nThe present case involves the alleged negligent failure to act, rather than negligent action. The plaintiff \ndoes not complain of any affirmative action taken by the University, but asserts instead that the \nUniversity owed to Whitlock the duty to assure that the fraternity’s trampoline was used only under \nsupervised conditions comparable to those in a gymnasium class, or in the alternative to cause the \ntrampoline to be removed from the front lawn of the Beta house.…If such a duty is to be recognized, it \nmust be grounded on a special relationship between the University and Whitlock. According to the \nevidence, there are only two possible sources of a special relationship out of which such a duty could arise \nin this case: the status of Whitlock as a student at the University, and the lease between the University and \nthe fraternity of which Whitlock was a member. We first consider the adequacy of the student-university \nrelationship as a possible basis for imposing a duty on the University to control or prohibit the use of the \ntrampoline, and then examine the provisions of the lease for that same purpose. \n \nA. \nThe student-university relationship has been scrutinized in several jurisdictions, and it is generally agreed \nthat a university is not an insurer of its students’ safety. [Citations] The relationship between a university \nand its students has experienced important change over the years. At one time, college administrators and \nfaculties stood in loco parentis to their students, which created a special relationship “that imposed a duty \non the college to exercise control over student conduct and, reciprocally, gave the students certain rights \nof protection by the college.” Bradshaw, 612 F.2d at 139. However, in modern times there has evolved a \ngradual reapportionment of responsibilities from the universities to the students, and a corresponding \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n317 \ndeparture from the in loco parentis relationship. Id. at 139–40. Today, colleges and universities are \nregarded as educational institutions rather than custodial ones. Beach, 726 P.2d at 419 (contrasting \ncolleges and universities with elementary and high schools). \n… \n…By imposing a duty on the University in this case, the University would be encouraged to exercise more \ncontrol over private student recreational choices, thereby effectively taking away much of the \nresponsibility recently recognized in students for making their own decisions with respect to private \nentertainment and personal safety. Such an allocation of responsibility would “produce a repressive and \ninhospitable environment, largely inconsistent with the objectives of a modern college \neducation.” Beach, 726 P.2d at 419. \n \nThe evidence demonstrates that only in limited instances has the University attempted to impose \nregulations or restraints on the private recreational pursuits of its students, and the students have not \nlooked to the University to assure the safety of their recreational choices. Nothing in the University’s \nstudent handbook, which contains certain regulations concerning student conduct, reflects an effort by \nthe University to control the risk-taking decisions of its students in their private recreation.…Indeed, \nfraternity and sorority self-governance with minimal supervision appears to have been fostered by the \nUniversity. \n \n… \n \nAside from advising the Beta house on one occasion to put the trampoline up when not in use, there is no \nevidence that the University officials attempted to assert control over trampoline use by the fraternity \nmembers. We conclude from this record that the University’s very limited actions concerning safety of \nstudent recreation did not give Whitlock or the other members of campus fraternities or sororities any \nreason to depend upon the University for evaluation of the safety of trampoline use.…Therefore, we",

In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform. Responding to this development the American Law Institute \nestablished a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code. Various subcommittees \nwent to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published. Twelve more states adopted \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n333 \nthe code, eleven of them the 1962 text. By 1966, only three states and two territories had failed to enact \nany version: Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Guam, and Puerto Rico. \n \nMeanwhile, non-uniform provisions continued to be enacted in various states, particularly in Article 9, to \nwhich 337 such amendments had been made. In 1971, a redraft of that article was readied and the 1972 \nOfficial Text was published. By that time, Louisiana was the only holdout. Two years later, in 1974, \nLouisiana made the UCC a truly national law when it enacted some but not all of the 1972 text \n(significantly, Louisiana has not adopted Article 2). One more major change was made, a revision of \nArticle 8, necessitated by the electronics revolution that led to new ways of transferring investment \nsecurities from seller to purchaser. This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity. A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on. However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet \nof one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods. The Code deals with phases of this \ntransaction from start to finish. These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: \n \n• \nSales (Article 2) \n• \nCommercial Paper (Article 3) \n• \nBank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) \n• \nLetters of Credit (Article 5) \n• \nBulk Transfers (Article 6) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n334 \n• \nWarehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) \n• \nInvestment Securities (Article 8) \n• \nSecured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) \n \nWe now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction. \nSales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined \n(Section 2-105) in part as “all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for \nsale other than the money in which the price is to be paid. . . .” The only contracts and agreements covered \nby Article 2 are those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \n \nIn certain cases, the courts have difficulty in determining the nature of the object of a sales contract. The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of \ngoods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only \nincidentally used, with Newmark v. Gimbel’s Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), in which the court said “[i]f \nthe permanent wave lotion were sold … for home consumption . . . unquestionably an implied warranty of \nfitness for that purpose would have been an integral incident of the sale.” The New Jersey court rejected \nthe defendant’s argument that by actually applying the lotion to the patron’s head the salon lessened the \nliability it otherwise would have had if it had simply sold her the lotion. \n \nIn two areas, state legislatures have taken the goods vs. services issue out of the courts’ hands and",

UCC Section 2·314(1) states that any seller who is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n335 \nregularly a merchant of the goods sold impliedly warrants their merchantability in a contract for their \nsale. This section explicitly declares that serving food or drink is a sale, whether they are to be consumed \non or off the premises. \n \nThe second type of case involves blood transfusions, which can give a patient hepatitis, a serious and \nsometimes fatal disease. Hospitals and blood banks obviously face large potential liability under the UCC \nprovision just referred to on implied warranty of merchantability. Because medical techniques cannot \ndetect the hepatitis virus in any form of blood used, hospitals and blood banks would be in constant \njeopardy, without being able to take effective action to minimize the danger. Most states have enacted \nlegislation specifically providing that blood supplies to be used in transfusions are a service, not goods, \nthus relieving the suppliers and hospitals of an onerous burden. \n \nThree Basic Contract Types: Sources of Law \nWith this brief description of the UCC, it should now be clear that the primary sources of law for the three \nbasic types of contracts are: \n \n• \nReal estate: common law; \n• \nServices: common law; \n• \nSale of goods: UCC (as interpreted by the courts). \n \nCommon law and UCC rules are often similar. For example, both require good faith in the performance of \na contract. However, there are two general differences worth noting between the common law of contracts \nand the UCC’s rules governing the sales of goods. First, the UCC is more liberal than the common law in \nupholding the existence of a contract. For example, in a sales contract (covered by the UCC), “open” \nterms—that is, those the parties have not agreed upon—do not require a court to rule that no contract was \nmade. However, open terms in a nonsales contract will frequently result in a ruling that there is no \ncontract. Second, although the common law of contracts applies to every person equally, under the UCC \n“merchants” occasionally receive special treatment. By “merchants” the UCC means persons who have \nspecial knowledge or skill who deal in the goods involved in the transaction. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n336 \n \nThe Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods \nA Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) was approved in 1980 at \na diplomatic conference in Vienna. (A convention is a preliminary agreement that serves as the basis for a \nformal treaty.) The Convention has been adopted by several countries, including the United States. \n \nThe Convention is significant for three reasons. First, the Convention is a uniform law governing the sale \nof goods—in effect, an international Uniform Commercial Code. The major goal of the drafters was to \nproduce a uniform law acceptable to countries with different legal, social and economic systems. Second, \nalthough provisions in the Convention are generally consistent with the UCC, there are significant \ndifferences. For instance, under the Convention, consideration (discussed below) is not required to form a \ncontract and there is no Statute of Frauds (a requirement that some contracts be evidenced by a writing to \nbe enforceable—also discussed below). Finally, the Convention represents the first attempt by the US \nSenate to reform the private law of business through its treaty powers, for the Convention preempts the \nUCC if the parties to a contract elect to use the CISG. \n \nBasic Contract Taxonomy \nContracts are not all cut from the same die. Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only",

Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement. For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car. Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you.",

The offeree must manifest his \nassent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer. Complications arise when an \noffer is accepted indirectly through correspondence. Although offers and revocations of offers are not \neffective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner \nspecified by the offeror. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n343 \n \nIf the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the \nofferee uses a reasonable method of acceptance. It is implied that the offeree can use the same means used \nby the offeror or a means of communication customary to the industry. For example, the use of the postal \nservice was so customary that acceptances are considered effective when mailed, regardless of the method \nused to transmit the offer. Indeed, the so-called “mailbox rule” (the acceptance is effective upon dispatch) \nhas an ancient lineage, tracing back nearly two hundred years to the English courts. [2] \nConsideration \nConsideration, is the quid pro quo (something given or received for something else) between the \ncontracting parties in the absence of which the law will not enforce the promise or promises made. \nConsider the following three “contracts”: \n \n1. Betty offers to give a book to Lou. Lou accepts. \n2. Betty offers Lou the book in exchange for Lou’s promise to pay $15. Lou accepts. \n3. Betty offers to give Lou the book if Lou promises to pick it up at Betty’s house. Lou accepts. \n \nThe question is which, if any, is a binding contract? In American law, only situation 2 is a binding \ncontract, because only that contract contains a set of mutual promises in which each party pledges to give \nup something to the benefit of the other. \n \nThe question of what constitutes a binding contract has been answered differently throughout history and \nin other cultures. For example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing was binding, \nwhether or not there was consideration in our sense. Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of \ngifts were made binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the United States. And in \nthe Anglo-American tradition, the presence of a seal was once sufficient to make a contract binding \nwithout any other consideration. In most states, the seal is no longer a substitute for consideration, \nalthough in some states it creates a presumption of consideration. The Uniform Commercial Code has \nabolished the seal on contracts for the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n344 \nThe existence of consideration is determined by examining whether the person against whom a promise is \nto be enforced (the promisor) received something in return from the person to whom he made the \npromise (the promisee). That may seem a simple enough question. But as with much in the law, the \ncomplicating situations are never very far away. The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor. Whether \nconsideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to \nmake the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment. (Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the \npromisor is sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did \nthe promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise? Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting. In the third example, \nwhat might appear to be such a promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou \ncome to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift. Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book.",

Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book. \n \nThere is a widely recognized exception to the requirement of consideration. In cases of promissory \nestoppel, the courts will enforce promises without consideration. Simply \nstated, promissory estoppel means that the courts will stop the promisor from claiming that there was \nno consideration. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is invoked in the interests of justice when three \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n345 \nconditions are met: (1) the promise is one that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce the \npromisee to take action or forbear from taking action of a definite and substantial character; (2) the action \nor forbearance is taken; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise. \nTimko served on the board of trustees of a school. He recommended that the school purchase a building \nfor a substantial sum of money, and to induce the trustees to vote for the purchase, he promised to help \nwith the purchase and to pay at the end of five years the purchase price less the down payment. At the end \nof four years, Timko died. The school sued his estate, which defended on the ground that there was no \nconsideration for the promise. Timko was promised or given nothing in return, and the purchase of the \nbuilding was of no direct benefit to him (which would have made the promise enforceable as a unilateral \ncontract). The court ruled that under the three-pronged promissory estoppel test, Timko’s estate was \nliable. [3] \n \nIllegality \nIn general, illegal contracts are unenforceable. The courts must grapple with two types of illegalities: (1) \nstatutory violations (e.g., the practice of law by a non-lawyer is forbidden by statute), and (2) violations of \npublic policy not expressly declared unlawful by statute, but so declared by the courts. \n \nCapacity \nA contract is a meeting of minds. If someone lacks mental capacity to understand what he is assenting \nto—or that he is assenting to anything—it is unreasonable to hold him to the consequences of his act. \n \nThe general rule is that persons younger than eighteen can avoid their contracts. Although the age of \nmajority was lowered in most states during the 1970s to correspond to the Twenty-sixth Amendment \n(ratified in 1971, guaranteeing the right to vote at eighteen), some states still put the age of majority at \ntwenty-one. Legal rights for those under twenty-one remain ambiguous, however. Although eighteen-\nyear-olds may assent to binding contracts, not all creditors and landlords believe it, and they may require \nparents to cosign. For those under twenty-one, there are also legal impediments to holding certain kinds \nof jobs, signing certain kinds of contracts, marrying, leaving home, and drinking alcohol. There is as yet \nno uniform set of rules. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n346 \nThe exact day on which the disability of minority vanishes also varies. The old common law rule put it on \nthe day before the twenty-first birthday. Many states have changed this rule so that majority commences \non the day of the eighteenth (or twenty-first) birthday. \n \nA minor’s contract is voidable, not void. A child wishing to avoid the contract need do nothing positive to \ndisaffirm; the defense of minority to a lawsuit is sufficient. Although the adult cannot enforce the contract, \nthe child can (which is why it is said to be voidable, not void). \n \nWhen the minor becomes an adult, he has two choices: he may ratify the contract or disaffirm it. She \nmay ratify explicitly; no further consideration is necessary. She may also do so by implication—for \ninstance, by continuing to make payments or retaining goods for an unreasonable period of time. (In \nsome states, a court may ratify the contract before the child becomes an adult. In California, for example, \na state statute permits a movie producer to seek court approval of a contract with a child actor in order to \nprevent the child from disaffirming it upon reaching majority and suing for additional wages. As quid pro \nquo, the court can order the producer to pay a percentage of the wages into a trust fund that the child’s \nparents or guardians cannot invade.) If the child has not disaffirmed the contract while still a minor, she \nmay do so within a reasonable time after reaching majority.",

Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the \nend of three months” or “on midnight, December 31”). An agreement may also terminate on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n435 \naccomplishment of a specified act (“on the sale of the house”) or following a specific event (“at the \nconclusion of the last horse race”). \n \nMutual consent between the parties will end the agency. Moreover, the principal may revoke the agency or \nthe agent may renounce it; such a revocation or renunciation of agency would be an express \ntermination. Even a contract that states the agreement is irrevocable will not be binding, although it can \nbe the basis for a damage suit against the one who breached the agreement by revoking or renouncing it. \nAs with any contract, a person has the power to breach, even in absence of the right to do so. If the agency \nis coupled with an interest, however, so that the authority to act is given to secure an interest that the \nagent has in the subject matter of the agency, then the principal lacks the power to revoke the agreement. \n \nImplied Termination \nThere are a number of other circumstances that will spell the end of the relationship by implication. \nUnspecified events or changes in business conditions or the value of the subject matter of the agency \nmight lead to a reasonable inference that the agency should be terminated or suspended; for example, the \nprincipal desires the agent to buy silver but the silver market unexpectedly rises and silver doubles in \nprice overnight. Other circumstances that end the agency include disloyalty of the agent (e.g., he accepts \nan appointment that is adverse to his first principal or embezzles from the principal), bankruptcy of the \nagent or of the principal, the outbreak of war (if it is reasonable to infer that the principal, knowing of the \nwar, would not want the agent to continue to exercise authority), and a change in the law that makes a \ncontinued carrying out of the task illegal or seriously interferes with it. \n \n \nBy Operation of Law \nAside from the express termination (by agreement of both or upon the insistence of one), or the necessary \nor reasonable inferences that can be drawn from their agreements, the law voids agencies under certain \ncircumstances. The most frequent termination by operation of law is the death of a principal or an agent. \nThe death of an agent also terminates the authority of subagents he has appointed, unless the principal \nhas expressly consented to the continuing validity of their appointment. Similarly, if the agent or principal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n436 \nloses capacity to enter into an agency relationship, it is suspended or terminated. The agency terminates if \nits purpose becomes illegal. \n \nEven though authority has terminated, whether by action of the parties or operation of law, the principal \nmay still be subject to liability. Apparent authority in many instances will still exist; this is \ncalled lingering authority. It is imperative for a principal on termination of authority to notify all those \nwho may still be in a position to deal with the agent. The only exceptions to this requirement are when \ntermination is effected by death, loss of the principal’s capacity, or an event that would make it impossible \nto carry out the object of the agency. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA person is always liable for her own torts, so an agent who commits a tort is liable; if the tort was in the \nscope of employment the principal is liable too. Unless the principal put the agent up to committing the tort, \nthe agent will have to reimburse the principal. An agent is not generally liable for contracts made; the \nprincipal is liable. But the agent will be liable if he is undisclosed or partially disclosed, if the agent lacks \nauthority or exceeds it, or, of course, if the agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. \nAgencies terminate expressly or impliedly or by operation of law. An agency terminates expressly by the terms \nof the agreement or mutual consent, or by the principal’s revocation or the agent’s renunciation. An agency \nterminates impliedly by any number of circumstances in which it is reasonable to assume one or both of the \nparties would not want the relationship to continue. An agency will terminate by operation of law when one",

How can this case and Lyon v. Carey (Section 10.4.2 \"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: \nScope of Employment\") be reconciled? Both involve an agent’s unacceptable behavior—assault—but \nin Lyon the agent’s actions were imputed to the principal, and in Cockrell the agent’s actions were not \nimputed to the principal. \n2. What is the controlling rule of law governing the principal’s liability for the agent’s actions? \n3. The law governing the liability of principals for acts of their agents is well settled. Thus the cases turn on the \nfacts. Who decides what the facts are in a lawsuit? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nA contract made by an agent on behalf of the principal legally binds the principal. Three types of authority \nmay bind the principal: (1) express authority—that which is actually given and spelled out, (2) implied \nauthority—that which may fairly be inferred from the parties’ relationship and which is incidental to the \nagent’s express authority, and (3) apparent authority—that which reasonably appears to a third party \nunder the circumstances to have been given by the principal. Even in the absence of authority, a principal \nmay ratify the agent’s acts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n452 \nThe principal may be liable for tortious acts of the agent but except under certain regulatory statutes may \nnot be held criminally liable for criminal acts of agents not prompted by the principal. Under the doctrine \nof respondeat superior, a principal is generally liable for acts by a servant within the scope of employment. \nA principal usually will not be held liable for acts of nonservant agents that cause physical damage, \nalthough he will be held liable for nonphysical torts, such as misrepresentation. The principal will not be \nheld liable for tortious acts of independent contractors, although the principal may be liable for injuries \nresulting from his failure to act in situations in which he was not legally permitted to delegate a duty to \nact. Whenever an agent is acting to further the principal’s business interests, the principal will be held \nvicariously liable for the agent’s intentional torts. What constitutes scope of employment is not easy to \ndetermine; the modern trend is to hold a principal liable for the conduct of an agent if it was foreseeable \nthat the agent might act as he did. \n \nMost states have special rules of vicarious liability for special situations; for example, liability of an \nautomobile owner for use by another. Spouses are not vicariously liable for each other, nor are parents for \nchildren, except for failing to control children known to be dangerous.",

They are aggressively promoted on the Internet: “Joint \nVentures are in, and if you’re not utilizing this strategic weapon, chances are your competition is, or will soon be, \nusing this to their advantage.…possibly against you!” (Scott Allen, “Joint Venturing 101,” About.com \nEntrepreneurs,http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/beyondstartup/a/jointventures.htm).As a risk-avoiding device, \nthe joint venture allows two or more firms to pool their differing expertise so that neither needs to “learn the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n472 \nropes” from the beginning; neither needs the entire capital to start the enterprise. Partnership rules generally \napply, although the relationship of the joint venturers is closer to that of special than general agency as discussed \nin Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". Joint venturers are fiduciaries toward one another. \nAlthough no formality is necessary, the associates will usually sign an agreement. The joint venture need have no \ngroup name, though it may have one. Property may be owned jointly. Profits and losses will be shared, as in a \npartnership, and each associate has the right to participate in management. Liability is unlimited. Sometimes two \nor more businesses will form a joint venture to carry out a specific task—prospecting for oil, building a nuclear \nreactor, doing basic scientific research—and will incorporate the joint venture. In that case, the resulting \nbusiness—known as a “joint venture corporation”—is governed by corporation law, not the law of partnership, \nand is not a joint venture in the sense described here. Increasingly, companies are forming joint ventures to do \nbusiness abroad; foreign investors or governments own significant interests in these joint ventures. For example, \nin 1984 General Motors entered into a joint venture with Toyota to revive GM’s shuttered Fremont, California, \nassembly plant to create New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). For GM the joint venture was an \nopportunity to learn about lean manufacturing from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first \nmanufacturing base in North America and a chance to test its production system in an American labor \nenvironment. Until May 2010, when the copartnership ended and the plant closed, NUMMI built an average of six \nthousand vehicles a week, or nearly eight million cars and trucks. These vehicles were the Chevrolet Nova (1984–\n88), the Geo Prizm (1989–97), the Chevrolet Prizm (1998–2002), and the Hilux (1991–95, predecessor of the \nTacoma), as well as the Toyota Voltz, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Pontiac Vibe. The latter two \nwere based on the Toyota Matrix.

Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important.

For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable. For example, if \nCreditor gets a charging order against Paul Partner and the obligation cannot reasonably be paid by the \nfirm, a court could order dissolution so Creditor would get paid from the liquidated assets of the firm. \n \nEffect of Dissolution \nA partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. The partnership \nis terminated when the winding up of its business is completed. [19] However, before winding up is \ncompleted, the partners—except any wrongfully dissociating—may agree to carry on the partnership, in \nwhich case it resumes business as if dissolution never happened. [20] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n520 \n \nContinuing after Dissociation \nDissociation, again, does not necessarily cause dissolution. In an at-will partnership, the death (including \ntermination of an entity partner), bankruptcy, incapacity, or expulsion of a partner will not cause \ndissolution. [21] In a term partnership, the firm continues if, within ninety days of an event triggering \ndissociation, fewer than half the partners express their will to wind up. The partnership agreement may \nprovide that RUPA’s dissolution-triggering events, including dissociation, will not trigger dissolution. \nHowever, the agreement cannot change the rules that dissolution is caused by the business becoming \nillegal or by court order. Creditors of the partnership remain as before, and the dissociated partner is \nliable for partnership obligations arising before dissociation. \n \nSection 701 of RUPA provides that if the firm continues in business after a partner dissociates, without \nwinding up, then the partnership must purchase the dissociated partner’s interest; RUPA Section 701(b) \nexplains how to determine the buyout price. It is the amount that would have been distributed to the \ndissociated partner if, on the date of dissociation, the firm’s assets were sold “at a price equal to the \ngreater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern,” \nminus damages for wrongful dissociation. A wrongful dissociater may have to wait a while to get paid in \nfull, unless a court determines that immediate payment “will not cause an undue hardship to the \npartnership,” but the longest nonwrongful dissociaters need to wait is 120 days. [22] A dissociated partner \ncan sue the firm to determine the buyout price and the court may assess attorney’s, appraiser’s, and \nexpert’s fees against a party the court finds “acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or in bad faith.”[23] \n \nWinding Up the Partnership under UPA and RUPA \nIf the partners decide not to continue the business upon dissolution, they are obliged to wind up the \nbusiness. The partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business, \nafter which it is terminated. [24]Winding up entails concluding all unfinished business pending at the \ndate of dissolution and payment of all debts. The partners must then settle accounts among themselves in \norder to distribute the remaining assets. At any time after dissolution and before winding up is completed, \nthe partners (except a wrongfully dissociated one) can stop the process and carry on the business. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n521 \n \nUPA and RUPA are not significantly different as to winding up, so they will be discussed together. Two \nissues are discussed here: who can participate in winding up and how the assets of the firm are distributed \non liquidation. \n \nWho Can Participate in Winding Up \nThe partners who have not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership \nbusiness. On application of any partner, a court may for good cause judicially supervise the winding up. [25] \n \nSettlement of Accounts among Partners \nDetermining the priority of liabilities can be problematic. For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and",

In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation. As we explore \nin Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign Corporations, and \nCorporate Dissolution\", corporations are not citizens under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the \nConstitution, so that the states can discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations. And the \ncorporation is not entitled to federal review of state criminal convictions, as are many individuals. \n \nPiercing the Corporate Veil \nGiven the importance of the corporate entity as a veil that limits shareholder liability, it is important to \nnote that in certain circumstances, the courts may reach beyond the wall of protection that divides a \ncorporation from the people or entities that exist behind it. This is known \nas piercing the corporate veil, and it will occur in two instances: (1) when the corporation is used to \ncommit a fraud or an injustice and (2) when the corporation does not act as if it were one. \n \nFraud \nThe Felsenthal Company burned to the ground. Its president, one of the company’s largest creditors and \nalso virtually its sole owner, instigated the fire. The corporation sued the insurance company to recover \nthe amount for which it was insured. According to the court in the Felsenthal case, “The general rule of \nlaw is that the willful burning of property by a stockholder in a corporation is not a defense against the \ncollection of the insurance by the corporation, and…the corporation cannot be prevented from collecting \nthe insurance because its agents willfully set fire to the property without the participation or authority of \nthe corporation or of all of the stockholders of the corporation.” [3] But because the fire was caused by the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n596 \nbeneficial owner of “practically all” the stock, who also “has the absolute management of [the \ncorporation’s] affairs and its property, and is its president,” the court refused to allow the company to \nrecover the insurance money; allowing the company to recover would reward fraud. [4] \n \nFailure to Act as a Corporation \nIn other limited circumstances, individual stockholders may also be found personally liable. Failure to \nfollow corporate formalities, for example, may subject stockholders to personal liability. This is a \nspecial risk that small, especially one-person, corporations run. Particular factors that bring this rule into \nplay include inadequate capitalization, omission of regular meetings, failure to record minutes of \nmeetings, failure to file annual reports, and commingling of corporate and personal assets. Where these \nfactors exist, the courts may look through the corporate veil and pluck out the individual stockholder or \nstockholders to answer for a tort, contract breach, or the like. The classic case is the taxicab operator who \nincorporates several of his cabs separately and services them through still another corporation. If one of \nthe cabs causes an accident, the corporation is usually “judgment proof” because the corporation will have \nfew assets (practically worthless cab, minimum insurance). The courts frequently permit plaintiffs to \nproceed against the common owner on the grounds that the particular corporation was inadequately \nfinanced. \n \nFigure 14.2 The Subsidiary as a Corporate Veil \n \n \nWhen a corporation owns a subsidiary corporation, the question frequently arises whether the subsidiary \nis acting as an independent entity (see Figure 14.2 \"The Subsidiary as a Corporate Veil\"). The Supreme \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n597 \nCourt addressed this question of derivative versus direct liability of the corporate parent vis-à-vis its \nsubsidiary in United States v. Bestfoods, (see Section 14.7.2 \"Piercing the Corporate Veil\"). \n \nOther Types of Personal Liability \nEven when a corporation is formed for a proper purpose and is operated as a corporation, there are \ninstances in which individual shareholders will be personally liable. For example, if a shareholder \ninvolved in company management commits a tort or enters into a contract in a personal capacity, he will \nremain personally liable for the consequences of his actions. In some states, statutes give employees \nspecial rights against shareholders. For example, a New York statute permits employees to recover wages, \nsalaries, and debts owed them by the company from the ten largest shareholders of the corporation. \n(Shareholders of public companies whose stock is traded on a national exchange or over the counter are \nexempt.) Likewise, federal law permits the IRS to recover from the “responsible persons” any withholding \ntaxes collected by a corporation but not actually paid over to the US Treasury. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have some of the legal rights of a natural person.

The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware. In addition, Delaware’s Court of Chancery, \na court of equity, is renowned as a premier business court with a well-established body of corporate law, \nthereby affording a business a certain degree of predictability in judicial decision making. \n \nThe Promoter \nFunctions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n604 \nOnce the state of incorporation has been selected, it is time for promoters, the midwives of the \nenterprise, to go to work. Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business.",

Bestfoods \n113 F.3d 572 (1998) \n \nSOUTER, JUSTICE \n \nThe United States brought this action under §107(a)(2) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) against, among others, respondent CPC International, \nInc., the parent corporation of the defunct Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II), for the costs of cleaning up industrial \nwaste generated by Ott II’s chemical plant. Section 107(a)(2) authorizes suits against, among others, “any \nperson who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.” The trial \nfocused on whether CPC, as a parent corporation, had “owned or operated” Ott II’s plant within the \nmeaning of §107(a)(2). The District Court said that operator liability may attach to a parent corporation \nboth indirectly, when the corporate veil can be pierced under state law, and directly, when the parent has \nexerted power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in, and exercising control over, the \nsubsidiary’s business during a period of hazardous waste disposal. Applying that test, the court held CPC \nliable because CPC had selected Ott II’s board of directors and populated its executive ranks with CPC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n615 \nofficials, and another CPC official had played a significant role in shaping Ott II’s environmental \ncompliance policy. \nThe Sixth Circuit reversed. Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1. When (but only when) the corporate veil may be pierced, a parent corporation may be charged with \nderivative CERCLA liability for its subsidiary’s actions in operating a polluting facility. It is a general \nprinciple of corporate law that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of \nanother corporation’s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. CERCLA does not purport to reject \nthis bedrock principle, and the Government has indeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as \nan owner or an operator under §107(a)(2) simply because its subsidiary owns or operates a polluting \nfacility. But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary \nrelationship as well as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for \nthe corporation’s conduct when, inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish \ncertain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud, on the shareholder’s behalf. CERCLA does not purport to \nrewrite this well-settled rule, either, and against this venerable common-law backdrop, the congressional \nsilence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U.S. 256, 266-267. \nCERCLA’s failure to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership \ndemands application of the rule that, to abrogate a common-law principle, a statute must speak directly to \nthe question addressed by the common law. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n616 \n \n2. A corporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of its \nsubsidiary’s facility may be held directly liable in its own right under §107(a)(2) as an operator of the \nfacility. \n \n(a) Derivative liability aside, CERCLA does not bar a parent corporation from direct liability for its own \nactions. Under the plain language of §107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly \nliable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even if that person is the parent corporation \nof the facility’s owner. Because the statute does not define the term “operate,” however, it is difficult to \ndefine actions sufficient to constitute direct parental “operation.” In the organizational sense obviously \nintended by CERCLA, to “operate” a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or \nconduct the affairs of the facility.

What is the fundamental question presented by the case? \n2. What are the differences between creating a corporation de facto and by estoppel? \n \n \n \n \n14.8 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThe hallmark of the corporate form of business enterprise is limited liability for its owners. Other features \nof corporations are separation of ownership and management, perpetual existence, and easy \ntransferability of interests. In the early years of the common law, corporations were thought to be \ncreatures of sovereign power and could be created only by state grant. But by the late nineteenth century, \ncorporations could be formed by complying with the requirements of general corporation statutes in \nvirtually every state. Today the standard is the Revised Model Business Corporation Act. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n625 \n \nThe corporation, as a legal entity, has many of the usual rights accorded natural persons. The principle of \nlimited liability is broad but not absolute: when the corporation is used to commit a fraud or an injustice \nor when the corporation does not act as if it were one, the courts will pierce the corporate veil and pin \nliability on stockholders. \n \nBesides the usual business corporation, there are other forms, including not-for-profit corporations and \nprofessional corporations. Business corporations are classified into two types: publicly held and closely \nheld corporations. \n \nTo form a corporation, the would-be stockholders must choose the state in which they wish to \nincorporate. The goal of the incorporation process is issuance of a corporate charter. The charter is a \ncontract between the state and the corporation. Although the Constitution prohibits states from impairing \nthe obligation of contracts, states reserve the right to modify corporate charters. \n \nThe corporation is created by the incorporators (or promoters), who raise capital, enter into contracts on \nbehalf of the corporation to be formed, and prepare the articles of incorporation. The promoters are \npersonally liable on the contracts they enter into before the corporation is formed. Incorporators owe a \nfiduciary duty to each other, to investors, and to the corporation. \n \nThe articles of incorporation typically contain a number of features, including the corporate name, \ncorporate purposes, total number of shares and classes into which they are divided, par value, and the \nlike. The name must include one of the following words (or abbreviations): corporation, company, \nincorporated, or limited (Corp., Co., Inc., or Ltd.). The articles of incorporation must be filed with the \nsecretary of state. Once they have been filed, the board of directors named in the articles must adopt \nbylaws, elect officers, and conduct other necessary business. The directors are empowered to alter the \nbylaws, subject to repeal or change by the shareholders. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n626 \nEven if the formal prerequisites to incorporation are lacking, a de facto corporation will be held to have \nbeen formed if (1) a statute exists under which the corporation could have been validly incorporated, (2) \nthe promoters made a bona fide attempt to comply with the statute, and (3) a corporate privilege was \nexercised. Under appropriate circumstances, a corporation will be held to exist by estoppel. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Two young business school graduates, Laverne and Shirley, form a consulting firm.

In this chapter, we look at the methods available to \na corporation for raising funds, focusing on how firms generate large amounts of funds and finance \nlarge projects, such as building a new factory. \n \nOne major method of finance is the sale of stock. A corporation sells shares of stock, often in an \ninitial public offering. In exchange for consideration—usually cash—the purchaser acquires stock in \nthe corporation. This stock may give the owner a share in earnings, the right to transfer the stock, \nand, depending on the size of the corporation and the number of shares, power to exercise control. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n630 \nOther methods of corporate finance include bank financing and bonds. We also discuss some more \nmodern financing methods, such as private equity and venture capital. Additional methods of \ncorporate finance, such as commercial paper (see Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial \nPaper\" and Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\"), are discussed elsewhere in this book. \n \n \n \n \n \n15.1 General Sources of Corporate Funds \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Discuss the main sources for raising corporate funds. \n2. Examine the reinvestment of earnings to finance growth. \n3. Review debt and equity as methods of raising funds. \n4. Consider private equity and venture capital, and compare their utility to other forms of financing. \n \n \nSources \nTo finance growth, any ongoing business must have a source of funds. Apart from bank and trade debt, \nthe principal sources are plowback, debt securities, equity securities, and private equity. \n \nPlowback \nA significant source of new funds that corporations spend on capital projects is earnings. Rather than \npaying out earnings to shareholders, the corporation plows those earnings back into the \nbusiness. Plowback is simply reinvesting earnings in the corporation. It is an attractive source of capital \nbecause it is subject to managerial control. No approval by governmental agencies is necessary for its \nexpenditure, as it is when a company seeks to sell securities, or stocks and bonds. Furthermore, stocks \nand bonds have costs associated with them, such as the interest payments on bonds (discussed in Section \n15.1.3 \"Debt Securities\"), while retaining profits avoids these costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n631 \n \nDebt Securities \nA second source of funds is borrowing through debt securities. A corporation may take out a debt security \nsuch as a loan, commonly evidenced by a note and providing security to the lender. This is covered \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual \nLiens\". A common type of corporate debt security is a bond, which is a promise to repay the face value of \nthe bond at maturity and make periodic interest payments called the coupon rate. For example, a bond \nmay have a face value of $1,000 (the amount to be repaid at maturity) and a coupon rate of 7 percent paid \nannually; the corporation pays $70 interest on such a bond each year. Bondholders have priority over \nstockholders because a bond is a debt, and in the event of bankruptcy, creditors have priority over equity \nholders. \n \nEquity Securities \nThe third source of new capital funds is equity securities—namely, stock. Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business. Stock is the smallest source of new capital but is of critical importance to the \ncorporation in launching the business and its initial operations. Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration. Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do",

Review the advantages and disadvantages to the corporation of issuing bonds. \n \n \nBasics of Corporate Bonds \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n634 \nCorporations often raise money through debt. This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration. There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. In \nbankruptcy, the bondholders have a liquidation preference over investors with ownership—that is, the \nshareholders. Additionally, being highly leveraged can be risky: a corporation could load itself up with too \nmuch debt and not be able to make its interest payments or face-value payments. Another major \nconsideration is the “cost” of debt. When interest rates are high, corporations must offer higher interest \nrates to attract investors. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations often raise capital and finance operations through debt. Bank loans are one source of debt, but \nlarge corporations often turn to bonds for financing. Bonds are an IOU, whereby the corporation sells a bond \nto an investor; agrees to make periodic interest payments, such as 5 percent of the face value of the bond \nannually; and at the maturity date, pays the face value of the bond to the investor. There are several \nadvantages to the corporation in using bonds as a financial instrument: the corporation does not give up \nownership in the firm, it attracts more investors, it increases its flexibility, and it can deduct the interest \npayments from corporate taxes. Bonds do have some disadvantages: they are debt and can hurt a highly \nleveraged company, the corporation must pay the interest and principal when they are due, and the \nbondholders have a preference over shareholders upon liquidation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders. A corporation may pay dividends \nthrough a variety of methods, although money and additional shares are the most common. Corporations may \nincrease or decrease the total number of shares through either a stock split or a reverse stock split. A \ncorporation may decide to pay dividends but is not required to do so and cannot issue dividends if the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n652 \ncorporation is insolvent.

Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3. The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670 \nSuppose an incorporated luncheon club refuses to admit women as club members or guests. What \nhappens if this action is ultra vires? Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. (see Section 16.5.1 \"Ultra Vires \nActs\"), focuses on this issue. An ultra vires act is not necessarily criminal or tortious. However, every \ncrime and tort is in some sense ultra vires because a corporation never has legal authority to commit \ncrimes or torts. They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent. An additional dilemma was that society could not \nliterally imprison a corporation. Modern law is not so constricting. Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions. But these \ncases are extremely rare. \n \nThat a corporation is found guilty of a violation of the law does not excuse company officials who \nauthorized or carried out the illegal act. They, too, can be prosecuted and sent to jail. Legal punishments \nare being routinely added to the newer regulatory statutes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and the Toxic Substances Control Act—although prosecution depends mainly on whether and where a \nparticular administration wishes to spend its enforcement dollars. Additionally, state prosecuting \nattorneys have become more active in filing criminal charges against management when employees are \ninjured or die on the job. For instance, a trial court judge in Chicago sentenced a company president, \nplant manager, and foreman to twenty-five years in prison after they were convicted of murder following \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n671 \nthe death of a worker as a result of unsafe working conditions at a plant; [3] the punishments were later \noverturned, but the three pled guilty several years later and served shorter sentences of varying duration. \n \nMore recently, prosecutors have been expanding their prosecutions of corporations and developing \nmethodologies to evaluate whether a corporation has committed a criminal act; for example, US Deputy \nAttorney General Paul McNulty revised “Principles of Federal Prosecutions of Business Organizations” in \n2006 to further guide prosecutors in indicting corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\"). [4] This stands in contrast to the general rule that an individual must \nknow, or should know, of a violation of the law in order to be liable. Strict liability does not require",

(The candidates from the \ntwo slates are not matched against each other on a one-to-one basis; instead, the five candidates with the \nhighest number of votes are elected.) Various formulas and computer programs are available to determine \nhow votes should be allocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting is \ndemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock—Bob and Carol—to elect 40 \npercent of the board. \n \nRMBCA Section 8.08 provides a safeguard against attempts to remove directors. Ordinarily, a director \nmay be removed by a majority vote of the shareholders. Cumulative voting will not aid a given single \ndirector whose ouster is being sought because the majority obviously can win on a straight vote. So \nSection 8.08 provides, “If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of \nvotes sufficient to elect him under cumulative voting is voted against his removal.” \n \nVoting Arrangements to Concentrate Power \nShareholders use three types of arrangements to concentrate their power: proxies, voting agreements, and \nvoting trusts. \n \nProxies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n676 \nA proxy is the representative of the shareholder. A proxy may be a person who stands in for the \nshareholder or may be a written instrument by which the shareholder casts her votes before the \nshareholder meeting. Modern proxy voting allows shareholders to vote electronically through the \nInternet, such as at http://www.proxyvoting.com. Proxies are usually solicited by and given to \nmanagement, either to vote for proposals or people named in the proxy or to vote however the proxy \nholder wishes. Through the proxy device, management of large companies can maintain control over the \nelection of directors. Proxies must be signed by the shareholder and are valid for eleven months from the \ntime they are received by the corporation unless the proxy explicitly states otherwise. Management may \nuse reasonable corporate funds to solicit proxies if corporate policy issues are involved, but \nmisrepresentations in the solicitation can lead a court to nullify the proxies and to deny reimbursement \nfor the solicitation cost. Only the last proxy given by a particular shareholder can be counted. \n \nProxy solicitations are regulated by the SEC. For instance, SEC rules require companies subject to the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to file proxy materials with the SEC at least ten days before proxies are \nmailed to shareholders. Proxy statements must disclose all material facts, and companies must use a \nproxy form on which shareholders can indicate whether they approve or disapprove of the proposals. \n \nDissident groups opposed to management’s position are entitled to solicit their own proxies at their own \nexpense. The company must either furnish the dissidents with a list of all shareholders and addresses or \nmail the proxies at corporate expense. Since management usually prefers to keep the shareholder list \nprivate, dissidents can frequently count on the corporation to foot the mailing bill. \n \nVoting Agreements \nUnless they intend to commit fraud on a minority of stockholders, shareholders may agree in advance to \nvote in specific ways. Such a voting agreement, often called a shareholder agreement, is generally legal. \nShareholders may agree in advance, for example, to vote for specific directors; they can even agree to vote \nfor the dissolution of the corporation in the event that a predetermined contingency occurs. A voting \nagreement is easier to enter into than a voting trust (discussed next) and can be less expensive, since a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n677 \ntrustee is not paid to administer a voting agreement. A voting agreement also permits shareholders to \nretain their shares rather than turning the shares over to a trust, as would be required in a voting trust. \n \nVoting Trusts \nTo ensure that shareholder agreements will be honored, shareholders in most states can create \na voting trust. By this device, voting shares are given to voting trustees, who are empowered to vote the \nshares in accordance with the objectives set out in the trust agreement. Section 7.30 of the RMBCA limits \nthe duration of voting trusts to ten years. The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust. The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting",

In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the \ncorporation. The rule encompasses the chance of acquiring another corporation, purchasing property, and \nlicensing or marketing patents or products. This duty of disclosure was placed into legal lexicon by Judge \nCardozo in 1928 when he stated that business partners owe more than a general sense of honor among \none another; rather, they owe “the punctilio of honor most sensitive.” [3] Thus when a corporate \nopportunity arises, business partners must disclose the opportunity, and a failure to disclose is \ndishonest—a breach of the duty of loyalty. \n \nWhether a particular opportunity is a corporate opportunity can be a delicate question. For example, BCT \nowns a golf course and a country club. A parcel of land adjacent to their course comes on the market for \nsale, but BCT takes no action. Two BCT officers purchase the land personally, later informing the BCT \nboard about the purchase and receiving board ratification of their purchase. Then BCT decides to \nliquidate and enters into an agreement with the two officers to sell both parcels of land. A BCT \nshareholder brings a derivative suit against the officers, alleging that purchasing the adjacent land stole a \ncorporate opportunity. The shareholder would be successful in his suit. In considering Farber v. Servan \nLand Co., Inc., [4] a case just like the one described, the Farber court laid out four factors in considering \nwhether a corporate opportunity has been usurped: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n687 \n1. Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand. Put another way, a director must make a reasonable \neffort to inform himself before making a decision, as discussed in the next paragraph. The director is not \nheld to a higher standard required of a specialist (finance, marketing) unless he is one. A director of a \nsmall, closely held corporation will not necessarily be held to the same standard as a director who is given \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n688 \na staff by a large, complex, diversified company. The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations",

Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation. Other groups—\nemployees, local communities and neighbors, customers, suppliers, and creditors—took a back seat to this \nprimary responsibility of directors. Of course, directors could consider the welfare of these other groups if \nin so doing they promoted the interests of shareholders. But directors were not legally permitted to favor \nthe interests of others over shareholders. The prevailing rule was, and often still is, that maximizing \nshareholder value is the primary duty of the board. Thus in Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes \nHoldings, Inc., [16] the Delaware Supreme Court held that Revlon’s directors had breached their fiduciary \nduty to the company’s shareholders in response to a hostile tender offer from Pantry Pride. While the facts \nof the case are intricate, the general gist is that the Revlon directors thwarted the hostile tender by \nadopting a variation of a poison pill involving a tender offer for their own shares in exchange for debt, \neffectively eliminating Pantry Pride’s ability to take over the firm. Pantry Pride upped its offer price, and \nin response, Revlon began negotiating with a leveraged buyout by a third party, Forstmann Little. Pantry \nPride publicly announced it would top any bid made by Forstmann Little. Despite this, the Revlon board \nnegotiated a deal with Forstmann Little. The court noted an exception to the general rule that permitted \ndirectors to consider the interests of other groups as long as “there are rationally related benefits accruing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n692 \nto the stockholders.” But when a company is about to be taken over, the object must be to sell it to the \nhighest bidder, Pantry Pride in this case. It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits. This ability has been \nfurther expanding as the concept of corporate social responsibility has grown, as discussed later in this \nsection. \n \nAlthough the other constituency statutes are not identically worded, they are all designed to release \ndirectors from their formal legal obligation to keep paramount the interests of shareholders. The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy. So \nbroadly worded are these laws that although the motive for enacting them was to give directors a weapon \nin fighting hostile tender offers, in some states the principle applies to any decision by a board of \ndirectors. So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies.

While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in \nthe context of mergers, acquisitions, and tender offers. As mentioned previously in the Revlon case, the \nduty owed to shareholders in situations of competing tender offers is that of maximum value. Other duties \nmay arise, such as when directors attempt to retain their positions on the board in the face of a hostile \ntender offer. Trends in fiduciary responsibilities, as well as other changes in the business legal field, are \ncovered extensively by the American Bar Association \nat http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html. \n \nLiability Prevention and Insurance \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n695 \nAlice, the director of BCT, has been charged with breaching her duty of care. Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law. Delaware Code Section 102(b)(7), as mentioned previously, was \nenacted after Smith v. Van Gorkom (discussed in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\") and was prompted by an",

The plaintiff appealed.] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n702 \nWe next turn to the claims of error that relate to the Disney defendants. Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination. We address separately those two categories and the issues that \nthey generate.… \n \n…[The due care] argument is best understood against the backdrop of the presumptions that cloak \ndirector action being reviewed under the business judgment standard. Our law presumes that “in making \na business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the \nhonest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Those presumptions can be \nrebutted if the plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted \nin bad faith. If that is shown, the burden then shifts to the director defendants to demonstrate that the \nchallenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders.… \n \nThe appellants’ first claim is that the Chancellor erroneously (i) failed to make a “threshold \ndetermination” of gross negligence, and (ii) “conflated” the appellants’ burden to rebut the business \njudgment presumptions, with an analysis of whether the directors’ conduct fell within the 8 Del. C. § \n102(b)(7) provision that precludes exculpation of directors from monetary liability “for acts or omissions \nnot in good faith.” The argument runs as follows: Emerald Partners v. Berlin required the Chancellor first \nto determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted based upon a showing that \nthe board violated its duty of care, i.e., acted with gross negligence. If gross negligence were established, \nthe burden would shift to the directors to establish that the OEA was entirely fair. Only if the directors \nfailed to meet that burden could the trial court then address the directors’ Section 102(b)(7) exculpation \ndefense, including the statutory exception for acts not in good faith. \n \nThis argument lacks merit. To make the argument the appellants must ignore the distinction between (i) a \ndetermination of bad faith for the threshold purpose of rebutting the business judgment rule \npresumptions, and (ii) a bad faith determination for purposes of evaluating the availability of charter-\nauthorized exculpation from monetary damage liability after liability has been established. Our law clearly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n703 \npermits a judicial assessment of director good faith for that former purpose. Nothing in Emerald \nPartners requires the Court of Chancery to consider only evidence of lack of due care (i.e. gross \nnegligence) in determining whether the business judgment rule presumptions have been rebutted.… \n \nThe appellants argue that the Disney directors breached their duty of care by failing to inform themselves \nof all material information reasonably available with respect to Ovitz’s employment agreement.…[but the] \nonly properly reviewable action of the entire board was its decision to elect Ovitz as Disney’s President. In \nthat context the sole issue, as the Chancellor properly held, is “whether [the remaining members of the old \nboard] properly exercised their business judgment and acted in accordance with their fiduciary duties \nwhen they elected Ovitz to the Company’s presidency.” The Chancellor determined that in electing Ovitz, \nthe directors were informed of all information reasonably available and, thus, were not grossly negligent. \nWe agree. \n \n…[The court turns to good faith.] The Court of Chancery held that the business judgment rule \npresumptions protected the decisions of the compensation committee and the remaining Disney \ndirectors, not only because they had acted with due care but also because they had not acted in bad faith. \nThat latter ruling, the appellants claim, was reversible error because the Chancellor formulated and then \napplied an incorrect definition of bad faith. \n \n…Their argument runs as follows: under the Chancellor’s 2003 definition of bad faith, the directors must \nhave “consciously and intentionally disregarded their responsibilities, adopting a ‘we don’t care about \nthe risks’ attitude concerning a material corporate decision.” Under the 2003 formulation, appellants say, \n“directors violate their duty of good faith if they are making material decisions without adequate \ninformation and without adequate deliberation[,]” but under the 2005 post-trial definition, bad faith \nrequires proof of a subjective bad motive or intent. This definitional change, it is claimed, was \nprocedurally prejudicial because appellants relied on the 2003 definition in presenting their evidence of \nbad faith at the trial.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

It is the business of the marketplace, \nnot the SEC, to determine whether the risk is worth taking. \n \nThe SEC enforces securities laws through two primary federal acts: The Securities Act of 1933 and The \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. \n \nSecurities Act of 1933 \nGoals \nThe Securities Act of 1933 is the fundamental “truth in securities” law. Its two basic objectives, which \nare written in its preamble, are “to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in \ninterstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof.” \n \nRegistration \nThe primary means for realizing these goals is the requirement of registration. Before securities subject to \nthe act can be offered to the public, the issuer must file a registration statement and prospectus with \nthe SEC, laying out in detail relevant and material information about the offering as set forth in various \nschedules to the act. If the SEC approves the registration statement, the issuer must then provide any \nprospective purchaser with the prospectus. Since the SEC does not pass on the fairness of price or other \nterms of the offering, it is unlawful to state or imply in the prospectus that the commission has the power \nto disapprove securities for lack of merit, thereby suggesting that the offering is meritorious. \n \nThe SEC has prepared special forms for registering different types of issuing companies. All call for a \ndescription of the registrant’s business and properties and of the significant provisions of the security to \nbe offered, facts about how the issuing company is managed, and detailed financial statements certified by \nindependent public accountants. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n719 \nOnce filed, the registration and prospectus become public and are open for public inspection. Ordinarily, \nthe effective date of the registration statement is twenty days after filing. Until then, the offering may not \nbe made to the public. Section 2(10) of the act defines prospectus as any “notice, circular, advertisement, \nletter, or communication, written or by radio or television, which offers any security for sale or confirms \nthe sale of any security.” (An exception: brief notes advising the public of the availability of the formal \nprospectus.) The import of this definition is that any communication to the public about the offering of a \nsecurity is unlawful unless it contains the requisite information. \n \nThe SEC staff examines the registration statement and prospectus, and if they appear to be materially \nincomplete or inaccurate, the commission may suspend or refuse the effectiveness of the registration \nstatement until the deficiencies are corrected. Even after the securities have gone on sale, the agency has \nthe power to issue a stop order that halts trading in the stock. \n \nSection 5(c) of the act bars any person from making any sale of any security unless it is first registered. \nNevertheless, there are certain classes of exemptions from the registration requirement. Perhaps the most \nimportant of these is Section 4(3), which exempts “transactions by any person other than an issuer, \nunderwriter or dealer.” Section 4(3) also exempts most transactions of dealers. So the net is that trading \nin outstanding securities (the secondary market) is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of \n1933: you need not file a registration statement with the SEC every time you buy or sell securities through \na broker or dealer, for example. Other exemptions include the following: (1) private offerings to a limited \nnumber of persons or institutions who have access to the kind of information registration would disclose",

Today, every state has enacted a blue sky law, so called because its purpose is to \nprevent “speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of ‘blue sky.’” [3] The federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n722 \nSecurities Act of 1933, discussed in Section 17.1.3 \"Securities Act of 1933\", specifically preserves the \njurisdiction of states over securities. \nBlue sky laws are divided into three basic types of regulation. The simplest is that which prohibits fraud in \nthe sale of securities. Thus at a minimum, issuers cannot mislead investors about the purpose of the \ninvestment. All blue sky laws have antifraud provisions; some have no other provisions. The second type \ncalls for registration of broker-dealers, and the third type for registration of securities. Some state laws \nparallel the federal laws in intent and form of proceeding, so that they overlap; other blue sky laws \nempower state officials (unlike the SEC) to judge the merits of the offerings, often referred to as \nmerit review laws. As part of a movement toward deregulation, several states have recently modified or \neliminated merit provisions. \n \nMany of the blue sky laws are inconsistent with each other, making national uniformity difficult. In 1956, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Securities Act. \nIt has not been designed to reconcile the conflicting philosophies of state regulation but to take them into \naccount and to make the various forms of regulation as consistent as possible. States adopt various \nportions of the law, depending on their regulatory philosophies. The Uniform Securities Act has antifraud, \nbroker-dealer registration, and securities registration provisions. More recent acts have further increased \nuniformity. These include the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which preempted \ndiffering state philosophies with regard to registration of securities and regulation of brokers and \nadvisors, and the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which preempted state law \nsecurities fraud claims from being raised in class action lawsuits by investors. \n \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich is the largest amendment to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. \nThis amendment was enacted in response to the economic recession of the late 2000s for the following \npurposes: (1) to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and \ntransparency in the financial system, (2) to end “too big to fail” institutions, (3) to protect the American \ntaxpayer by ending bailouts, and (4) to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n723 \ninstitutions most affected by the regulatory changes include those involved in monitoring the financial \nsystem, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the SEC. Importantly, the \namendment ended the exemption for investment advisors who previously were not required to register \nwith the SEC because they had fewer than fifteen clients during the previous twelve months and did not \nhold out to the public as investment advisors. This means that in practice, numerous investment advisors, \nas well as hedge funds and private equity firms, are now subject to registration requirements.

It is not limited to securities \nregistered under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. It is not limited to publicly held companies. It applies \nto any security issued by any company, including the smallest closely held company. In substance, it is an \nantifraud rule, enforcement of which seems, on its face, to be limited to action by the SEC. But over the \nyears, the courts have permitted people injured by those who violate the statute to file private damage \nsuits. This sweeping rule has at times been referred to as the “federal law of corporations” or the “catch \neverybody” rule. \n \nInsider trading ran headlong into Rule 10b-5 beginning in 1964 in a series of cases involving Texas Gulf \nSulphur Company (TGS). On November 12, 1963, the company discovered a rich deposit of copper and \nzinc while drilling for oil near Timmins, Ontario. Keeping the discovery quiet, it proceeded to acquire \nmineral rights in adjacent lands. By April 1964, word began to circulate about TGS’s find. \n \nNewspapers printed rumors, and the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced a wild speculative spree. On \nApril 12, an executive vice president of TGS issued a press release downplaying the discovery, asserting \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n728 \nthat the rumors greatly exaggerated the find and stating that more drilling would be necessary before \ncoming to any conclusions. Four days later, on April 16, TGS publicly announced that it had uncovered a \nstrike of 25 million tons of ore. In the months following this announcement, TGS stock doubled in value. \n \nThe SEC charged several TGS officers and directors with having purchased or told their friends, so-\ncalled tippees, to purchase TGS stock from November 12, 1963, through April 16, 1964, on the basis of \nmaterial inside information. The SEC also alleged that the April 12, 1964, press release was deceptive. The \nUS Court of Appeals, in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., [2] decided that the defendants who purchased the \nstock before the public announcement had violated Rule 10b-5. According to the court, “anyone in \npossession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is \ndisabled from disclosing to protect a corporate confidence, or he chooses not to do so, must abstain from \ntrading in or recommending the securities concerned while such inside information remains undisclosed.” \nOn remand, the district court ordered certain defendants to pay $148,000 into an escrow account to be \nused to compensate parties injured by the insider trading. \n \nThe court of appeals also concluded that the press release violated Rule 10b-5 if “misleading to the \nreasonable investor.” On remand, the district court held that TGS failed to exercise “due diligence” in \nissuing the release. Sixty-nine private damage actions were subsequently filed against TGS by \nshareholders who claimed they sold their stock in reliance on the release. The company settled most of \nthese suits in late 1971 for $2.7 million. \n \nFollowing the TGS episode, the Supreme Court refined Rule 10b-5 on several fronts. First, in Ernst & \nErnst v. Hochfelder, [3] the Court decided that proof of scienter—defined as “mental state embracing \nintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”—is required in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In \nother words, negligence alone will not result in Rule 10b-5 liability. The Court also held that scienter, \nwhich is an intentional act, must be established in SEC injunctive actions. [4] \n \nThe Supreme Court has placed limitations on the liability of tippees under Rule 10b-5. In 1980, the Court \nreversed the conviction of an employee of a company that printed tender offer and merger prospectuses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n729 \nUsing information obtained at work, the employee had purchased stock in target companies and later sold \nit for a profit when takeover attempts were publicly announced. In Chiarella v. United States, the Court \nheld that the employee was not an insider or a fiduciary and that “a duty to disclose under Section 10(b) \ndoes not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.” [5] Following Chiarella, the \nCourt ruled in Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission (see Section 17.3.2 \"Tippee Liability\"), that \ntippees are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing \nconfidential information and the tipper received a personal benefit from the disclosure. \n \nThe Supreme Court has also refined Rule 10b-5 as it relates to the duty of a company to \ndisclose material information, as discussed in Basic, Inc. v.

The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company.

As with mergers, the boards and shareholders must approve the consolidation by \nmajority votes (see Figure 18.3 \"Consolidation\"). The resulting corporation becomes effective when the \nsecretary of state issues a certificate of merger or incorporation. \n \nFigure 18.3Consolidation \n \n \nFor more information on mergers and consolidation under Delaware law, see Del. Code Ann., Title 8, \nSections 251–267 (2011), at http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/index.shtml#TopOfPage. \n \nPurchase of Stock \nTakeovers \nThe fourth method of expanding, purchase of a company’s stock, is more complicated than the other \nmethods. The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt. A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target. The purchasers also use other types of debt, such as the issuance of bonds or a loan, \nto implement the LBO. \n \nFor more information about tender offers and mergers, see Unocal v. Mesa [3]and Revlon v. MacAndrews \n& Forbes. [4] The Wall Street Journal provides comprehensive coverage of tender offers, mergers, and \nLBOs, athttp://www.wsj.com. \n \nState versus Federal Regulation of Takeovers \nUnder the federal Williams Act, upon commencement of a tender offer for more than 5 percent of the \ntarget’s stock, the offeror must file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nstating the source of funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent \nof its holdings in the target company. Even when a tender offer has not been made, the Williams Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n752 \nrequires any person who acquires more than 5 percent ownership of a corporation to file a statement with \nthe SEC within ten days. The Williams Act, which made certain amendments to the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934, can be viewed at http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/. The US Constitution is also implicated \nin the regulation of foreign corporations. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect.

The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana second-\ngeneration statute that prevents an offeror who has acquired 20 percent or more of a target’s stock from \nvoting unless other shareholders (not including management) approve. The vote to approve can be \ndelayed for up to fifty days from the date the offeror files a statement reporting the acquisition. The Court \nconcluded that the Commerce Clause was not violated nor was the Williams Act, because the Indiana law, \nunlike the Illinois law in Mite, was consistent with the Williams Act, since it protects shareholders, does \nnot unreasonably delay the tender offer, and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. [6] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n753 \nEmboldened by the CTS decision, almost half the states have adopted a third-generation law that requires \na bidder to wait several years before merging with the target company unless the target’s board agrees in \nadvance to the merger. Because in many cases a merger is the reason for the bid, these laws are especially \npowerful. In 1989, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wisconsin’s third-generation law, saying \nthat it did not violate the Commerce Clause and that it was not preempted by the Williams Act. The \nSupreme Court decided not to review the decision. [7] \n \nShort-Form Mergers \nIf one company acquires 90 percent or more of the stock of another company, it can merge with the target \ncompany through the so-called short-form merger. Only the parent company’s board of directors need \napprove the merger; consent of the shareholders of either company is unnecessary. \n \nAppraisal Rights \nIf a shareholder has the right to vote on a corporate plan to merge, consolidate, or sell all or substantially \nall of its assets, that shareholder has the right to dissent and invoke appraisal rights. Returning again to \nBCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the \nwisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying \nTruckman. The law requires the shareholder to file with the corporation, before the vote, a notice of \nintention to demand the fair value of his shares. If the plan is approved and the shareholder does not vote \nin favor, the corporation must send a notice to the shareholder specifying procedures for obtaining \npayment, and the shareholder must demand payment within the time set in the notice, which cannot be \nless than thirty days. Fair value means the value of shares immediately before the effective date of the \ncorporate action to which the shareholder has objected. Appreciation and depreciation in anticipation of \nthe action are excluded, unless the exclusion is unfair. \n \nIf the shareholder and the company cannot agree on the fair value, the shareholder must file a petition \nrequesting a court to determine the fair value. The method of determining fair value depends on the \ncircumstances. When there is a public market for stock traded on an exchange, fair value is usually the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n754 \nprice quoted on the exchange. In some circumstances, other factors, especially net asset value and \ninvestment value—for example, earnings potential—assume greater importance. \n \nSee Hariton v. Arco Electronics, Inc.

Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts. [2] \n \nTypical Requirements for Foreign Corporations \nCertain preconditions for doing business are common to most states. Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however. The state attorney general has authority to collect \ncivil penalties that vary from state to state. Other sanctions in various states include fines and penalties on \ntaxes owed; fines and imprisonment of corporate agents, directors, and officers; nullification of corporate \ncontracts; and personal liability on contracts by officers and directors. In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court \nupheld the validity of long-arm statutes applied to corporations in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington. [3] But the long-arm statute will only be constitutionally valid where there are minimum \ncontacts—that is, for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, the foreign \ncorporation must have at least “minimum contacts” the state. That jurisdictional test is still applied many \nyears after the International Shoe decision was handed down. [4] Since International Shoe, the \nnationalization of commerce has given way to the internationalization of commerce. This change has \nresulted in difficult jurisdictional questions that involve conflicting policy considerations.

Since a state may obviously tax its domestic corporations, the \nquestion might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause.

Not even the sequestration of \nthe assets at the hands of a receiver will terminate its being.” [1] \n \nSee http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98703,00.html for the Internal Revenue Service’s \nchecklist of closing and dissolving a business. State and local government regulations may also apply. \n \nVoluntary Dissolution \nAny corporation may be dissolved with the unanimous written consent of the shareholders; this is \na voluntary dissolution. This provision is obviously applicable primarily to closely held corporations. \nDissolution can also be accomplished even if some shareholders dissent. The directors must first adopt a \nresolution by majority vote recommending the dissolution. The shareholders must then have an \nopportunity to vote on the resolution at a meeting after being notified of its purpose. A majority of the \noutstanding voting shares is necessary to carry the resolution. Although this procedure is most often used \nwhen a company has been inactive, nothing bars its use by large corporations. In 1979, UV Industries, \n357th on the Fortune 500 list, with profits of $40 million annually, voted to dissolve and to distribute \nsome $500 million to its stockholders, in part as a means of fending off a hostile takeover. Fortune \nmagazine referred to it as “a company that’s worth more dead than alive.” [2] \n \nOnce dissolution has been approved, the corporation may dissolve by filing a certificate or articles of \ndissolution with the secretary of state. The certificate may be filed as the corporation begins to wind up its \naffairs or at any time thereafter. The process of winding up is liquidation. The company must notify all \ncreditors of its intention to liquidate. It must collect and dispose of its assets, discharge all obligations, \nand distribute any remainder to its stockholders. \n \nInvoluntary Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n761 \nIn certain cases, a corporation can face involuntary dissolution. A state may bring an action to \ndissolve a corporation on one of five grounds: failure to file an annual report or pay taxes, fraud in \nprocuring incorporation, exceeding or abusing authority conferred, failure for thirty days to appoint and \nmaintain a registered agent, and failure to notify the state of a change of registered office or agent. State-\nspecific differences exist as well. Delaware permits its attorney general to involuntarily dissolve a \ncorporation for abuse, misuse, or nonuse of corporate powers, privileges, or franchise. [3] California, on the \nother hand, permits involuntary dissolution for abandonment of a business, board deadlocks, internal \nstrife and deadlocked shareholders, mismanagement, fraud or abuse of authority, expiration of term of \ncorporation, or protection of a complaining shareholder if there are fewer than thirty-five \nshareholders. [4]California permits the initiation of involuntary dissolution by either half of the directors in \noffice or by a third of shareholders. \n \nJudicial Liquidation \nAction by Shareholder \nA shareholder may file suit to have a court dissolve the company on a showing that the company is being \nirreparably injured because the directors are deadlocked in the management of corporate affairs and the \nshareholders cannot break the deadlock. Shareholders may also sue for liquidation if corporate assets are \nbeing misapplied or wasted, or if directors or those in control are acting illegally, oppressively, or \nfraudulently. \n \nClaims against a Dissolved Corporation \nUnder Sections 14.06 and 14.07 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act, a dissolved corporation \nmust provide written notice of the dissolution to its creditors. The notice must state a deadline, which \nmust be at least 120 days after the notice, for receipt of creditors’ claims. Claims not received by the \ndeadline are barred. The corporation may also publish a notice of the dissolution in a local newspaper. \nCreditors who do not receive written notice or whose claim is not acted on have five years to file suit \nagainst the corporation. If the corporate assets have been distributed, shareholders are personally liable, \nalthough the liability may not exceed the assets received at liquidation. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n762 \nBankruptcy \nAs an alternative to dissolution, a corporation in financial trouble may look to federal bankruptcy law for \nrelief.

Rptr. 574 (Cal. 1977) \n \nClaiming damages for injury from a defective ladder, plaintiff asserts strict tort liability against defendant \nAlad Corporation (Alad II) which neither manufactured nor sold the ladder but prior to plaintiff’s injury \nsucceeded to the business of the ladder’s manufacturer, the now dissolved “Alad Corporation” (Alad I), \nthrough a purchase of Alad I’s assets for an adequate cash consideration. Upon acquiring Alad I’s plant, \nequipment, inventory, trade name, and good will, Alad II continued to manufacture the same line of \nladders under the “Alad” name, using the same equipment, designs, and personnel, and soliciting Alad I’s \ncustomers through the same sales representatives with no outward indication of any change in the \nownership of the business. The trial court entered summary judgment for Alad II and plaintiff appeals.… \n \nOur discussion of the law starts with the rule ordinarily applied to the determination of whether a \ncorporation purchasing the principal assets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities. As \ntypically formulated, the rule states that the purchaser does not assume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) \nthere is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n764 \nmerger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) \nthe transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller’s \ndebts. \n \nIf this rule were determinative of Alad II’s liability to plaintiff it would require us to affirm the summary \njudgment. None of the rule’s four stated grounds for imposing liability on the purchasing corporation is \npresent here. There was no express or implied agreement to assume liability for injury from defective \nproducts previously manufactured by Alad I. Nor is there any indication or contention that the transaction \nwas prompted by any fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for Alad I’s debts. \n \nWith respect to the second stated ground for liability, the purchase of Alad I’s assets did not amount to a \nconsolidation or merger. This exception has been invoked where one corporation takes all of another’s \nassets without providing any consideration that could be made available to meet claims of the other’s \ncreditors or where the consideration consists wholly of shares of the purchaser’s stock which are promptly \ndistributed to the seller’s shareholders in conjunction with the seller’s liquidation. In the present case the \nsole consideration given for Alad I’s assets was cash in excess of $ 207,000. Of this amount Alad I was \npaid $ 70,000 when the assets were transferred and at the same time a promissory note was given to Alad \nI for almost $ 114,000. Shortly before the dissolution of Alad I the note was assigned to the Hamblys, Alad \nI’s principal stockholders, and thereafter the note was paid in full. The remainder of the consideration \nwent for closing expenses or was paid to the Hamblys for consulting services and their agreement not to \ncompete. There is no contention that this consideration was inadequate or that the cash and promissory \nnote given to Alad I were not included in the assets available to meet claims of Alad I’s creditors at the \ntime of dissolution.

It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786 \nA second type of commercial paper is the common bank check, a special form of draft. Section 3-104(2)(b) \nof the UCC defines a check as “a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand.” Postdating a check \n(putting in a future date) does not invalidate it or change its character as payable on demand. Postdating \nsimply changes the first time at which the payee may demand payment. Checks are, of course, usually \nwritten on paper forms, but a check can be written on anything—a door, a shirt, a rock—though certainly \nthe would-be holder is not obligated to accept it. \n \nLike drafts, checks may be accepted by the drawee bank. Bank acceptance of a check is \ncalled certification; the check is said to be certified by stamping the word “certified” on the face of the \ncheck. When the check is certified, the bank guarantees that it will honor the check when presented. It can \noffer this guarantee because it removes from the drawer’s account the face amount of the check and holds \nit for payment. The payee may demand payment from the bank but not from the drawer or any prior \nindorser of the check. \nA certified check is distinct from a cashier’s check. A cashier’s check is drawn on the account of the \nbank itself and signed by an authorized bank representative in return for a cash payment to it from the \ncustomer. The bank guarantees payment of the cashier’s check also. \n \nNotes \nA note—often called a promissory note—is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money on \ndemand or at a definite time. There are two parties to a note: the maker (promisor), and \nthe payee (promisee). For an example of a promissory note, see Figure 19.4 \"A Promissory Note\". The \nmaker might execute a promissory note in return for a money loan from a bank or other financial \ninstitution or in return for the opportunity to make a purchase on credit. \n \nFigure 19.4 A Promissory Note \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n787 \n \n \nCertificates of Deposit \nA fourth type of commercial paper is the certificate of deposit, commonly called a CD. The CD is a \nwritten acknowledgment by a bank that it has received money and agrees to repay it at a time specified in \nthe certificate. The first negotiable CD was issued in 1961 by First National City Bank of New York (now \nCitibank); it was designed to compete for corporate cash that companies were investing in Treasury notes \nand other funds. Because CDs are negotiable, they can be traded easily if the holder wants cash, though \ntheir price fluctuates with the market. \n \n \nOther Parties to Commercial Paper \nIn addition to makers, drawees, and payees, there are five other capacities in which one can deal with \ncommercial paper. \n \nIndorser and Indorsee \nThe indorser (also spelled endorser) is one who transfers ownership of a negotiable instrument by \nsigning it. A depositor indorses a check when presenting it for deposit by signing it on the back. The bank \ndeposits its own funds, in the amount of the check, to the depositor’s account. By indorsing it, the \ndepositor transfers ownership of the check to the bank. The depositor’s bank then can present it to the \ndrawer’s bank for repayment from the drawer’s funds. The indorsee is the one to whom a draft or note is \nindorsed. When a check is deposited in a bank, the bank is the indorsee. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n788 \nHolder \nA holder is “a person in possession of a negotiable that is payable either to bearer, or to an identified \nperson that is the person in possession.” [2] Holder is thus a generic term that embraces several of the \nspecific types of parties already mentioned. An indorsee and a drawee can be holders. But a holder can \nalso be someone unnamed whom the original parties did not contemplate by name—for example, the \nholder of a bearer note. \n \nHolder in Due Course \nA holder in due course is a special type of holder who, if certain requirements are met, acquires rights \nbeyond those possessed by the transferor (we alluded to this in describing the significance of Lorna Love’s \nmaking of a negotiable—as opposed to a nonnegotiable—instrument). We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to",

It does not matter in what capacity she signs, whether as maker or \ncomaker, drawer or codrawer, or indorser. As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay). The extent of the accommodation party’s liability to pay depends on whether she has \nadded language specifying her purposes in signing. Section 3-416 of the UCC distinguishes between a \nguaranty of payment and a guaranty of collection. An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment. Only if the \njudgment is unsatisfied can the holder seek to collect from the accommodation party. When words of \nguaranty do not specify the type, the law presumes a payment guaranty. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n789 \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe modern law of commercial paper is, in general, covered by UCC Article 3. The two basic types of \ncommercial paper are drafts and notes. The note is a two-party instrument whereby one person (maker) \npromises to pay money to a second person (payee). The draft is a three-party instrument whereby one person \n(drawer) directs a second (drawee) to pay money to the third (payee). Drafts may be sight drafts, payable on \nsight, or they may be time drafts, payable at a date specified on the draft. Checks are drafts drawn on banks. \nOther parties include indorser and indorsee, holder, holder in due course, and accommodation party. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What are the two basic types of commercial paper? \n2. What are the two types of drafts? \n3. What kind of commercial paper is a check? \n \n  \n \n[1] Norton v. Knapp, 19 N.W. 867 (IA 1884). \n[2] Uniform Commercial Code, Section 1-201(21). \n \n \n19.3 Requirements for Negotiability \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Know what is required for an instrument to be negotiable. \n \n \nOverview \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n790 \nWhether or not a paper is negotiable is the first of our four major questions, and it is one that nonlawyers \nmust confront. Auditors, retailers, and financial institutions often handle notes and checks and usually \nmust make snap judgments about negotiability. Unless the required elements of Sections 3-103 and 3-104 \nof the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) are met, the paper is not negotiable. Thus the paper meets the \nfollowing criteria: \n1. It must be in writing. \n2. It must be signed by the maker or drawer. \n3. It must be an unconditional promise or order to pay. \n4. It must be for a fixed amount in money. \n5. It must be payable on demand or at a definite time. \n6. It must be payable to order or bearer, unless it is a check. \n \nThis definition states the basic premise of a negotiable instrument: the holder must be able to ascertain all \nessential terms from the face of the instrument. \nAnalysis of Required Elements \nIn Writing \nUnder UCC Section 1-201, “written” or “writing” includes “printing, typewriting or any other intentional \nreduction to tangible form.” That definition is broad—so broad, in fact, that from time to time the \nnewspapers report checks written on material ranging from a girdle (an Ohio resident wanted to make his \ntax payment stretch) to granite. Since these are tangible materials, the checks meet the writing \nrequirement. The writing can be made in any medium: ink, pencil, or even spray paint, as was the case \nwith the granite check. Of course, there is a danger in using pencil or an ink that can be erased, since the \ndrawer might be liable for alterations. For example, if you write out in pencil a check for $10 and someone \nerases your figures and writes in $250, you may lose your right to protest when the bank cashes it. \n \nSigned by the Maker or Drawer \nSignature is not limited to the personal handwriting of one’s name. “Any symbol executed or adopted by a \nparty with present intention to authenticate a writing” will serve.

[1] That means that a maker or drawer \nmay make an impression of his signature with a rubber stamp or even an X if he intends that by so doing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n791 \nhe has signed. It can be typed or by thumbprint. In some cases, an appropriate letterhead may serve to \nmake the note or draft negotiable without any other signature. Nor does the position of the signature \nmatter. Blackstone Kent’s handwritten note, “Ten days from this note, I, Blackstone Kent, promise to pay \n$5,000 to the order of Webster Mews,” is sufficient to make the note negotiable, even though there is no \nsubsequent signature. Moreover, the signature may be in a trade name or an assumed name. (Note: \nspecial problems arise when an agent signs on behalf of a principal. We consider these problems \nin Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\".) \n \nUnconditional Promise or Order to Pay \nSection 3-106(a) of the UCC provides that an instrument is not negotiable if it “states (i) an express \ncondition to payment, (ii) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) \nthat rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing. A reference to \nanother writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.” Under 3-106(b), a promise is \nnot made conditional by “(i) reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to \ncollateral, pre-payment, or acceleration, or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or \nsource.” As to “reference to another writing,” see Holly Hill Acres, Ltd. v. Charter Bank of Gainesville, \nin Section 19.4 \"Cases\". \n \nThe only permissible promise or order in a negotiable instrument is to pay a sum certain in money. Any \nother promise or order negates negotiability. The reason for this rule is to prevent an instrument from \nhaving an indeterminate value. The usefulness of a negotiable instrument as a substitute for money would \nbe seriously eroded if the instrument’s holder had to investigate whether a stipulation or condition had \nbeen met before the thing had any value (i.e., before the obligor’s obligation to pay ripened). \n \nFixed Amount in Money \nThe value of the paper must be fixed (specific) so it can be ascertained, and it must be payable in money. \n \nFixed Amount \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n792 \nThe instrument must recite an exact amount of money that is to be paid, although the exact amount need \nnot be expressed in a single figure. For example, the note can state that the principal is $1,000 and the \ninterest is 11.5 percent, without specifying the total amount. Or the note could state the amount in \ninstallments: twelve equal installments of $88.25. Or it could state different interest rates before and after \na certain date or depending on whether or not the maker has defaulted; it could be determinable by a \nformula or by reference to a source described in the instrument. [2] It could permit the maker to take a \ndiscount if he pays before a certain date or could assess a penalty if he pays after the date. It could also \nprovide for an attorney’s fees and the costs of collection on default. If it is clear that interest is to be \nincluded but no interest amount is set, UCC Section 3-112 provides that it is “payable at the judgment rate \nin effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.” The fundamental \nrule is that for any time of payment, the holder must be able to determine, after the appropriate \ncalculations, the amount then payable. See Section 19.4 \"Cases\", Centerre Bank of Branson v. Campbell, \nfor a case involving the “fixed amount” rule. \n \nIn Money \nSection 1-201(24) of the UCC defines money as “a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a \ndomestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.” As long as the medium of exchange was such at \nthe time the instrument was made, it is payable in money, even if the medium of exchange has been \nabolished at the time the instrument is due. Section 3-107 provides the following as to payment in foreign \ncurrency: “Unless the instrument otherwise provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in \nforeign money may be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated by using \nthe current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the purchase of dollars on the day on which",

Section 3-206(a) of the UCC provides that an attempt to limit payment to a particular person or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n821 \nprohibit further transfer “is not effective.” Nor is “[a]n indorsement stating a condition to the right of the \nindorsee to receive payment”; the restriction may be disregarded. However, two legitimate restrictive \nindorsements are valid: collection indorsements and trust indorsements. Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. \nv. Richland State Bank (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with conditional and restrictive indorsements. \n \nCollection Indorsement \nIt is very common for people and businesses to mail checks to their bank for deposit to their accounts. \nSometimes mail goes astray or gets stolen. Surely it must be permissible for the customer to safeguard the \ncheck by restricting its use to depositing it in her account. A collection indorsement, such as “For \ndeposit” or “For collection,” is effective. Section 3-206(c) of the UCC provides that anybody other than a \nbank who purchases the instrument with such an indorsement converts the instrument—effectively steals \nit. A depositary bank that takes it must deposit it as directed, or the bank has converted it. A payor bank \nthat is also the depositary bank that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter \nconverts it: the check cannot be cashed; it must be deposited (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\"). \n \nTo illustrate, suppose that Kate Jones indorses her paycheck “For deposit only, Kate Jones,” which is by \nfar the most common type of restrictive indorsement (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", right). A \nthief steals the check, indorses his name below the restrictive indorsement, and deposits the check in Last \nBank, where he has an account, or cashes it. The check moves through the collection process to Second \nBank and then to First Bank, which pays the check. Kate has the right to recover only from Last Bank, \nwhich did not properly honor the indorsement by depositing the payment in her account. \n \nTrust Indorsement \nA second legitimate restrictive indorsement is indorsement in trust, called a \ntrust indorsement (sometimes agency indorsement). Suppose Paul Payee owes Carlene Creditor a \ndebt. Payee indorses a check drawn to him by a third party, “Pay to Tina Attorney in trust for Carlene \nCreditor.” Attorney indorses in blank and delivers it to (a) a holder for value, (b) a depository bank for \ncollection, or (c) a payor bank for payment. In each case, these takers can safely pay Attorney so long as \nthey have no notice under Section 3-307 of the UCC of any breach of fiduciary duty that Attorney may be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n822 \ncommitting. For example, under Section 3-307(b), these takers have notice of a breach of trust if the check \nwas taken in any transaction known by the taker to be for Attorney’s personal benefit. Subsequent \ntransferees of the check from the holder or depositary bank are not affected by the restriction unless they \nhave knowledge that Attorney dealt with the check in breach of trust (adapted from UCC, Section 3-206, \nOfficial Comment 4). (Of course Attorney should not indorse in blank; she should indorse “Tina Attorney, \nin trust for Carlene Creditor” and deposit the check in her trust account.) \n \nThe dichotomy here between restrictive and unrestrictive indorsements is the indorser’s way of showing \nto what use the instrument may be put. \n \nConditional Indorsement \nAn indorser might want to condition the negotiation of an instrument upon some event, such as “Pay \nCarla Green if she finishes painting my house by July 15.” Such a conditional indorsement is generally \nineffective: the UCC, Section 3-206(b), says a person paying for value can disregard the condition without \nliability. \n \nQualified Indorsement \nAn indorser can limit his liability by making a qualified indorsement. The usual qualified indorsement \nconsists of the words “without recourse,” which mean that the indorser has no contract liability to \nsubsequent holders if a maker or drawee defaults. A qualified indorsement does not impair negotiability. \nThe qualification must be in writing by signature on the instrument itself. By disclaiming contract \nliability, the qualified indorser also limits his warranty liabilities, though he does not eliminate them. \nSection 3-415(a) of the UCC narrows the indorser’s warranty that no defense of any party is good against \nthe indorser. In its place, the qualified indorser warrants merely that he has no knowledge of any defense. \n \n“Without recourse” indorsements can have a practical impact on the balance sheet. A company holding a \npromissory note can obtain cash by discounting it—indorsing it over to a bank for maturity value less the \nbank’s discount. As an indorser, however, the company remains liable to pay the amount to subsequent \nholders should the maker default at maturity. The balance sheet must reflect this possibility as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n823",

The defendant owns and operates New York’s largest \nthoroughbred racetracks—Belmont Park Racetrack, Aqueduct Racetrack, and Saratoga Racetrack—where \nit stages thoroughbred horse races and conducts pari-mutuel wagering on them pursuant to a franchise \ngranted to the defendant by the State of New York. \n \nThe plaintiff was a Belmont Park Racetrack horse player. He attended the track and purchased from the \ndefendant a voucher for use in SAMS machines. As explained in [Citation]: \nIn addition to accepting bets placed at parimutuel facility windows staffed by facility employees, \n[some] facilities use SAMS. SAMS are automated machines which permit a bettor to enter his bet \nby inserting money, vouchers or credit cards into the machine, thereby enabling him to select the \nnumber or combination he wishes to purchase. A ticket is issued showing those numbers. [1] \n \nWhen a voucher is utilized for the purpose of placing a bet at a SAMS machine, the SAMS machine, after \ndeducting the amount bet by the horse player during the particular transaction, provides the horse player \nwith, in addition to his betting ticket(s), a new voucher showing the remaining balance left on the \nvoucher. \n \nIn the instant case, the unfortunate horse player departed the SAMS machine with his betting tickets, \nbut without his new voucher—showing thousands of dollars in remaining value—which he inadvertently \nleft sitting in the SAMS machine. Within several minutes he realized his mistake and hurried back to the \nSAMS machine, only to find the voucher gone. He immediately notified a security guard. The defendant’s \npersonnel thereafter quickly confirmed the plaintiff as the original purchaser of the lost voucher. The \ndefendant placed a computerized “stop” on the voucher. However, whoever had happened upon the \nvoucher in the SAMS machine and taken it had acted even more quickly: the voucher had been brought to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n832 \na nearby track window and “cashed out” within a minute or so of the plaintiff having mistakenly left it in \nthe SAMS machine. \n \nThe plaintiff now sues the defendant, contending that the defendant should be liable for having failed to \n“provide any minimal protection to its customers” in checking the identity and ownership of vouchers \nprior to permitting their “cash out.” The defendant, in response, contends that the voucher consists of \n“bearer paper,” negotiable by anyone having possession, and that it is under no obligation to purchasers \nof vouchers to provide any such identity or ownership checks. \n \nAs opposed to instruments such as ordinary checks, which are typically made payable to the order of a \nspecific person and are therefore known as “order paper,” bearer paper is payable to the “bearer,” i.e., \nwhoever walks in carrying (or “bearing”) the instrument. Pursuant to [New York’s UCC] “[a]n instrument \nis payable to bearer when by its terms it is payable to…(c) ‘cash’ or the order of ‘cash’, or any other \nindication which does not purport to designate a specific payee.” \n \nEach New York Racing Association voucher is labeled “Cash Voucher.” Each voucher contains the legend \n“Bet Against the Value or Exchange for Cash.” Each voucher is also encoded with certain computer \nsymbols which are readable by SAMS machines. The vouchers do by their terms constitute “bearer paper.” \n \nThere is no doubt that under the [1990 Revision] Model Uniform Commercial Code the defendant would \nbe a “holder in due course” of the voucher, deemed to have taken it free from all defenses that could be \nraised by the plaintiff. As observed in 2 White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code pp. 225–226, 152–\n153 (4th ed.1995): \n \nConsider theft of bearer instruments…[T]he thief can make his or her transferee a holder simply \nby transfer to one who gives value in good faith. If the thief’s transferee cashes the check and so \ngives value in good faith and without notice of any defense, that transferee will be a holder in due \ncourse under 3-302, free of all claims to the instrument on the part…of any person and free of all \npersonal defenses of any prior party. Therefore, the holder in due course will not be liable in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n833 \nconversion to the true owner.…Of course, the owner of the check will have a good cause of action \nagainst the thief, but no other cause of action.… \n \nIf an instrument is payable to bearer…the possessor of the instrument will be a holder and, if he \nmeets the other tests, a holder in due course. This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York.

In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a \nparty. An alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration \nunless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. But a nonfraudulent alteration—for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n865 \nexample, filling in an omitted date or giving the obligor the benefit of a lower interest rate—does not \ndischarge the obligor. In any case, the person paying or taking the instrument may pay or collect \n“according to its original terms, or in the case of an incomplete instrument that is altered by unauthorized \ncompletion, according to its terms as completed. If blanks are filled or an incomplete instrument is \notherwise completed, subsection (c) places the loss upon the party who left the instrument incomplete by \npermitting enforcement in its completed form. This result is intended even though the instrument was \nstolen from the issuer and completed after the theft.” A moral here: don’t leave instruments lying around \nwith blanks that could be filled in. \n \nVoid Contract \nA void contract is distinguished from a voidable contract; only the former is a real defense. \n \nFraud in the Execution \nYou may recall that this is the rather unusual situation in which a person is tricked into signing a \ndocument. Able holds out a piece of paper for her boss and points to the signature line, saying, “This is a \nreceipt for goods we received a little while ago.” Baker signs it. It is not a receipt; it’s the signature line on \na promissory note. Able has committed fraud in the execution, and the note is void. \n \nDischarge of Which the Holder Has Notice \nIf the holder knows that the paper—a note, say—has already been paid, she cannot enforce it. That’s a \ngood reason to take back any note you have made from the person who presents it to you for payment. \n \nConsumer Transactions and Holders in Due Course \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine often worked considerable hardship on the consumer, usually as the \nmaker of an installment note. \n \nFor example, a number of students are approached by a gym owner who induces them to sign one-year \npromissory notes for $150 for a one-year gym membership. The owner says, “I know that right now the \nequipment in the gym is pretty rudimentary, but then, too, $150 is about half what you’d pay at the YMCA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n866 \nor Gold’s Gym. And the thing is, as we get more customers signing up, we’re going to use the money to \ninvest in new equipment. So within several months we’ll have a fully equipped facility for your use.” \nSeveral students sign the notes, which the owner sells to a factor (one that lends money to another, \ntaking back a negotiable instrument as security, usually at about a 20 percent discount). The factor takes \nas an apparent HDC, but the gym idea doesn’t work and the owner declares bankruptcy. If this were a \ncommercial transaction, the makers (the students) would still owe on the notes even if there was, as here, \na complete failure of consideration (called “paying on a dead horse”). But the students don’t have to pay. \n \nWhether the gym owner here committed fraud is uncertain, but the holder-in-due-course doctrine did \noften work to promote fraud. Courts frequently saw cases brought by credit companies (factors) against \nconsumers who bought machines that did not work and services that did not live up to their promises. The \nancient concept of an HDC did not square with the realities of modern commerce, in which instruments \nby the millions are negotiated for uncompleted transactions. The finance company that bought such \ncommercial paper could never have honestly claimed (in the sociological sense) to be wholly ignorant that \nmany makers will have claims against their payees (though they could and did make the claim in the legal \nsense). \n \nActing to curb abuses, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1976 promulgated a trade regulation rule \nthat in effect abolished the holder-in-due-course rule for consumer credit transactions. Under the FTC \nrule titled “Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses,” [3] the creditor becomes a mere holder and \nstands in the shoes of the seller, subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the \nseller. Specifically, the rule requires the seller to provide notice in any consumer credit contract that the",

App. 1999) \n \nLytton, J. \n \nFacts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n869 \nOmni purchased some grain from Country Grain, and on February 2, 1996, it issued two checks, totaling \n$75,000, to Country Grain. Country Grain, in turn, endorsed the checks over to Carter as a retainer for \nfuture legal services. Carter deposited the checks on February 5; Country Grain failed the next day. On \nFebruary 8, Carter was notified that Omni had stopped payment on the checks. Carter subsequently filed \na complaint against Omni…alleging that it was entitled to the proceeds of the checks, plus pre-judgment \ninterest, as a holder in due course.…[Carter moved for summary judgment; the motion was denied.] \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nCarter argues that its motion for summary judgment should have been granted because, as a holder in due \ncourse, it has the right to recover on the checks from the drawer, Omni. \n \nThe Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) defines a holder in due course as: \n“the holder of an instrument if: \n \n(1) the instrument when issued does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is \nnot otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity, and (2) the \nholder took the instrument (i) for value,… \n \nSection 3-303(a) of the UCC also states that: \n \n(a) “An instrument is issued or transferred for value if: (1) the instrument is issued or transferred \nfor a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed * * *.” \n(emphasis added) \n \nCarter contends that in Illinois a contract for future legal services should be treated differently than other \nexecutory contracts. It contends that when the attorney-client relationship is created by payment of a fee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n870 \nor retainer, the contract is no longer executory. Thus, Carter would achieve holder in due course status. \nWe are not persuaded. \n \nA retainer is the act of a client employing an attorney; it also denotes the fee paid by the client when he \nretains the attorney to act for him. [Citation] We have found no Illinois cases construing section 3-303(a) \nas it relates to a promise to perform future legal services under a retainer. The general rule, however, is \nthat “an executory promise is not value.” [Citation] “[T]he promise does not rise to the level of ‘value’ in \nthe commercial paper market until it is actually performed.” [Citation] \n \nThe UCC comment to section 303 gives the following example: \n \n“Case # 2. X issues a check to Y in consideration of Y’s promise to perform services in the future. Although \nthe executory promise is consideration for issuance of the check it is value only to the extent the promise \nis performed. \n \nWe have found no exceptions to these principles for retainers. Indeed, courts in other jurisdictions \ninterpreting similar language under section 3-303 have held that attorneys may be holders in due course \nonly to the extent that they have actually performed legal services prior to acquiring a negotiable \ninstrument. See [Citations: Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts]. We agree. \n \nThis retainer was a contract for future legal services. Under section 3-303(a)(1), it was a “promise of \nperformance,” not yet performed. Thus, no value was received, and Carter is not a holder in due course. \n \nFurthermore, in this case, no evidence was presented in the trial court that Carter performed any legal \nservices for Country Grain prior to receiving the checks. Without an evidentiary basis for finding that \nCarter received the checks for services performed, the trial court correctly found that Carter failed to \nprove that it was a holder in due course. [Citations] \n \nConclusion \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n871 \nBecause we have decided that Carter did not take the checks for value under section 3-303(a) of the UCC, \nwe need not address its other arguments. \n \nThe judgment of the circuit court of Peoria County is affirmed. \n \nHoldridge, J., dissenting. \nI respectfully dissent. In a contractual relationship between attorney and client, the payment of a fee or \nretainer creates the relationship, and once that relationship is created the contract is no longer executory. \n[Citation] Carter’s agreement to enter into an attorney-client relationship with Country Grain was the \nvalue exchanged for the checks endorsed over to the firm. Thus, the general rule cited by the majority that \n“an executory promise is not value” does not apply to the case at bar. On that basis I would hold that the \ntrial court erred in determining that Carter was not entitled to the check proceeds and I therefore dissent. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. How did Carter & Grimsley obtain the two checks drawn by Omni? \n2. Why—apparently—did Omni stop payments on the checks? \n3. Why did the court determine that Carter was not an HDC?",

[Citation] Under that standard, absent fraudulent behavior, an \notherwise innocent party was assumed to have acted in good faith. The “honesty in fact” requirement, also \nknown as the “pure heart and empty head” doctrine, is a subjective test under which a holder had to \nsubjectively believe he was negotiating an instrument in good faith for him to become a holder in due \ncourse. Maine [Citation, 1999]. \n \nIn 1994, however, the Ohio legislature amended the definition of “good faith” to include not only the \nsubjective “honesty in fact” test, but also an objective test: “the observance of reasonable commercial \nstandards of fair dealing.” Ohio UCC 1-201(20). A holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective \nand an objective test of good faith. What constitutes “reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing” for \nparties claiming holder-in-due-course status, however, has not heretofore been defined in the state of \nOhio. \n \nIn support of his contention that Buckeye is not a holder in due course, Sheth cites a decision from the \nSupreme Court of Maine, [referred to above] in which the court provided clarification with respect to the \nobjective prong of the “good faith” analysis: \n \n“The fact finder must therefore determine, first, whether the conduct of the holder comported with \nindustry or ‘commercial’ standards applicable to the transaction and second, whether those \nstandards were reasonable standards intended to result in fair dealing. Each of those \ndeterminations must be made in the context of the specific transaction at hand. If the fact finder’s \nconclusion on each point is ‘yes,’ the holder will be determined to have acted in good faith even if, \nin the individual transaction at issue, the result appears unreasonable. Thus, a holder may be \naccorded holder in due course where it acts pursuant to those reasonable commercial standards \nof fair dealing—even if it is negligent—but may lose that status, even where it complies with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n875 \ncommercial standards, if those standards are not reasonably related to achieving fair dealing.” \n[Citation] \n \nCheck cashing is an unlicensed and unregulated business in Ohio. [Citation] Thus, there are no concrete \ncommercial standards by which check-cashing businesses must operate. Moreover, Buckeye argues that \nits own internal operating policies do not require that it verify the availability of funds, nor does Buckeye \napparently have any guidelines with respect to the acceptance of postdated checks. Buckeye asserts that \ncashing a postdated check does not prevent a holder from obtaining holder-in-due-course status and cites \nseveral cases in support of this contention. All of the cases cited by Buckeye, however, were decided prior \nto the UCC’s addition of the objective prong to the definition of “good faith.” \n \nUnder a purely subjective “honesty in fact” analysis, it is clear that Buckeye accepted the check from Camp \nin good faith and would therefore achieve holder-in-due-course status. When the objective prong of the \ngood faith test is applied, however, we find that Buckeye did not conduct itself in a commercially \nreasonable manner. While not going so far as to say that cashing a postdated check prevents a holder from \nobtaining holder-in-due-course status in every instance, the presentation of a postdated check should put \nthe check cashing entity on notice that the check might not be good. Buckeye accepted the postdated \ncheck at its own peril. Some attempt at verification should be made before a check-cashing business",

[Citations] This is made clear by § 3-408, which states: \n \nA check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the \ndrawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until the drawee \naccepts it. \n \nOnce a bank accepts a check, under § 3-409, it is obliged to pay on the check under § 3-413. Thus, the \nrelevant question in terms of any rights Petitioner had against the Bank [regarding presentment] turns \nnot on the reasonableness of the thumbprint identification, but rather upon whether the Bank accepted \nthe check when presented as defined by § 3-409. As will be seen infra [below] the question of the \nthumbprint identification is relevant only to the issue of whether the Bank’s refusal to pay the instrument \nconstituted dishonor under § 3-502, a determination which has no impact in terms of any duty allegedly \nowed by the Bank to the Petitioner. \n \nThe statute clearly states that acceptance becomes effective when the presenter is notified of that fact. The \nfacts demonstrate that at no time did the teller notify Petitioner that the Bank would pay on the check. \nRather, the facts show that: \n[T]he check was given back to [Petitioner] by the teller so that he could put his thumbprint \nsignature on it, not to notify or give him rights on the purported acceptance. After appellant \ndeclined to put his thumbprint signature on the check, he was informed by both the teller and the \nbranch manager that it was against bank policy to honor the check without a thumbprint \nsignature. Indignant, [Petitioner] walked out of the bank with the check. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n920 \n \nAs the intermediate appellate court correctly pointed out, the negotiation of the check is in the nature of a \ncontract, and there can be no agreement until notice of acceptance is received. As a result, there was never \nacceptance as defined by § 3-409(a), and thus the Bank, pursuant to § 3-408 never was obligated to pay \nthe check under § 3-413(a). Thus, the answer to Petitioner’s second question [Did the lower court err in \nfinding the Bank did not accept the…check at issue, as “acceptance” is defined in UCC Section 3-409?] is \n“no.” \n \n“Conversion” under § 3-420. \n \nBecause it never accepted the check, Bank of America argues that the intermediate appellate court also \ncorrectly concluded that the Bank did not convert the check or its proceeds under § 3-420. Again, we must \nagree. The Court of Special Appeals stated: \n \n“Conversion,” we have held, “requires not merely temporary interference with property rights, \nbut the exercise of unauthorized dominion and control to the complete exclusion of the rightful \npossessor.” [Citation] At no time did [Respondent] exercise “unauthorized dominion and control \n[over the check] to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor,” [Petitioner]. \n \n[Petitioner] voluntarily gave the check to [Respondent’s] teller. When [Petitioner] indicated to the \nteller that he was not an account holder, she gave the check back to him for a thumbprint \nsignature in accordance with bank policy. After being informed by both [Respondent’s] teller and \nbranch manager that it was [Respondent’s] policy not to cash a non-account holder’s check \nwithout a thumbprint signature, [Petitioner] left the bank with the check in hand. \n \nBecause [Petitioner] gave the check to the teller, [Respondent’s] possession of that check was \nanything but “unauthorized,” and having returned the check, within minutes of its receipt, to \n[Petitioner] for his thumbprint signature, [Respondent] never exercised “dominion and control",

No checks change hands; no paper is written on. It is quiet, odorless, smudge proof. But errors \nare harder to trace than when a paper trail exists, and when the system fails (“our computer is down”) the \nfinancial mess can be colossal. Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows. \n \n1. Proof of transaction. The electronic terminal itself must be equipped to provide a receipt of transfer, \nshowing date, amount, account number, and certain other information. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe bank or other financial institution must provide you with a monthly statement listing all \nelectronic transfers to and from the account, including transactions made over the computer or \ntelephone, and must show to whom payment has been made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n954 \n2. Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation.",

Recourse for loss or theft. If you notify the issuer of your EFT card within two business days after \nlearning that your card (or code number) is missing or stolen, your liability is limited to $50. If you \nfail to notify the issuer in this time, your liability can go as high as $500. More daunting is the \nprospect of loss if you fail within sixty days to notify the financial institution of an unauthorized \ntransfer noted on your statement: after sixty days of receipt, your liability is unlimited. In other \nwords, a thief thereafter could withdraw all your funds and use up your line of credit and you would \nhave no recourse against the financial institution for funds withdrawn after the sixtieth day, if you \nfailed to notify it of the unauthorized transfer. \n4. Mandatory use of EFT. Your employer or a government agency can compel you to accept a salary \npayment or government benefit by electronic transfer. But no creditor can insist that you repay \noutstanding loans or pay off other extensions of credit electronically. The act prohibits a financial \ninstitution from sending you an EFT card “valid for use” unless you specifically request one or it is \nreplacing or renewing an expired card. The act also requires the financial institution to provide you \nwith specific information concerning your rights and responsibilities (including how to report losses \nand thefts, resolve errors, and stop payment of preauthorized transfers). A financial institution may \nsend you a card that is “not valid for use” and that you alone have the power to validate if you choose \nto do so, after the institution has verified that you are the person for whom the card was intended. \n \n \n \nLiability of the Financial Institution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n955 \nThe financial institution’s failure to make an electronic fund transfer, in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of an account, in the correct amount or in a timely manner when properly instructed to do so \nby the consumer makes it liable for all damages proximately caused to the consumer, except where \n \n1) the consumer’s account has insufficient funds; \n2) the funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting such transfer; \n3) such transfer would exceed an established credit limit; \n4) an electronic terminal has insufficient cash to complete the transaction; or \n5) a circumstance beyond its control, where it exercised reasonable care to prevent such an \noccurrence, or exercised such diligence as the circumstances required. \n \nEnforcement of the Act \nA host of federal regulatory agencies oversees enforcement of the act. These include the Comptroller of the \nCurrency (national banks), Federal Reserve District Bank (state member banks), Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation regional director (nonmember insured banks), Federal Home Loan Bank Board \nsupervisory agent (members of the FHLB system and savings institutions insured by the Federal Savings \n& Loan Insurance Corporation), National Credit Union Administration (federal credit unions), Securities \n& Exchange Commission (brokers and dealers), and the Federal Trade Commission (retail and \ndepartment stores) consumer finance companies, all nonbank debit card issuers, and certain other \nfinancial institutions. Additionally, consumers are empowered to sue (individually or as a class) for actual \ndamages caused by any EFT system, plus penalties ranging from $100 to $1,000. Section 23.4 \"Cases\", \nunder “Customer’s Duty to Inspect Bank Statements” (Commerce Bank v.

The Lumber Company “laminated” the two by six-inch boards to \nmake them stronger. However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn.

The Bank filed a motion \nfor summary judgment, which the trial court denied. At the subsequent jury trial the court permitted \nMeade to testify, over the Bank’s objections, to the amount of his court costs, attorney fees, and deposition \ncosts associated with this case. The Bank filed motions for directed verdict at the close of Meade’s case \nand at the close of evidence, which the trial court denied. \n \nThe jury returned a general verdict finding the Bank liable to Meade in the amount of $3,800. The Bank \nfiled motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court denied. \nThe Bank now appeals, asserting the following five assignments of error.… \n \nII. \nIn its first assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for \nsummary judgment. Specifically, the Bank asserts that Meade did not issue the stop payment order within \na reasonable time for the Bank to act upon it, and therefore that the trial court should have granted \nsummary judgment in favor of the Bank. \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate only when it has been established: (1) that there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that \nreasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving \nparty. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n967 \n[UCC 4-403(A)] provides that a customer may stop payment on any item drawn on the customer’s \naccount by issuing an order to the bank that describes the item with reasonable certainty and is received \nby the bank “at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before \nany action by the bank with respect to the item.” What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the \nfacts of the case. See Chute v. Bank One of Akron, (1983) [Citation] \n \nIn Chute, Bank One alleged that its customer, Mr. Chute, did not give it a reasonable opportunity to act \nupon his stop payment order when he gave an oral stop payment at one Bank One branch office, and a \ndifferent Bank One branch office paid the check the following day. In ruling that Bank One had a \nreasonable opportunity to act upon Mr. Chute’s order before it paid the check, the court considered the \nteller’s testimony that stop payment orders are entered onto the computer upon receipt, where they are \nvirtually immediately accessible to all Bank One tellers. \n \nIn this case, as in Chute, Meade gave notice one day, and the Bank paid the check the following day. \nAdditionally, in this case, the same branch that took the stop payment order also paid the check. \nMoreover, Evans testified that the Bank’s policy for stop payment orders is to enter them into the \ncomputer immediately, and that Meade’s stop payment order may have shown up on the computer on \nSaturday if she had entered it on Friday. Based on this information, and construing the facts in the light \nmost favorable to Meade, reasonable minds could conclude that Meade provided the Bank with the stop \npayment order within time for the Bank to act upon the stop payment order. Accordingly, we overrule the \nBank’s first assignment of error. \n \nIII. \nIn its second assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in permitting Meade to \ntestify regarding the amount he spent on court costs, attorney fees, and taking depositions. Meade \ncontends that because he incurred these costs as a result of the Bank paying his check over a valid stop \npayment order, the costs are properly recoverable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n968 \nAs a general rule, the costs and expenses of litigation, other than court costs, are not recoverable in an \naction for damages. [Citations] \n \nIn this case, the statute providing for damages, [UCC 4-403(c)], provides that a customer’s recoverable \nloss for a bank’s failure to honor a valid stop payment order “may include damages for dishonor of \nsubsequent items * * *.” The statute does not provide for recouping attorney fees and costs. Meade did not \nallege that the Bank acted in bad faith or that he is entitled to punitive damages.

Whether Rogers’ Delay in Detecting the Forgeries Barred Suit against Union Planters. \n \nThe relationship between Rogers and Union Planters is governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial \nCode. [UCC] 4-406(a) and (c) provide that a bank customer has a duty to discover and report \n“unauthorized signatures”; i.e., forgeries. [The section] reflects an underlying policy decision that furthers \nthe UCC’s “objective of promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.” The UCC \nfacilitates financial transactions, benefiting both consumers and financial institutions, by allocating \nresponsibility among the parties according to whomever is best able to prevent a loss. Because the \ncustomer is more familiar with his own signature, and should know whether or not he authorized a \nparticular withdrawal or check, he can prevent further unauthorized activity better than a financial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n973 \ninstitution which may process thousands of transactions in a single day.…The customer’s duty to exercise \nthis care is triggered when the bank satisfies its burden to provide sufficient information to the customer. \nAs a result, if the bank provides sufficient information, the customer bears the loss when he fails to detect \nand notify the bank about unauthorized transactions. [Citation] \n \nA. Union Planters’ Duty to Provide Information under 4-406(a). \nThe court admitted into evidence copies of all Union Planters statements sent to Rogers during the \nrelevant time period. Enclosed with the bank statements were either the cancelled checks themselves or \ncopies of the checks relating to the period of time of each statement. The evidence shows that all bank \nstatements and cancelled checks were sent, via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at \ntheir “designated address” each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary. We therefore find \nthat the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers and that the remaining \nprovisions of 4-406 are applicable to the case at bar.… \nIn defense of her failure to inspect the bank statements, Rogers claims that she never received the bank \nstatements and cancelled checks. Even if this allegation is true, [2] it does not excuse Rogers from failing to \nfulfill her duties under 4-406(a) & (c) because the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in \nproviding the necessary information to a customer when it “sends…to a customer a statement of account \nshowing payment of items.”…The word “receive” is absent. The customer’s duty to inspect and report does \nnot arise when the statement is received, as Rogers claims; the customer’s duty to inspect and report \narises when the bank sends the statement to the customer’s address. A reasonable person who has not \nreceived a monthly statement from the bank would promptly ask the bank for a copy of the statement. \nHere, Rogers claims that she did not receive numerous statements. We find that she failed to act \nreasonably when she failed to take any action to replace the missing statements. \n \nB. Rogers’ Duty to Report the Forgeries under 4-406(d). \n[Under UCC 4-406] a customer who has not promptly notified a bank of an irregularity may be precluded \nfrom bringing certain claims against the bank: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n974 \n“(d) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties \nimposed on the customer by subsection (c), the customer is precluded from asserting against the \nbank: \n(1) The customer’s unauthorized signature…on the item,… \n \nAlso, when there is a series of forgeries, 406(d)(2) places additional duties on the customer, [who is \nprecluded from asserting against the bank]: \n \n(2) The customer’s unauthorized signature…by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in \ngood faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the \ncustomer of the unauthorized signature…and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable \nperiod of time, not exceeding thirty (30) days, in which to examine the item or statement of \naccount and notify the bank. \nAlthough there is no mention of a specific date, Rogers testified that she and her son began looking for the \nstatements in late May or early June of 2001, after her husband had died.…When they discovered that \nstatements were missing, they notified Union Planters in June of 2001 to replace the statements. At this \ntime, no mention of possible forgery was made, even though Neal, Jr., thought that “something was \nwrong.” In fact, Neal, Jr., had felt that something was wrong as far back as December of 2000, but failed \nto do anything. Neal, Jr., testified that neither he nor his mother knew that Reese had been forging checks \nuntil September of 2001.

But a creditor may not use these devices to cloak what is in fact a \nusurious bargain; it is not the form but the substance of the agreement that controls. \n \nAs suggested, part of the difficulty here is that governments at all levels have for a generation attempted to \npromote consumption to promote production; production is required to maintain politically acceptable \nlevels of employment. If consumers can get what they want on credit, consumerism increases. Also, \ncertainly, tight limits on interest rates cause creditors to deny credit to the less creditworthy, which may \nnot be helpful to the lower classes. That’s the rationale for the usury exceptions related to pawnshop and \npayday loans. \n \n \nDisclosure of Credit Costs \nSetting limits on what credit costs—as usury laws do—is one thing. Disclosing the cost of credit is another. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act \nUntil 1969, lenders were generally free to disclose the cost of money loaned or credit extended in any way \nthey saw fit—and they did. Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why? Because with the first loan you will have the use of the full \n$1,000 for the entire year; with the second, for much less than the year because you must begin repaying \npart of the principal within a month. In fact, with the second loan you will have use of only about half the \nmoney for the entire year, and so the actual rate of interest is closer to 15 percent. Things become more \ncomplex when interest is compounded and stated as a monthly figure, when different rates apply to \nvarious portions of the loan, and when processing charges and other fees are stated separately. The act \nregulates open-end credit (revolving credit, like charge cards) and closed-end credit (like a car loan—\nextending for a specific period), and—as amended later—it regulates consumer leases and credit card \ntransactions, too. \nFigure 24.1 Credit Disclosure Form \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n990 \n \n \nBy requiring that the finance charge and the annual percentage rate be disclosed on a uniform basis, the \nTILA makes understanding and comparison of loans much easier. The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are",

Errors \ncan include charges not incurred or those billed with the wrong description, charges for goods never \ndelivered, accounting or arithmetic errors, failure to credit payments or returns, and even charges for \nwhich you simply request additional information, including proof of sale. During the time the creditor is \nreplying, you need not pay the questioned item or any finance charge on the disputed amount. \n \nThe creditor has thirty days to respond and ninety days to correct your account or explain why your belief \nthat an error has been committed is incorrect. If you do turn out to be wrong, the creditor is entitled to all \nback finance charges and to prompt payment of the disputed amount. If you persist in disagreeing and \nnotify the creditor within ten days, it is obligated to tell all credit bureaus to whom it sends notices of \ndelinquency that the bill continues to be disputed and to tell you to whom such reports have been sent; \nwhen the dispute has been settled, the creditor must notify the credit bureaus of this fact. Failure of the \ncreditor to follow the rules, an explanation of which must be provided to each customer every six months \nand when a dispute arises, bars it from collecting the first fifty dollars in dispute, plus finance charges, \neven if the creditor turns out to be correct. \n \nDisputes about the Quality of Goods or Services Purchased \nWhile disputes over the quality of goods are not “billing errors,” the act does apply to unsatisfactory goods \nor services purchased by credit card (except for store credit cards); the customer may assert against the \ncredit card company any claims or defenses he or she may have against the seller. This means that under \ncertain circumstances, the customer may withhold payments without incurring additional finance \ncharges. However, this right is subject to three limitations: (1) the value of the goods or services charged \nmust be in excess of fifty dollars, (2) the goods or services must have been purchased either in the home \nstate or within one hundred miles of the customer’s current mailing address, and (3) the consumer must \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n999 \nmake a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute before refusing to pay. If the consumer does refuse to pay, \nthe credit card company would acquiesce: it would credit her account for the disputed amount, pass the \nloss down to the merchant’s bank, and that bank would debit the merchant’s account. The merchant \nwould then have to deal with the consumer directly. \n \n \nDebt Collection Practices \nBanks, financial institutions, and retailers have different incentives for extending credit—for some, a loan \nis simply a means of making money, and for others, it is an inducement to buyers. But in either case, \ncredit is a risk because the consumer may default; the creditor needs a means of collecting when the \ncustomer fails to pay. Open-end credit is usually given without collateral. The creditor can, of course, sue, \nbut if the consumer has no assets, collection can be troublesome. Historically, three different means of \nrecovering the debt have evolved: garnishment, wage assignment, and confession of judgment. \n \nGarnishment \nGarnishment is a legal process by which a creditor obtains a court order directing the debtor’s employer \n(or any party who owes money to the debtor) to pay directly to the creditor a certain portion of the \nemployee’s wages until the debt is paid. Until 1970, garnishment was regulated by state law, and its effects \ncould be devastating—in some cases, even leading to suicide. In 1970, Title III of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act asserted federal control over garnishment proceedings for the first time. The federal wage-\ngarnishment law limits the amount of employee earnings that may be withheld in any one pay date to the \nlesser of 25 percent of disposable (after-tax) earnings or the amount by which disposable weekly earnings \nexceed thirty times the highest current federal minimum wage. The federal law covers everyone who \nreceives personal earnings, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and retirement income \n(though not tips), but it allows courts to garnish above the federal maximum in cases involving support \npayments (e.g., alimony), in personal bankruptcy cases, and in cases where the debt owed is for state or \nfederal tax. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1000 \nThe federal wage-garnishment law also prohibits an employer from firing any worker solely because the \nworker’s pay has been garnished for one debt (multiple garnishments may be grounds for discharge). The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages.

The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought. In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional. [2] \n \nWage Assignment \nA wage assignment is an agreement by an employee that a creditor may take future wages as security \nfor a loan or to pay an existing debt. With a wage assignment, the creditor can collect directly from the \nemployer. However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977. \n \nThis law regulates the manner by which third-party collection agencies conduct their business. It covers \ncollection of all personal, family, and household debts by collection agencies. It does not deal with \ncollection by creditors themselves; the consumer’s remedy for abusive debt collection by the creditor is in \ntort law. \n \nUnder the FDCPA, the third-party collector may contact the debtor only during reasonable hours and not \nat work if the debtor’s employer prohibits it. The debtor may write the collector to cease contact, in which \ncase the agency is prohibited from further contact (except to confirm that there will be no further contact). \nA written denial that money is owed stops the bill collector for thirty days, and he can resume again only \nafter the debtor is sent proof of the debt. Collectors may no longer file suit in remote places, hoping for \ndefault judgments; any suit must be filed in a court where the debtor lives or where the underlying \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1002",

An oral promise to pay is no security at \nall, and—as it is oral—it is difficult to prove. A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor \nto repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a \ndefaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security \nfor the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an \nagreement. \n \nBy Agreement with the Debtor \nSecurity obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most \ncommon form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated \nparty does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate.",

Check out your loan \nagreement with us and UCC Section 9-204(c), especially Comment 5.” \n \nSee Figure 25.2 \"Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral\". \n \n \n \nFigure 25.2 Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1029 \n \n \nAttachment of the Security Interest \nIn General \nAttachment is the term used to describe when a security interest becomes enforceable against the debtor \nwith respect to the collateral. In Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\", ”Attachment” is the outreached hand \nthat is prepared, if the debtor defaults, to grasp the collateral. [21] \n \nRequirements for Attachment \nThere are three requirements for attachment: (1) the secured party gives value; (2) the debtor has rights in \nthe collateral or the power to transfer rights in it to the secured party; (3) the parties have a security \nagreement “authenticated” (signed) by the debtor, or the creditor has possession of the collateral. \n \n \n \nCreditor Gives Value \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1030 \nThe creditor, or secured party, must give “value” for the security interest to attach. The UCC, in Section 1-\n204, provides that \n \na person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them \n \n(1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately \navailable credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in \nthe event of difficulties in collection; or \n \n(2) as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim; or \n \n(3) by accepting delivery pursuant to a pre-existing contract for purchase; or \n \n(4) generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. \n \nSuppose Deborah owes Carl $3,000. She cannot repay the sum when due, so she agrees to give Carl a \nsecurity interest in her automobile to the extent of $3,000 in return for an extension of the time to pay. \nThat is sufficient value. \n \nDebtor’s Rights in Collateral \nThe debtor must have rights in the collateral. Most commonly, the debtor owns the collateral (or has some \nownership interest in it). The rights need not necessarily be the immediate right to possession, but they \nmust be rights that can be conveyed. [22] A person can’t put up as collateral property she doesn’t own. \n \nSecurity Agreement (Contract) or Possession of Collateral by Creditor \nThe debtor most often signs the written security agreement, or contract. The UCC says that “the debtor \n[must have] authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral.…” \n“Authenticating” (or “signing,” “adopting,” or “accepting”) means to sign or, in recognition of electronic \ncommercial transactions, “to execute or otherwise adopt a symbol, or encrypt or similarly process a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1031 \nrecord…with the present intent of the authenticating person to identify the person and adopt or accept a \nrecord.” The “record” is the modern UCC’s substitution for the term “writing.” It includes information \nelectronically stored or on paper. [23] \n \nThe “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common",

            "chunk": "with nothing. Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat. Who has priority? Whoever perfects first: \nthe rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet. Whoever can submit the financing \nstatement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not \ndepend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is claiming a security interest in the \nsame collateral. But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest \nfirst attached has priority? This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC \ncommentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation \nwithout [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, \nneither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee. \n \nTo rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors \nlose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected). If both parties are secured (have attached the \ninterest), the first to perfect wins. [1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins. [2] \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—\nactually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them. \n \nImmediate Exceptions \nWe call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate \npriority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it. They all involve purchase-money \nsecurity interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor \nhad sold the debtor. \n \n(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock). The UCC provides that \n“a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1042 \na conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase-money security interest is perfected \nwhen debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to \nthis UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an \nafter-acquired property clause.” \n \nSuppose Susan manufactures fur coats. On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would",

As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors \nPersons (including bankruptcy trustees) who become lien creditors before the security interest is \nperfected win out—the unperfected security interest is subordinate to lien creditors. Persons who become \nlien creditors after the security interest is perfected lose (subject to some nuances in situations where the \nlien arises between attachment by the creditor and the filing, and depending upon the type of security \ninterest and the type of collateral). [9] More straightforwardly, perhaps, a lien securing payment or \nperformance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1046 \nordinary course of business has priority over other security interests (unless a statute provides \notherwise). [10] This is the bailee or “material man” (one who supplies materials, as to build a house) with a \nlien situation. Garage Mechanic repairs a car in which Owner has previously given a perfected security \ninterest to Bank. Owner doesn’t pay Bank. Bank seeks to repossess the car from Mechanic. It will have to \npay the Mechanic first. And why not? If the car was not running, Bank would have to have it repaired \nanyway. \n \nBankruptcy Trustee \nTo what extent can the bankruptcy trustee take property previously encumbered by a security interest? It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does. The rationale: “this…enables banks to extend credit to their depositors without the need to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1047 \nexamine [records] to determine whether another party might have a security interest in the deposit \naccount.” [14] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nWho among competing creditors gets the collateral if the debtor defaults? The general rule on priorities is \nthat the first to secure most completely wins: if all competitors have perfected, the first to do so wins. If one \nhas perfected and the others have not, the one who perfects wins. If all have attached, the first to attach wins. \nIf none have attached, they’re all unsecured creditors. To this general rule there are a number of exceptions. \nPurchase-money security interests in goods and inventory prevail over previously perfected secured parties in \nthe same goods and inventory (subject to some requirements); fixture financers who file properly have \npriority over previously perfected mortgagees. Buyers in the ordinary course of business take free of a security \ninterest created by their seller, so long as they don’t know their purchase violates a security agreement.",

They have trained car-lock pickers, in-\nhouse locksmiths, experienced repossession teams, damage-free towing equipment, and the capacity to \ndeliver repossessed collateral to the client’s desired destination. Some firms advertise that they have 360-\ndegree video cameras that record every aspect of the repossession. They have “skip chasers”—people \nwhose business it is to track down those who skip out on their obligations, and they are trained not to \nbreach the peace. [1] See Pantoja-Cahue v. Ford Motor Credit Co., a case discussing repossession, \nin Section 25.5 \"Cases\". \nThe reference in Section 9-609(a)(2) to “render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a \ndebtor’s premises” gets to situations involving “heavy equipment [when] the physical removal from the \ndebtor’s plant and the storage of collateral pending disposition may be impractical or unduly \nexpensive.…Of course…all aspects of the disposition must be commercially reasonable.” [2]Rendering the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1050 \nequipment unusable would mean disassembling some critical part of the machine—letting it sit there until \nan auction is set up on the premises. \n \nThe creditor’s agents—the repo people—charge for their service, of course, and if possible the cost of \nrepossession comes out of the collateral when it’s sold. A debtor would be better off voluntarily delivering \nthe collateral according to the creditor’s instructions, but if that doesn’t happen, “self-help”—\nrepossession—is allowed because, of course, the debtor said it would be allowed in the security agreement, \nso long as the repossession can be accomplished without breach of peace. “Breach of peace” is language \nthat can cover a wide variety of situations over which courts do not always agree. For example, some \ncourts interpret a creditor’s taking of the collateral despite the debtor’s clear oral protest as a breach of the \npeace; other courts do not. \n \nDisposition after Repossession \nAfter repossession, the creditor has two options: sell the collateral or accept it in satisfaction of the debt \n(see Figure 25.5 \"Disposition after Repossession\"). \n \nFigure 25.5 Disposition after Repossession \n \nSale \nSale is the usual method of recovering the debt. Section 9-610 of the UCC permits the secured creditor to \n“sell, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of any or all of the collateral in its present condition or following \nany commercially reasonable preparation or processing.” The collateral may be sold as a whole or in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1051 \nparcels, at one time or at different times. Two requirements limit the creditor’s power to resell: (1) it must \nsend notice to the debtor and secondary obligor, and (unless consumer goods are sold) to other secured \nparties; and (2) all aspects of the sale must be “commercially reasonable.” [3] Most frequently the collateral \nis auctioned off. \n \nSection 9-615 of the UCC describes how the proceeds are applied: first, to the costs of the repossession, \nincluding reasonable attorney’s fees and legal expenses as provided for in the security agreement (and it \nwill provide for that!); second, to the satisfaction of the obligation owed; and third, to junior creditors. \nThis again emphasizes the importance of promptly perfecting the security interest: failure to do so \nfrequently subordinates the tardy creditor’s interest to junior status. If there is money left over from \ndisposing of the collateral—a surplus—the debtor gets that back. If there is still money owing—a \ndeficiency—the debtor is liable for that. In Section 9-616, the UCC carefully explains how the surplus or \ndeficiency is calculated; the explanation is required in a consumer goods transaction, and it has to be sent \nto the debtor after the disposition. \n \nStrict Foreclosure \nBecause resale can be a bother (or the collateral is appreciating in value), the secured creditor may wish \nsimply to accept the collateral in full satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the debt, as permitted in UCC \nSection 9-620(a). This is known as strict foreclosure. The debtor must consent to letting the creditor \ntake the collateral without a sale in a “record authenticated after default,” or after default the creditor can \nsend the debtor a proposal for the creditor to accept the collateral, and the proposal is effective if not \nobjected to within twenty days after it’s sent. \n \nThe strict foreclosure provisions contain a safety feature for consumer goods debtors. If the debtor has \npaid at least 60 percent of the debt, then the creditor may not use strict foreclosure—unless the debtor \nsigns a statement after default renouncing his right to bar strict foreclosure and to force a sale. [4] A \nconsumer who refuses to sign such a statement thus forces the secured creditor to sell the collateral under \nSection 9-610. Should the creditor fail to sell the goods within ninety days after taking possession of the",

Accordingly, the question here is whether breaking into a locked garage to effectuate a \nrepossession is a breach of the peace in violation of section 2A-525(3). \n \nThere are no Illinois cases analyzing the meaning of the term “breach of the peace” as used in the lessor \nrepossession context in section 2A-525(3).

The \nagents did not respond and proceeded to take the car. The plaintiff argued the repossession breached the \npeace and he was entitled to the statutory remedy for violation of section 9-503, denial of a deficiency \njudgment to the secured party, Chrysler.… \n \nAfter a thorough analysis of the term “breach of the peace,” the court concluded the term “connotes \nconduct which incites or is likely to incite immediate public turbulence, or which leads to or is likely to",

Douglas Asphalt Co. \n338 Fed.Appx. 886, 11th Cir. Ct. (2009) \n \nPer Curium: [1] \nThe Georgia Department of Transportation (“GDOT”) contracted with Douglas Asphalt Company to \nperform work on an interstate highway. After Douglas Asphalt allegedly failed to pay its suppliers and \nsubcontractors and failed to perform under the contract, GDOT defaulted and terminated Douglas \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1072 \nAsphalt. Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland and Zurich American Insurance Company had \nexecuted payment and performance bonds in connection with Douglas Asphalt’s work on the interstate, \nand after Douglas Asphalt’s default, Fidelity and Zurich spent $15,424,798 remedying the default. \n \nFidelity and Zurich, seeking to recover their losses related to their remedy of the default, brought this suit \nagainst Douglas Asphalt, Joel Spivey, and Ronnie Spivey. The Spiveys and Douglas Asphalt had executed \na General Indemnity Agreement in favor of Fidelity and Zurich. [2] \nAfter a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Fidelity and Zurich for $16,524,798. \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys now appeal. \n \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in entering judgment in favor of \nFidelity and Zurich because Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith in three ways. \n \nFirst, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in not finding that Fidelity and \nZurich acted in bad faith because they claimed excessive costs to remedy the default. Specifically, Douglas \nAsphalt and the Spiveys argue that they introduced evidence that the interstate project was 98% complete, \nand that only approximately $3.6 million was needed to remedy any default. But, the district court found \nthat the interstate project was only 90%–92% complete and that approximately $2 million needed to be \nspent to correct defective work already done by Douglas Asphalt. Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys have \nnot shown that the district court’s finding was clearly erroneous, and accordingly, their argument that \nFidelity and Zurich showed bad faith in claiming that the project was only 90% complete and therefore \nrequired over $15 million to remedy the default fails. \n \nSecond, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith by failing to \ncontest the default. However, the district court concluded that the indemnity agreement required Douglas \nAsphalt and the Spiveys to request a contest of the default, and to post collateral security to pay any \njudgment rendered in the course of contesting the default. The court’s finding that Douglas Asphalt and \nthe Spiveys made no such request and posted no collateral security was not clearly erroneous, and the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1073 \nsureties had no independent duty to investigate a default. Accordingly, Fidelity and Zurich’s failure to \ncontest the default does not show bad faith. \n \nFinally, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich’s refusal to permit them to remain \ninvolved with the interstate project, either as a contractor or consultant, was evidence of bad faith. Yet, \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys did not direct the district court or this court to any case law that holds \nthat the refusal to permit a defaulting contractor to continue working on a project is bad faith. As the \ndistrict court concluded, Fidelity and Zurich had a contractual right to take possession of all the work \nunder the contract and arrange for its completion. Fidelity and Zurich exercised that contractual right, \nand, as the district court noted, the exercise of a contractual right is not evidence of bad faith. \n \nFinding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why were Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys supposed to pay the sureties nearly $15.5 million? \n2. What did the plaintiffs claim the defendant sureties did wrong as relates to how much money they spent to \ncure the default? \n3. What is a “contest of the default”? \n4. Why would the sureties probably not want the principal involved in the project? \n \n  \n \n[1] Latin for “by the court.” A decision of an appeals court as a whole in which no judge is identified as the specific \nauthor. \n[2] They promised to reimburse the surety for its expenses and hold it harmless for further liability. \n \n \n \n25.6 Summary and Exercises \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org",

            "chunk": "loan): a person can take out a mortgage on land to fund a vacation. Indeed, during the period leading up \nto the recession in 2007–08, a lot of people borrowed money on their houses to buy things: boats, new \ncars, furniture, and so on. Unfortunately, it turned out that some of the real estate used as collateral was \novervalued: when the economy weakened and people lost income or their jobs, they couldn’t make the \nmortgage payments. And, to make things worse, the value of the real estate sometimes sank too, so that \nthe debtors owed more on the property than it was worth (that’s called being underwater). They couldn’t \nsell without taking a loss, and they couldn’t make the payments. Some debtors just walked away, leaving \nthe banks with a large number of houses, commercial buildings, and even shopping centers on their \nhands. \n \nShort History of Mortgage Law \nThe mortgage has ancient roots, but the form we know evolved from the English land law in the Middle \nAges. Understanding that law helps to understand modern mortgage law. In the fourteenth century, the \nmortgage was a deed that actually transferred title to the mortgagee. If desired, the mortgagee could move \ninto the house, occupy the property, or rent it out. But because the mortgage obligated him to apply to the \nmortgage debt whatever rents he collected, he seldom ousted the mortgagor. Moreover, the mortgage set a \nspecific date (the “law day”) on which the debt was to be repaid. If the mortgagor did so, the mortgage \nbecame void and the mortgagor was entitled to recover the property. If the mortgagor failed to pay the \ndebt, the property automatically vested in the mortgagee. No further proceedings were necessary. \nThis law was severe. A day’s delay in paying the debt, for any reason, forfeited the land, and the courts \nstrictly enforced the mortgage. The only possible relief was a petition to the king, who over time referred \nthese and other kinds of petitions to the courts of equity. At first fitfully, and then as a matter of course \n(by the seventeenth century), the equity courts would order the mortgagee to return the land when the \nmortgagor stood ready to pay the debt plus interest. Thus a new right developed: the equitable right of \nredemption, known for short as the equity of redemption. In time, the courts held that this equity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1082 \nredemption was a form of property right; it could be sold and inherited. This was a powerful right: no \nmatter how many years later, the mortgagor could always recover his land by proffering a sum of money. \n \nUnderstandably, mortgagees did not warm to this interpretation of the law, because their property rights \nwere rendered insecure. They tried to defeat the equity of redemption by having mortgagors waive and \nsurrender it to the mortgagees, but the courts voided waiver clauses as a violation of public policy. Hence \na mortgage, once a transfer of title, became a security for debt. A mortgage as such can never be converted \ninto a deed of title. \n \nThe law did not rest there. Mortgagees won a measure of relief in the development of the foreclosure. \nOn default, the mortgagee would seek a court order giving the mortgagor a fixed time—perhaps six \nmonths or a year—within which to pay off the debt; under the court decree, failure meant that the \nmortgagor was forever foreclosed from asserting his right of redemption. This strict foreclosure gave \nthe mortgagee outright title at the end of the time period. \n \nIn the United States today, most jurisdictions follow a somewhat different approach: the mortgagee \nforecloses by forcing a public sale at auction. Proceeds up to the amount of the debt are the mortgagee’s to \nkeep; surplus is paid over to the mortgagor. Foreclosure by sale is the usual procedure in the United \nStates. At bottom, its theory is that a mortgage is a lien on land. (Foreclosure issues are further discussed \nin Section 26.2 \"Priority, Termination of the Mortgage, and Other Methods of Using Real Estate as \nSecurity\".) \nUnder statutes enacted in many states, the mortgagor has one last chance to recover his property, even \nafter foreclosure. This statutory right of redemption extends the period to repay, often by one year. \n \nCreation of the Mortgage \nStatutory Regulation \nThe decision whether to lend money and take a mortgage is affected by several federal and state \nregulations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1083 \nConsumer Credit Statutes Apply \nStatutes dealing with consumer credit transactions (as discussed in Chapter 24 \"Consumer Credit \nTransactions\") have a bearing on the mortgage, including state usury statutes, and the federal Truth in \nLending Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. \n \nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act \nOther federal statutes are directed more specifically at mortgage lending. One, enacted in 1974, is the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), aimed at abuses in the settlement process—the process of",

FL 2002) \n \nBackground \n \n[Paul Cherry filed a complaint suing Chase for Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violations and slander of \ncredit.]…Chase counter-claimed for foreclosure and reestablishment of the lost note.… \n \n…Chase held a mortgage on Cherry’s home to which Cherry made timely payments until August 2000. \nCherry stopped making payments on the mortgage after he received a letter from Chase acknowledging \nhis satisfaction of the mortgage. Cherry notified Chase of the error through a customer service \nrepresentative. Cherry, however, received a check dated August 15, 2000, as an escrow refund on the \nmortgage. Chase subsequently recorded a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the Pinellas County public records \non October 19, 2000. On November 14, 2000, Chase sent Cherry a “Loan Reactivation” letter with a new \nloan number upon which to make the payments. During this time, Cherry was placing his mortgage \npayments into a bank account, which subsequently were put into an escrow account maintained by his \nattorney. These payments were not, and have not, been tendered to Chase. As a result of the failure to \ntender, Chase sent Cherry an acceleration warning on November 17, 2000, and again on March 16, 2001. \nChase notified the credit bureaus as to Cherry’s default status and moved for foreclosure. In a letter \naddressed to Cherry’s attorney, dated April 24, 2001, Chase’s attorney advised Cherry to make the \nmortgage payments to Chase. Chase recorded a “vacatur, revocation, and cancellation of satisfaction of \nmortgage” (vacatur) [vacatur: an announcement filed in court that something is cancelled or set aside; an \nannulment] in the Pinellas County public records on May 3, 2001. Chase signed the vacatur on March 21, \n2001, and had it notarized on March 27, 2001. Chase has also been unable to locate the original note, \ndated October 15, 1997, and deems it to be lost.… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1100 \n \nForeclosure \n \nChase accelerated Cherry’s mortgage debt after determining he was in a default status under the mortgage \nprovisions. Chase claims that the right to foreclose under the note and mortgage is “absolute,” [Citation], \nand that this Court should enforce the security interest in the mortgage though Chase made an \nadministrative error in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the public records.… \n \nMortgage \n \n…Chase relies on the Florida Supreme Court decision in United Service Corp. v. Vi-An Const. Corp., \n[Citation] (Fla.1955), which held that a Satisfaction of Mortgage “made through a mistake may be \ncanceled” and a mortgage reestablished as long as no other innocent third parties have “acquired an \ninterest in the property.” Generally the court looks to the rights of any innocent third parties, and if none \nexist, equity will grant relief to a mortgagee who has mistakenly satisfied a mortgage before fully paid. \n[Citation]. Both parties agree that the mortgage was released before the debt was fully paid. Neither party \nhas presented any facts to this Court that implies the possibility nor existence of a third party interest. \nAlthough Cherry argues under Biggs v. Smith, 184 So. 106, 107 (1938), that a recorded satisfaction of \nmortgage is “prima facie evidence of extinguishment of a mortgage lien,” Biggs does not apply this \nstandard to mortgage rights affected by a mistake in the satisfaction. \n \nTherefore, on these facts, this Court acknowledges that a vacatur is a proper remedy for Chase to correct \nits unilateral mistake since “equity will grant relief to those who have through mistake released a \nmortgage.” [Citation.] Accordingly, this Court holds that an equity action is required to make a vacatur \nenforceable unless the parties consent to the vacatur or a similar remedy during the mortgage \nnegotiation.… \n \nTender \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1101 \nCherry has not made a mortgage payment to Chase since August 2000, but claims to have made these \npayments into an escrow account, which he claims were paid to the escrow account because Chase \nrecorded a satisfaction of his mortgage and, therefore, no mortgage existed. Cherry also claims that \nrepresentatives of Chase rejected his initial attempts to make payments because of a lack of a valid loan \nnumber. Chase, however, correctly argues that payments made to an escrow account are not a proper \ntender of payment.Matthews v. Lindsay, [Citation] (1884) (requiring tender to be made to the court). Nor \ndid Cherry make the required mortgage payments to the court as provided by [relevant court rules], \nallowing for a “deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether that party claims all or \nany part of the sum or thing.” Further, Chase also correctly argues that Cherry’s failure to tender the \npayments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court is more than just a “technical breach” \nof the mortgage and note.

In addition, the landlord/owner may be located far away and may own many properties, making \nit impractical for him to have direct involvement with the materialman. We find the landlord/owner or his \nagent is free to enter into a lease or agreement with a tenant which allows the tenant to direct the \nmodifications to the property which have been specifically consented to by the landlord/owner or his \nagent. \n \nWe hold a landlord/owner or his agent can give his consent to the lessee/tenant, as well as directly to the \nlien claimant, to make modifications to the leased premises. \n \nB. What Kind of Consent Is Necessary. \nThis Court has already clearly held the consent required by [the relevant section] is “something more than \na mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence. It implies an agreement to that which, but for \nthe consent, could not exist, and which the party consenting has a right to forbid.” [Citations.] However, \nour Mechanics Lien Statute has never been applied in the landlord-tenant context where a third party is \ninvolved. \n \nOther jurisdictions have addressed this issue. The Court of Appeals cited [a Connecticut case, 1987] in \nsupport of its holding. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Connecticut court’s reasoning is \npersuasive, especially since Connecticut has a similar mechanics lien statute.… \n \nThe Connecticut courts have stated “the consent required from the owner or one acting under the owner’s \nauthority is more than the mere granting of permission for work to be conducted on one’s property; or the \nmere knowledge that work was being performed on one’s land.” Furthermore, although the Connecticut \ncourts have stated the statute does not require an express contract, the courts have required “consent that \nindicates an agreement that the owner of…the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor.”… \n \nThe reasoning of [Connecticut and other states that have decided this issue] is persuasive. F & D’s brief \nappears to argue that mere knowledge by the landowner that the work needed to be done, coupled with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1108 \nthe landlord’s general “permission” to perform the work, is enough to establish consent under the statute. \nUnder this interpretation, a landlord who knew a tenant needed to improve, upgrade, or add to the leased \npremises would be liable to any contractor and/or subcontractor who performed work on his land. Under \nF & D’s interpretation the landlord would not be required to know the scope, cost, etc. of the work, but \nwould only need to give the tenant general permission to perform upgrades or improvements. \n \nClearly, if the landlord/owner or his agent gives consent directly to the materialman, a lien can be \nestablished. Consent can also be given to the tenant, but the consent needs to be specific. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent must know the scope of the project (for instance, as the lease provided in the \ninstant case, the landlord could approve written plans submitted by the tenant). The consent needs to be \nmore than “mere knowledge” that the tenant will perform work on the property. There must be some kind \nof express or implied agreement that the landlord may be held liable for the work or material. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent may delegate the project or work to his tenant, but there must be an express \nor implied agreement about the specific work to be done. A general provision in a lease which allows \ntenant to make repairs or improvements is not enough. \n \nC.

Sheth did not ask to re-open the \nbidding.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1113 \nSheth filed the current lawsuit, with Alpha as the sole plaintiff, on February 14, 2003. The lawsuit asked \nfor declaratory relief, restitution, and other damages. The trial court granted the defendants’ summary \njudgment motion on August 8, 2003. Alpha appeals. \n \nLocation of the Sale \n \nAlpha argues that the sale was improper because it was at the Third Avenue entrance, not the \nAdministration Building. Alpha points to a letter from a King County employee stating that auctions are \nheld at the Administration Building. The letter also stated that personnel were instructed to direct bidders \nand trustees to that location if asked. In addition, Alpha argues that the Third Avenue entrance was not a \n‘public’ place, as required by [the statute], since auction sales were forbidden there. We disagree. Alpha \nhas not shown that the Third Avenue entrance was an improper location. The evidence shows that the \ncounty had changed its policy as to where auctions would be held and had posted signs to that effect. \nHowever, the county did not exclude people from the Third Avenue entrance or prevent auctions from \nbeing held there. Street, who frequented sales, stated that auctions were being held in both locations. The \nsale was held where the Notice of Sale indicated it would be. In addition, Alpha has not introduced any \nevidence to show that the Third Avenue entrance was not a public place at the time of the sale. The public \nwas free to come and go at that location, and the area was ‘open and available for all to use.’ Alpha relies \non Morton v. Resolution Trust (S.D. Miss. 1995) to support its contention that the venue of the sale was \nimproper. [But] Morton is not on point. \n \nDuty to Re-Open Sale \nAlpha argues that Currin should have re-opened the sale. However, it is undisputed that Sheth did not \nrequest that Currin re-open it. The evidence indicates that Currin may have known about Sheth’s interest \nin bidding prior to the day of the sale, due to a conversation with Sheth’s attorney about Sheth’s desire to \nprotect his interest in the Property. But, this knowledge did not create in Currin any affirmative duty to \noffer to re-open the sale. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1114 \nIn addition, Alpha cites no Washington authority to support the contention that Currin would have been \nobligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked him to. The decision to continue a sale appears to be fully \nwithin the discretion of the trustee: “[t]he trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, \ncontinue the sale.” [Citation.] Alpha’s citation to Peterson v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., Missouri (1936) to \nsupport its contention that Currin should have re-opened the sale is unavailing. In Peterson, the Notice of \nSale indicated that the sale would be held at the ‘front’ door of the courthouse. But, the courthouse had \nfour doors, and the customary door for sales was the east door. The sheriff, acting as the trustee, \nconducted the sale at the east door, and then re-opened the sale at the south door, as there had been some \nsales at the south door. Alpha contends this shows that Currin should have re-opened the sale when \nlearning of the Administration Building location, akin to what the sheriff did in Peterson. However, \nPeterson does not indicate that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to re-sell the property at the south \ndoor. This case is not on point. \n \nChilled Bidding \nAlpha contends that Currin chilled the bidding on the Property by telling bidders that he expected a full \ncredit sale price and by holding the sale at the courthouse. Chilled bidding can be grounds for setting \naside a sale. Country Express Stores, Inc. v. Sims, [Washington Court of Appeals] (1997). TheCountry \nExpress court explained the two types of chilled bidding: \n \nThe first is intentional, occurring where there is collusion for the purpose of holding down the bids. The \nsecond consists of inadvertent and unintentional acts by the trustee that have the effect of suppressing the \nbidding. To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent.

Additionally, Currin’s statement to [an interested person who \nmight bid on the property] that a full credit sale price was expected and that the opening bid would be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1115 \n$4.1 million did not constitute intentional chilling. SFI was owed $4.1 million on the Property. SFI could \nthus bid up to that amount at no cost to itself, as the proceeds would go back to SFI. Currin confirmed that \nSFI was prepared to make a full-credit bid. [It is common for trustees to] disclose the full-credit bid \namount to potential third party bidders, and for investors to lose interest when they learn of the amount \nof indebtedness on property. It was therefore not a misrepresentation for Currin to state $4.1 million as \nthe opening bid, due to the indebtedness on the Property. Currin’s statements had no chilling effect—they \nmerely informed [interested persons] of the minimum amount necessary to prevail against SFI. Thus, \nCurrin did not intentionally chill the bidding by giving Street that information. \n \nAlpha also argues that the chilled bidding could have been unintended by Currin.… [But the evidence is \nthat] Currin’s actions did not intentionally or unintentionally chill the bidding, and the sale will not be set \naside. \n \nAdequacy of the Sale Price \nAlpha claims that the sale price was ‘greatly inadequate’ and that the sale should thus be set aside. Alpha \nsubmitted evidence that the property had an ‘as is’ value of $4.35 million in December 2002, and an \nestimated 2004 value of $5.2 million. The debt owed to SFI on the property was $4.1 million. SFI bought \nthe property for $2.1 million. These facts do not suggest that the sale must be set aside. \n \nWashington case law suggests that the price the property is sold for must be ‘grossly inadequate’ for a \ntrustee’s sale to be set aside on those grounds alone. In Cox [Citation, 1985], the property was worth \nbetween $200,000 and $300,000, and was sold to the beneficiary for $11,873. The Court held that \namount to be grossly inadequate In Steward [Citation, 1988] the property had been purchased for \napproximately $64,000, and then was sold to a third party at a foreclosure sale for $4,870. This court \nheld that $4,870 was not grossly inadequate. In Miebach [Citation] (1984), the Court noted that a sale for \nless than two percent of the property’s fair market value was grossly inadequate. The Court \nin Miebach also noted prior cases where the sale had been voided due to grossly inadequate purchase \nprice; the properties in those cases had been sold for less than four percent of the value and less than \nthree percent of the value. In addition, the Restatement indicates that gross inadequacy only exists when \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1116 \nthe sale price is less than 20 percent of the fair market value—without other defects, sale prices over 20 \npercent will not be set aside. [Citation.] The Property was sold for between 40 and 48 percent of its value. \nThese facts do not support a grossly inadequate purchase price. \n \nAlpha cites Miebach for the proposition that ‘where the inadequacy of price is great the sale will be set \naside with slight indications of fraud or unfairness,’ arguing that such indications existed here. However, \nthe cases cited by the Court in Miebach to support this proposition involved properties sold for less than \nthree and four percent of their value. Alpha has not demonstrated the slightest indication of fraud, nor \nshown that a property that sold for 40 to 48 percent of its value sold for a greatly inadequate price. \n \nDuty to a Junior Lienholder \nAlpha claims that Currin owed a duty to Alpha, the junior lienholder.

We begin with the rules \ngoverning proof of claims by creditors and the priority of their claims. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1131 \n \nClaims and Creditors \nA claim is defined as a right to payment, whether or not it is reduced to judgment, liquidated, \nunliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or \nunsecured. A creditor is defined as a person or entity with a claim that arose no later than when the court \nissues the order for relief. These are very broad definitions, intended to give the debtor the broadest \npossible relief when finally discharged. \n \nProof of Claims \nBefore the trustee can distribute proceeds of the estate, unsecured creditors must file a proof of claim, \nprima facie evidence that they are owed some amount of money. They must do so within six months after \nthe first date set for the first meeting of creditors. A creditor’s claim is disallowed, even though it is valid, \nif it is not filed in a timely manner. A party in interest, such as the trustee or creditor, may object to a \nproof of claim, in which case the court must determine whether to allow it. In the absence of objection, the \nclaim is “deemed allowed.” The court will not allow some claims. These include unenforceable claims, \nclaims for unmatured interest, claims that may be offset by debts the creditor owes the debtor, and \nunreasonable charges by an insider or an attorney. If it’s a “no asset” bankruptcy—most are—creditors are \nin effect told by the court not to waste their time filing proof of claim. \n \nClaims with Priority \nThe bankruptcy act sets out categories of claimants and establishes priorities among them. The law is \ncomplex because it sets up different orders of priorities. \n \nFirst, secured creditors get their security interests before anyone else is satisfied, because the security \ninterest is not part of the property that the trustee is entitled to bring into the estate. This is why being a \nsecured creditor is important (as discussed in Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and \nSuretyship\"and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual Liens\"). To the extent that secured creditors \nhave claims in excess of their collateral, they are considered unsecured or general creditors and are \nlumped in with general creditors of the appropriate class. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1132 \n \nSecond, of the six classes of claimants (see Figure 27.3 \"Distribution of the Estate\"), the first is known as \nthat of “priority claims.” It is subdivided into ten categories ranked in order of priority. The highest-\npriority class within the general class of priority claims must be paid off in full before the next class can \nshare in a distribution from the estate, and so on. Within each class, members will share pro rata if there \nare not enough assets to satisfy everyone fully. The priority classes, from highest to lowest, are set out in \nthe bankruptcy code (11 USC Section 507) as follows: \n \n(1) Domestic support obligations (“DSO”), which are claims for support due to the spouse, former \nspouse, child, or child’s representative, and at a lower priority within this class are any claims by \na governmental unit that has rendered support assistance to the debtor’s family obligations. \n \n(2) Administrative expenses that are required to administer the bankruptcy case itself. Under \nformer law, administrative expenses had the highest priority, but Congress elevated domestic \nsupport obligations above administrative expenses with the passage of the BAPCPA. Actually, \nthough, administrative expenses have a de facto priority over domestic support obligations, \nbecause such expenses are deducted before they are paid to DSO recipients. Since trustees are \npaid from the bankruptcy estate, the courts have allowed de facto top priority for administrative \nexpenses because no trustee is going to administer a bankruptcy case for nothing (and no lawyer \nwill work for long without getting paid, either). \n \n(3) Gap creditors. Claims made by gap creditors in an involuntary bankruptcy petition under \nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 are those that arise between the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy \npetition and the order for relief issued by the court. These claims are given priority because \notherwise creditors would not deal with the debtor, usually a business, when the business has \ndeclared bankruptcy but no trustee has been appointed and no order of relief issued. \n \n(4) Employee wages up to $10,950 for each worker, for the 180 days previous to either the \nbankruptcy filing or when the business ceased operations, whichever is earlier (180-day period). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1133",

Most bankruptcies are no-asset, \nso creditors get nothing. \n \nUnder Chapter 7’s 2005 amendments, debtors must pass a means test to be eligible for relief; if they make \ntoo much money, they must file Chapter 13. \n \nCertain property is exempt from the estate of an individual debtor. States may opt out of the federal list of \nexemptions and substitute their own; most have. \n \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable for most debts. However, some debts are not \ndischargeable, and bad faith by the debtor may preclude discharge. Under some circumstances, a debtor \nmay reaffirm a discharged debt. A Chapter 7 case may be converted to Chapter 11 or 13 voluntarily, or to \nChapter 11 involuntarily. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1172 \nChapter 11 provides for reorganization. Any person eligible for discharge in Chapter 7 is eligible for \nChapter 11, except stockbrokers and commodity brokers; those who have too much debt to file Chapter 13 \nand surpass the means test for Chapter 7 file Chapter 11. Under Chapter 11, the debtor retains possession \nof the business and may continue to operate it with its own management unless the court appoints a \ntrustee. The court may do so either for cause or if it is in the best interests of the creditors. The court must \nappoint a committee of unsecured creditors, who remain active throughout the proceeding. The debtor \nmay file its own reorganization plan and has the exclusive right to do so within 120 days if it remains in \npossession. The plan must be accepted by certain proportions of each impaired class of claims and \ninterests. It is binding on all creditors, and the debtor is discharged from all debts once the court confirms \nthe plan. \n \nChapter 13 is for any individual with regular income who has difficulty paying debts; it is voluntary only; \nthe debtor must get credit counseling. The debtor presents a payment plan to creditors, and the court \nappoints a trustee. The plan extends the time to pay and may reduce the size of the debt. If the creditors \nwind up with more in this proceeding than they would have in Chapter 7, the court is likely to approve the \nplan. The court may approve a stretch-out of five years. Some debts not dischargeable under Chapter 7 \nmay be under Chapter 13. \n \nAlternatives to bankruptcy are (1) composition (agreement by creditors to accept less than the face \namount of the debt), (2) assignment for benefit of creditors (transfer of debtor’s property to a trustee, who \nuses it to pay debts), and (3) receivership (a disinterested person is appointed by the court to preserve \nassets and distribute them at the court’s direction). Because these are voluntary procedures, they are \nineffective if all parties do not agree to them. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nDavid has debts of $18,000 and few assets. Because his debts are less than $25,000, he decides to file for \nbankruptcy using the state court system rather than the federal system. Briefly describe the procedure he \nshould follow to file for bankruptcy at the state level. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1173 \n2 \nAssume that David in Exercise 1 is irregularly employed and has developed a plan for paying off his \ncreditors. What type of bankruptcy should he use, Chapter 7, 11, or 13? Why? \n3 \nAssume that David owns the following unsecured property: a $3,000 oboe, a $1,000 piano, a $2,000 car, \nand a life insurance policy with a cash surrender value of $8,000. How much of this property is available \nfor distribution to his creditors in a bankruptcy? Explain. \n4 \nIf David owes his ex-wife alimony (maintenance) payments and is obligated to pay $12,000 for an \neducational loan, what effect will his discharge have on these obligations? \n5 \nAssume that David owns a corporation that he wants to liquidate under Chapter 7. After the corporate \nassets are distributed to creditors, there is still money owing to many of them. What obstacle does David \nface in obtaining a discharge for the corporation? \n6 \nThe famous retired professional football player—with a pension from the NFL—Orenthal James “O.J.” \nSimpson was convicted of wrongful death in a celebrated Santa Monica, California, trial in 1997 and \nordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to the families of the deceased. Mr. Simpson sold his California \nhouse, moved to Florida, and, from occasional appearances in the press, seemed to be living a high-style \nlife with a big house, nice cars, and sharp clothing.

The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\nand equity financing.\nInvestments\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students. Television programs such as Billions\nand movies such as Wall Street make investing appear glamorous, dangerous, shady, or intoxicating,\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n9\ndepending on the situation and the attitude of the viewer. In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.",

Issuing a mortgage can be profitable for a\nbank, but it also allows people to live in their own homes and to pay for them over time. Do MasterCard,\nVenmo, and PayPal make money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and\nsafer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track\nwhere and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to\ncapital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly\nbartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.\nThere are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides\na long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of\nfinancial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among\n2\nBrookings Institution. “Ben S.

Government and\nwork-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must\ntake greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let’s take a closer\nlook at some of the reasons why we study finance.\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may\npique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify\nyou for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in\nCareers in Finance.\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\nanalytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live. Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\nRisk and Return in Finance\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.",

Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\nBasic Data Types\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\n16\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Impact of Digitization\nData digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts\nout as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft Suite product. The Excel files and Word documents we create\nare ubiquitous and easily stored and transmitted. Cloud storage and video conferencing are now the norm.\nEmails and Zoom meetings are quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to share and store information. Businesses\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\nUses of Data\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\n1.\nMeasuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\n2.\nAiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\n3.\nAiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\n4.\nProviding data-supported strategic planning and visioning\n5.\nEnsuring consistent data and content across departments\n6.\nMotivating teams to set, meet, and exceed goals and objectives\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow and Why Managers Use Financial Statements: The Case of Peloton\nShould you lease a new car or buy one? Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a\nnew product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\napplying financial principles can help.\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular",

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell.

The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations.

They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs.

Defaulting on money\nmarket instruments is not unheard of, but it is very rare. “High liquidity” means that money market\ninstruments can generally be sold in a secondary market very quickly and at or near their current market\nvalue.

For example, if you purchase 13-week T-bills issued in the first week of January, each\nbill is identical to any other in the issue. Compare that to the purchase of physical assets such as a car or\nhouse, where each of the assets sold has some unique feature or measure of quality.\nFinancial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs\nissue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess\nof $100,000. These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements,\ncommercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too\nsmall to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs’ borrowing rates were affected by\nchanges in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and\nthey trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.\nTreasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where\ninvestors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills\nhas exceeded $75 billion.9\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as for inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to\n270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP\nmeans that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial\npaper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of\n2008.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue\ncommercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for\nCP. Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial\npaper until maturity.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.",

They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\nmaturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other\ntypes of deposits.\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve targets the equilibrium interest rate on\n9\nHenrik Bessembinder, Chester Spatt, and Kumar Venkataraman. “A Survey of the Microstructure of Fixed-Income Markets.”\nJournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds\ninterest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds\nmarket by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending\nrates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.\nCapital Markets and Instruments\nThe capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the\nmoney market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high, and\nliquidity is less certain, as is the homogeneity of the financial instruments. Broadly, we separate capital market\ninstruments into debt instruments traded in the bond markets and equity securities traded on the stock\nmarkets.\nThe federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to raise money for current spending and to repay\npast borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large, as the US federal government over the years\nhas accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion.10\nTreasury notes are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The Treasury auctions\nnotes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they\nwould a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest\npayments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and\ntiming of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change.\nLike T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for\nTreasury notes.\nLonger-term Treasury issues, Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (“munis”).\nLocal borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.\nThus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond\nrating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest\npayments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from",

In\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\nSome examples of these might include the following:\n•\nExpanding sales to existing customers\n•\nIncreasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\n•\nDeveloping new products for current and potential customers\n•\nBecoming international by setting up an online ordering service\nCorporate Structure and Governance\n2\n2 • Why It Matters\n39\n•\nImproving customer satisfaction with customer services\nIf managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in\nthe first place. One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that",

As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S",

Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\n48\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPepsiCo\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry. It has also been noted for its excellence in\ncorporate governance. Take a look at the PepsiCo website (https://openstax.org/r/pepsico). Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long\nway to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most",

This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate\nactions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,\nand ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\nInvestors versus Creditors\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\npossible default.\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\nstakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.\nIf such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the\norganization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the\ncompany as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus\nother stakeholders.\nA more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift\nbasket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.4 This was a direct result of the company\nbeing purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of\ndebt. However, the most important factor leading to the company’s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer,\nwho was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant\nexecutive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry & David has since emerged\nfrom bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen\nwhen stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate\nenvironment.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nInfamous Agency Problems\nEnron\nEnron is one particularly infamous example of an agency problem. Enron’s directors were responsible for\nprotecting and promoting investor interests, but they failed to carry out their regulatory and oversight\nresponsibilities, enabling the company to venture into illegal activity. The company’s resulting accounting\nscandal resulted in billions of dollars in losses to its investors.\nAt one time, Enron had been one of the largest companies in the United States. Despite being a multibillion-\n3\nAnshita Kohli. “Worldcom Scam: The Fall of the Biggest US Telecommunication Company.” The Company Ninja.

It had also started incurring a tremendous amount of\ndebt. Fearing a drop in stock prices, Enron’s management team tried to disguise the problems by\nmisrepresenting them through inappropriate accounting methods, which resulted in confusing and\nmisleading financial statements.\nDisaster started to unfold in 2001, when common stock prices fell from $90 to under $1 per share. The\ncompany filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, and criminal charges were brought against several key\nEnron employees, including former CEO Kenneth Lay and former CFO Andrew Fastow. Jeffrey Skilling was\nsubsequently named CEO in February 2001, but he ended up resigning six months later.\nBernard L.

Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any\ngulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it\nis recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also\nrecognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.\nImpact of ESG Ratings\nIn recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being\nevaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These ratings and\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal\nimportance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per Figure 2.3 below. It is critical for the senior management\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\nwhen necessary.\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\ncompany. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to\n2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards\n53\nrepresent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term\nvalue of company stock.\nThus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a\npoor rating can have a negative impact on a firm’s share price and result in substantial problems. In any case,\nit is important to note that ESG is only a starting point from which it is possible to gather indicators on a\nbusiness and its direction. In the end, it does not present the entire story of a firm. Any investment decisions\nabout the company in question should include a significant amount of additional data.\n2.5\nInteracting with Investors, Intermediaries, and Other Market Participants\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine the investor relations function.\n•\nDiscuss how the investor relations office interacts with investors, regulators, and other corporate\nstakeholders.\n•\nDescribe the topics most often discussed during a quarterly conference call.\n•\nExplain how press release information impacts company stock prices.\nInvestor Relations\nWithin the general field of corporate public relations is a specific subdivision referred to as investor relations\n(IR). IR involves elements of communication, marketing, and finance and is designed to control the flow of\ninformation from the management of a public corporation to its investors and stakeholders.\nBecause the investment community plays such a critical role in the overall growth and success of any\ncorporation, it is imperative that firms maintain strong and open relationships with their shareholder or\npotential investor audience. IR was developed to take responsibility for achieving and maintaining these\ncrucial relationships.\nInvestor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm’s IR group must work very\nclosely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team,\nsuch as the CEO and CFO.\nAs might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely\ndue to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and the International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRS). IR became significantly more important in 2002, when the United States Congress passed\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection",

For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported\nfrom other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because\nwe already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must\nsubtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation. Net exports equals exports from the United States minus\nimports from other countries. Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.\nHistorical Trends in GDP\nUS GDP over the past 70 years is represented by the blue line in Figure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced. The red line in Figure 3.12 represents the real GDP. Although its\ngrowth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70\nyears.\n5\n“GDP (Current US$): United States.” The World Bank. 2020. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n81\nFigure 3.12 Growth of the US GDP6 Gross domestic product (GDP), the featured measure of US output, is the market value of the\ngoods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States.

You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\n3.4 • Interest Rates\n87\ncredit risk. Lenders want to be rewarded for taking on this risk, so they charge a premium to borrowers who\nare higher risk.\nCompanies are more likely to go bankrupt and not be able to pay their bills on time than is the US\ngovernment. So, corporations have to pay a higher interest rate than the US government. If a lender can earn\n1% lending to the US government, the lender will only be willing to lend to the riskier corporation if they can\nearn more than 1%. In Figure 3.18, the interest rates paid by very creditworthy companies is shown. The prime\nrate is the interest rate that banks charge their very best customers—large companies that are financially very\nstrong and have a very low risk of default.\nIt is generally riskier for a lender to make a loan to an individual than to a corporation. Individuals are more\nlikely to become ill, lose their job, or experience some other financial setback that makes it difficult for them to\nrepay their loans. In Figure 3.18, the interest rate on credit card loans is much higher than the interest rate\ncharged to corporate borrowers. That is because credit card loans are a high risk to the lender. Unlike other\nloans made to an individual, such as a car loan, the credit card company has no collateral if a consumer cannot\npay back the loan. With car loans, if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed money, the lender can repossess\nthe automobile and sell it to recoup some of the money it is owed. If you use a credit card to buy groceries and\ndo not repay the loan, the credit card company cannot repossess the groceries that you purchased. Therefore,\ncredit card loans have notoriously high interest rates to compensate the lender for the high risk.\nFigure 3.18 Interest Rate on US Treasury Bills and Credit Cards11 This graph shows the rates posted by a majority of top 25 (by\nassets in domestic offices) insured US-chartered commercial banks.

However, the growth was not consistent from year to year.\nFigure 3.20 also contains information about Japanese real GDP from 2010 to 2020. This chart measures the\npercent change for each quarter on the vertical axis. It is created using the same underlying data as Figure\n3.19.

Looking at the percentage change in Figure 3.20 is helpful for\ndetecting when the economy is growing but the growth is slowing. If the percentage change is positive but\nlower than it was for the previous quarter, then GDP is growing, but the growth rate is slowing.\nIndexes\nAn index is created to track the performance of a particular aspect of the economy or the financial markets. An\nindex helps compare the level of a variable at one point in time relative to another point in time. Indexes are\noften used when movement over time is more important than the absolute level of the variable at any one\npoint in time.\nEarlier in this chapter, we looked at the rate of change in the CPI to measure the rate of inflation. In its raw\nform, the CPI is an index. Remember that the CPI is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods. When\nthe index is created, the total cost of the market basket, whether it is $300 or $950, is irrelevant. What\neconomists are interested in is the magnitude of the difference in cost of the same market basket at a later\ndate.\nIn order to focus on the change over time, a base year is identified.

Let’s assume that the market basket costs $300 in the base year. If the same\nbasket of goods costs $330 the following year, then the index level the following year would be 110. The index\nlevel increases by 10% when the cost of the market basket increases by 10%. This makes it easy to compare\ndifferent measures of inflation.\nFor example, suppose a market basket costs 40,000 yen in the first year and 42,000 yen in the second year. In\nthe base year, the CPI in Japan would be set at 100; the following year, the index would rise to 105 (because of\nthe 5% rise in the market basket cost). Comparing the levels of the index in Japan with the index in the United\nStates allows you to compare inflation trends in the two countries.\nTable 3.6 contains the CPI for the United States, Japan, and Switzerland for each decade since 1970. A base year\nof 1970 is used for all three countries, so the index level is 100 for all three countries in 1970. You can see that\nJapan has experienced virtually no inflation for the last several decades. If the index level remains the same\nfrom one year to the next, there is a zero rate of inflation. Negative rates of inflation, or deflation, would be\nassociated with a falling index level.\nYear United States Switzerland Japan\n1970\n100.0\n100.0\n100.0\n1980\n212.3\n162.3\n232.5\n1990\n336.5\n226.4\n291.2\n2000\n443.5\n278.2\n322.1\n2010\n561.6\n304.3\n313.6\n2020\n666.6\n302.3\n331.8\nTable 3.6 CPI Levels for the United States,\nSwitzerland, and Japan15\nUsing an index level helps us compare the impact that inflation has had on the cost of living in the three\ncountries.

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\nhave depreciated.\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. Over 765,000 time series of data are available. In addition to being viewable in\ngraphical and text form on the FRED site, the data is easily downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.\nKey Terms\nbusiness cycle\na period of economic expansion followed by economic contraction\nceteris paribus\nholding all other things constant\nconsumer price index (CPI)\na measure of inflation based on the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family of four might purchase\ncore inflation index\na measure of inflation that removes food and energy prices from the CPI\ndemand\nthe quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase during a given\ntime period, ceteris paribus\neconomic exposure\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s sales and number of\ncustomers\nequilibrium\nthe point at which the demand and supply curves for a good or service intersect\nequilibrium price\nthe price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\nexpansion\nthe part of the business cycle in which GDP is growing\n3 • Summary\n95\nGDP deflator\na measure of inflation tracked by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, intended to measure what\nGDP would be if prices did not change from one year to the next",

I’m a finance major. I won’t be spending my days recording entries and counting pennies. I’m\ndreading class today. I looked at the syllabus, we’re studying the accrual method. So what? Just give me the\nfinancial statements so I have the data I need.”\nEmma smiled at her friend and thought for a moment before responding. Emma loves the details of debits,\ncredits, and “all that other accounting jargon,” as Sam put it. She knows that while not everyone enjoys the\ndetails or understands them, they do play a big role in the timing and accuracy of financial statements. “Yeah,\nyeah, Sam, accounting isn’t always easy or fun, but it’s important. The financial statements you will use in\nfinance are a part of the foundation for many decisions. They are an important tool. Even though you don’t\nhave to create financial statements in a finance role, it’s still necessary to understand the accounting principles\nthey are based on. We haven’t covered the details yet, but I do know that income or loss in a period can be\nsignificantly different if the income statement is prepared under cash versus accrual methods. I would think\nthat would be important to know if you are the one using the income statement.”\nAccrual Accounting Process\n4\n4 • Why It Matters\n101\n4.1\nCash versus Accrual Accounting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nOutline the key concepts of the cash-basis accounting method.\n•\nExplain the key characteristics of the accrual-basis accounting method.\n•\nIdentify businesses for which cash accounting or accrual accounting is more appropriate.\nIn this section, we will explore the basic elements of cash and accrual accounting and the businesses that are\nmost likely to use each one. Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\nCash-Basis Accounting\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only",

In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based\naccounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.\nSo why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-\nbasis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from\nsuch requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?\nYou are a new accountant at a beauty salon. The salon had previously used cash-basis accounting to\nprepare its financial records but is now considering switching to an accrual-basis method. You have been\ntasked with determining if this transition is appropriate.\nWhen you go through the records, you notice that this transition will greatly impact how the salon reports\nrevenues and expenses. The salon will now report some revenues and expenses before it receives or pays\ncash.\nHow will this change positively impact its business reporting? How will it negatively impact its business\nreporting? If you were the accountant, would you recommend the salon transition from cash basis to\naccrual basis?\nSolution:\nAccrual accounting creates a more accurate picture of profit or loss, so the salon’s owner can have a better\nunderstanding of its profitability from period to period. However, it can be more work to record under\naccrual accounting. If the salon is small and the profits and costs are easily understood, it might not be\nworth the extra effort to the owner to use accrual-basis accounting. If the salon is seeking ways to better\nunderstand profits and costs, accrual-basis accounting would be a great choice.\n4.1 • Cash versus Accrual Accounting\n103\n4.2\nEconomic Basis for Accrual Accounting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nAssess the impact of business transactions on cash flow.\n•\nDefine double-entry accounting and explain how it supports the accounting equation.\nHow and when we record our transactions can have a significant impact on financial statements, especially the\nincome statement (net income). In this section you will explore the impact business transactions have on\nfinancial statements under each method. In doing so, you’ll be introduced to double-entry accounting and\nsee how it functions to support the accounting equation.\nTiming of Business Activity versus Cash Flow\nThe first financial statement prepared is the income statement, a statement that shows the organization’s\nfinancial performance for a given period of time. We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a\nsummer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used\nthe cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was\nusing her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance\ncosts. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.\nThis balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and\ninsurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\n104\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSeptember rather than in August. In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,\na result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,",

On the right, the same credit\nsale is recorded under the accrual basis of accounting.\nLet’s now explore the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting using an expense.\n108\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAssume a business purchases $160 worth of printing supplies from a supplier (vendor). Similar to a sale, a\npurchase of merchandise can be paid for at the time of sale using cash (also a check or credit card) or at a later\ndate (on account). A purchase paid with cash at the time of the sale would be recorded in the financial\nstatements under both cash basis and accrual basis of accounting. It makes sense because the business\nreceived the printing supplies from the supplier and paid the supplier at the same time. It is considered two\nevents that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nIf the purchase was made on account (also called a credit purchase), however, the transaction would be\nrecorded differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash basis of accounting, the $160\npurchase on account would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is paid, as stipulated by\nthe seller’s terms. For example, if the printing supplies were received on July 17 and the payment terms were\n15 days, no transaction would be recorded until August 1, when the goods were paid for. Under the accrual\nbasis of accounting, this purchase would be recorded in the financial statements at the time the business\nreceived the printing supplies from the supplier (July 17). The reason the purchase would be recorded is that\nthe business reports that it bought $160 worth of printing supplies from its vendors. The fact that the business\nwill pay later is viewed as a separate issue under accrual accounting. Table 4.1 summarizes these examples\nunder the different bases of accounting.\nTransaction\nUnder Cash-Basis Accounting\nUnder Accrual-Basis Accounting\n$200 sale for cash\nRecorded in financial statements at time of\nsale\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof sale\n$200 sale on\naccount\nNot recorded in financial statements until\ncash is received\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof sale\n$160 purchase for\ncash\nRecorded in financial statements at time of\npurchase\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof purchase\n$160 purchase on\naccount\nNot recorded in financial statements until\ncash is paid\nRecorded in financial statements at time\nof purchase\nTable 4.1 How Transactions Are Viewed under Cash and Accrual Accounting\nBusinesses often sell items for cash as well as on account, where payment terms are extended for a period of\ntime (for example, 30 to 45 days). Likewise, businesses often purchase items from suppliers (also called\nvendors) for cash or, more likely, on account. Under the cash basis of accounting, these transactions would not\nbe recorded until the cash is exchanged. In contrast, under accrual accounting, the transactions are recorded\nwhen the transaction occurs, regardless of when the cash is received or paid.\n4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\n109\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEthics in Revenue Recognition\nBecause each industry typically has a different method for recognizing income, revenue recognition is one\nof the most difficult tasks for accountants, as it involves a number of ethical dilemmas related to income\nreporting. To provide an industry-wide approach, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 and other\nrelated updates were implemented to clarify revenue recognition rules. The American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\nrevenue recognition.\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until",

However, since these financial statements\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing. For\n122\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexample, a customer may buy a good on account. Revenues would be recorded, but cash would not yet be\nreceived. The same is true on the expenses side. An expense can be incurred, such as an electric bill, but cash\nmay not have been paid out yet. Thus, an expense is recorded and recognized on the income statement, but\ncash has not yet been given up. The statement of cash flows helps reconcile the difference between net\nincome (a result of recorded revenues and expenses) and actual cash flow.\n4.5 • What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\n123\nSummary\n4.1 Cash versus Accrual Accounting\nCash-basis accounting records revenues and expenses only when cash is received or distributed. Accrual-basis\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\naccounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash\nbasis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.\n4.2 Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\nDouble-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts\nimpacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses. Thus a revenue does not\nnecessarily equal cash in, and an expense does not necessarily equal a cash flow out.\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual-basis accounting\nan accounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned\nyet not necessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily\nwhen paid\ncapitalize\nthe process in which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet and its allocated costs are\nexpensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life\ncash-basis accounting\na method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash\ncredit\na record of financial information on the right side of an account\ndebit\na record of financial information on the left side of each account\n124\n4 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndepreciation\nthe process of allocating the costs of a tangible asset over the asset’s economic life\ndouble-entry accounting\nan accounting method that requires the sum of the debits to equal the sum of the\ncredits for each transaction\nexpense\na cost associated with providing goods or services\nexpense recognition\n(also, matching principle) matches expenses with associated revenues in the period in\nwhich the revenues were generated\ngains\nincreases in organizational value from activities that are “incidental or peripheral” to the primary\npurpose of the business\nincome statement",

Dividends of $30,000 were paid to shareholders (found\non the statement of retained earnings and the statement of owner’s equity). Finally, we see that Clear Lake\nmust have issued additional common stock, as their common stock balance increased from $75,000 to $80,000.\nFigure 5.18 Financing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\n146\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStatement of Cash Flows\nVisit the Apple, Inc. Annual Report (https://openstax.org/r/2020-doc-financial-annual-report) for 2020 and\nlocate the company’s statement of cash flows (it begins on page 35). What is the cash provided by/used by\noperating activities? Review the key adjustments in the operating section. What are the biggest\nadjustments? Review the investing section of the statement. Did the company have a net cash inflow or net\ncash used by investing? What key items appear in this section? What was the net cash provided by or used\nby financing activities? What key items appear in this section for Apple?\nThe final task to wrap up the statement of cash flows is to tally net cash generated or used by summing all\nthree sections. This amount is then used to adjust the beginning cash balance from the balance sheet.\nAssuming the statement was prepared correctly, the sum should equal the ending cash balance on the\nbalance sheet.\nIn the full statement, we can see that Clear Lake has net cash flow of $20,000. The beginning cash balance was\n$90,000, making the ending cash balance $110,000 (see Figure 5.19).\nFigure 5.19 Full Statement of Cash Flows\nAnalyzing Performance\nThe statement of cash flows can be used in a number of ways to assess firm performance by both internal and\nexternal financial statement users. Internal users can assess sources of and uses of cash in order to aid in\nadapting, as necessary, to ensure adequate future cash flows. External users also use the statement. Recall\nthat comparing net income to operational cash flows can help assess the quality of earnings. In the next\nsection you’ll explore operating cash flow and free cash flow to the firm, two key points of analysis in\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n147\nassessing cash flows.\n5.6\nOperating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate operating cash flow and free cash flow.\n•\nAssess organizational cash management performance.\nOperating Cash Flow\nNow that we have a statement of cash flows prepared, we can move on to a few key elements of the statement\nused to assess organizational cash management performance. Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key",

It differs\ndepending on the role and perspective of those performing the analysis. For example, your personal\naccountant will have different goals and needs in making recommendations to you about your personal\nfinances. All accounting professionals use financial analysis to check for validity, accurate data, compliance in\nreporting, and more.\nSome tactics for managing your personal finances can be the same as for managing business finances. For\nexample, reducing expenses and maximizing returns on long-term investments are always good practices.\nDebt can also be a beneficial tool in both personal and professional finances when used appropriately. Debt is\nneither inherently good nor bad; it simply needs to be properly managed in order to achieve a reasonable\nreturn in exchange for the cost and risk it poses.\nThough the process and tools may be similar, financial analysis from a business perspective has different goals\nand needs. Investors are looking to identify firm performance, financial health, and profitability. Financial\nanalysts closely review information found on financial statements so they can make informed business\ndecisions. The income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows,\namong other financial information, are analyzed for internal and external stakeholders and provide a company\nwith valuable information about its overall performance and specific areas for improvement. The analysis can\nMeasures of Financial Health\n6\n6 • Why It Matters\n165\nhelp with budgeting and making decisions about where the company could cut costs, how it might increase\nrevenues, and what capital investment opportunities it should pursue.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFinancial Analyst\nLots of individuals and companies perform financial analysis. One of these roles is that of a financial\nanalyst.

An increasing earnings per share can drive up a stock price. Conversely, falling earnings per\nshare can lower a stock’s market price. Earnings per share is also a component in calculating the price-to-\nearnings ratio (the market price of the stock divided by its earnings per share), which many investors find to\nbe a key indicator of the value of a company’s stock.\nIt’s key to note, however, that EPS, like any ratio, should be used with caution and in tandem with other ratios\nand contextual data.

Both the balance\nsheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on\nthe preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares\noutstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\nearnings per share is\nBy removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to\ncommon shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to\npreferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While\na number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\nrequires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount\nappears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\nIn the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per\nshare is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout\nthe year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares\nis used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year\nwith 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period\nJanuary 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were\nissued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the\nnext nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\nfractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).",

It’s also helpful in evaluating how much investors are willing to pay for earnings performance.\nInvestors, in particular, use this ratio and rely on two key characteristics: past performance (trailing) and\nfuture estimates (forward). Trailing data can be calculated but is also easily found online, as it’s a common\nmeasure reported on financial sites. Investors will often look for P/E TTM, which is the price/earnings ratio for\nthe trailing 12 months (last year worth of earnings data). This helps investors assess one day’s stock price\nrelative to the earnings per share over the past 12 months. P/E ratio is widely used by investors to determine if\na stock is over- or undervalued. It also helps them compare one firm to that of the industry average or index,\nsuch as the S&P 500.\nIn the prior section we saw earnings per share data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Using its current year\nearnings per share of $3.75 and the current stock price of $69.41, we can calculate price/earnings ratio for\nClear Lake Sporting Goods:\nAn 18.51 ratio means an investor would expect to invest $18.51 to gain $1 of earnings.\nBook Value per Share\nBook value per share is often used hand in hand with market value per share. Investors compare the two in\norder to see if the stock is possibly over- or undervalued. Book value is derived from accounting practices and\nshows the value of the firm on paper. Market value, on the other hand, is determined by supply and demand,\nbased on what investors are willing to pay for the stock. If the market value per share is higher than the book\nvalue, the stock is considered overvalued. If the market value is lower than the book value, it’s considered\nundervalued.\nIn theory, book value per share represents the total value common shareholders would receive if the firm\nwere liquidated. It is total equity less preferred equity, spread across the total shares outstanding. The formula\nto calculate book value per share is\nThe book value per share for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is\nIf investors compared the book value per share of $10.00 for Clear Lake Sporting Goods to the P/E ratio of\n$18.51, they would likely conclude that the stock was undervalued in the year of analysis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nBook Value versus Market Value of Shares\nThis video about book value and market value (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-book-value) explains\nthe basic concepts and discusses how the two differ. Samples of the concept are then explored using Apple\nInc. as an example.\n6.5 • Market Value Ratios\n181\n6.6\nProfitability Ratios and the DuPont Method\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCalculate profit margin to determine how much sales revenues the firm has translated into income.\n•\nEvaluate firm performance by calculating return on total assets and return on equity.\n•\nAnalyze organizational performance using DuPont method calculations.\nProfitability considers how well a company produces returns given its operational performance. The company\nneeds to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,\ncompany revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:\nprofit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.\nProfit Margin\nProfit margin represents how much of sales revenue has translated into income. This ratio shows how much\nof each $1 of sales is returned as profit. The larger the ratio figure (the closer it gets to 1), the more of each\nsales dollar is returned as profit. The portion of the sales dollar not returned as profit goes toward expenses.\nThe formula for profit margin is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the profit margin in the current year is\nThis means that for every dollar of sales, $0.29 returns as profit. If Clear Lake Sporting Goods thinks this is too\nlow, the company would try to find ways to reduce expenses and increase sales.\nReturn on Total Assets\nThe return on total assets measures the company’s ability to use its assets successfully to generate a profit.\nThe higher the return (ratio outcome), the more profit is created from asset use. Average total assets are\nfound by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the balance sheet. The\nbeginning total assets balance in the current year is taken from the ending total assets balance in the prior\nyear. The formula for return on total assets is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the return on total assets for the current year is\nThe higher the figure, the better the company is using its assets to create a profit. Industry standards can\ndictate what an acceptable return is.\n182\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReturn on Assets",

The video provides the formula, a discussion of the concept, and\nthe importance of the ratio.\nReturn on Equity\nReturn on equity measures the company’s ability to use its invested capital to generate income. The invested\ncapital comes from stockholders’ investments in the company’s stock and its retained earnings and is\nleveraged to create profit. The higher the return, the better the company is doing at using its investments to\nyield a profit. The formula for return on equity is\nAverage stockholders’ equity is found by dividing the sum of beginning and ending stockholders’ equity\nbalances found on the balance sheet. The beginning stockholders’ equity balance in the current year is taken\nfrom the ending stockholders’ equity balance in the prior year. Keep in mind that the net income is calculated\nafter preferred dividends have been paid.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we will use the net income figure and deduct the preferred dividends that have\nbeen paid. The return on equity for the current year is\nThe higher the figure, the better the company is using its investments to create a profit. Industry standards\ncan dictate what an acceptable return is.\nThe DuPont Method\nROE in its basic form is useful; however, there are really three components of ROE: operating efficiency (profit\nmargin), asset usage (total asset turnover), and leverage (equity ratio). This is known as the DuPont method.\nIt originated in 1919 when the DuPont company implemented it for internal measurement purposes.2 The\nDuPont method can be expressed using this formula:\nProfit margin indicates how much profit is generated by each dollar of sales and is computed as shown:\nTotal asset turnover indicates the number of sales dollars produced by every dollar invested in capital\nassets—in other words, how efficiently the company is using its capital assets to generate sales. It is computed\nas shown:\n2\nJoshua Kennon. “What Is the DuPont Method Return on Equity, or ROE, Formula?” The Balance.

A good sales margin and a proper asset turnover are both\nneeded for a successful operation. Like all ratios, assessing performance is relative. It’s important to look at\nthe ratio in context of the organization, its history, and the industry.

The interest rate is often referred to as the growth rate, or the annual percentage increase on\nsavings or on an investment. When the rate is raised to the power of the number of periods, the formula\nwill yield a number that is commonly referred to as the future value interest factor (FVIF). As a result\nof this process, as n (time, or the number of periods) increases, the future value interest factor will increase.\nAlso, as r (interest rate) increases, the FVIF will increases. For these reasons, the future value calculation is\ndirectly determined by both the interest rate being used and the total amount of time—specifically, the\nnumber of periods—being considered.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Future Values\nHere’s another example of calculating future values in multiple-period scenarios.\nOn a recent drive, you spotted your dream home, which is currently listed at $400,000. Unfortunately, you\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\ncost after six years?\nSolution:\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\nvalue of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn\nor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of\nor $105, in the account at the end of one\nyear.\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\nand five?\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n195\nUsing the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:\nHow the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding\nMelvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in\ninterest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future. His friend suggests finding an\naccount or some form of investment with a greater interest rate than the 5% he can get at his local bank.\nMelvin thinks he can leave his money in an account or investment for a total of five years. He found\ninvestments that will provide annual returns of 6%, 7%, 10%, and 12%. Using the\nformula, we can complete the following calculations for him:\nAgain, Melvin likes this information, and he states that he will try to find the highest interest rate available. This\nmakes sense, but it’s important to remember that investments are usually not guaranteed to earn you specific\ninterest rates, or rates of return. Most investments, other than Treasury investments such as Treasury bonds,\ncarry some form of financial risk, either small or large, and the greater the rate of return, the more likely it is\nthat the risk associated with the investment will also be greater. This risk does not have any effect on the\nfuture calculations we have just completed, but it an important factor to bear in mind and consider well before\nmoving ahead and putting your money in any investment or financial instrument.\n7.3\nMethods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how future dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nExplain how present dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how discount rates are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how growth rates are calculated.\n•\nIllustrate how periods of time for specified growth are calculated.\n•\nUse a financial calculator and Excel to solve TVM problems.\nWe can determine future value by using any of four methods: (1) mathematical equations, (2) calculators with\nfinancial functions, (3) spreadsheets, and (4) FVIF tables. With the advent and wide acceptance and use of\nfinancial calculators and spreadsheet software, FVIF (and other such time value of money tables and factors)\nhave become obsolete, and we will not discuss them in this text.

Figure 7.18 demonstrates the decline in the purchasing power of\nthe consumer dollar over the 13-year period from 2007 to 2020.\nWith this in mind, we can work with the TVM formula and use it to help determine the present value of money\nyou have in hand today, as well as how this same amount of money may be valued at any specific point in the\nfuture and at any specific rate of interest.\nFigure 7.18 Historical Purchasing Power Decline as a Result of Inflation, 2007–2020 (data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\nThe Relationship between TVM and Inflation\nAs we have seen, the future value formula can be very helpful in calculating the value of a sum of cash (or any\nliquid asset) at some future point in time. One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it\nis preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when\ninflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending\nmoney later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing\npower of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move\ninto the future.\nMost investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a\npayment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general\nprices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of\nnormal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value\nof financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\nmay be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than\ninflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.\nConversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\nas time goes by under such conditions.\nThe Impact of Inflation on TVM\nThe difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the\neffects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods\nand services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that\nincreasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services\navailable will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services. When more\nmoney is created and made available to the consuming public, the value of each unit of currency will diminish.\n216\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThis will then have the effect of incentivizing consumers to spend their money now, or in the very near future,\ninstead of saving cash for later use. Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to\nincreased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the\ncosts of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\nConsumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it\nnow, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a\ndecision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\ninflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in\ntimes when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing\npower erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\nnow in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through\ninterest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\nLower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed\nas the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on\nto sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money\nless expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and\nservices they may require. We have also seen that the more quickly inflation rates rise, the more quickly the",

This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples\nwe have already covered. In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\nrate. Note that we represent r as the interest paid per period\nand n as the number\nof periods (12 months in a year;\n) rather than the number of years, which is only one.\nContinuing with our example, that same $1,000 in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four\ntimes a year, would grow to\nin one year. Note that this final amount ends up\nbeing greater than the annually compounded future value of $1,060.00 and slightly less than the monthly\n218\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompounded future value of $1.061.67, which would appear to make logical sense.\nThe total differences in future values among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding in these examples\nare insignificant, amounting to less than $1.70 in total. However, when working with larger amounts, higher\ninterest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms, compounding periods and frequency\nbecome far more important and can generate some exceptionally large differences in future values.\nTen million dollars at 12% growth for one year and compounded annually amounts to\n, while 10 million dollars on the same terms but compounded quarterly will\nproduce\n. Most wealthy and rational investors and savers would be\nvery pleased to earn that additional $55,088.10 by simply having their funds in an account that features\nquarterly compounding.\nIn another example, $200 at 60% interest, compounded annually for six years, becomes\n, while this same amount compounded quarterly grows to\n.\nAn amount of $1 at 3%, compounded annually for 100 years, will be worth\n. The same\ndollar at the same interest rate, compounded monthly over the course of a century, will grow to\n.\nThis would all seem to make sense due to the fact that in situations when compounding increases in\nfrequency, interest income is being received during the year as opposed to at the end of the year and thus\ngrows more rapidly to become a larger and more valuable sum of money. This is important because we know\nthrough the concept of TVM that having money now is more useful to us than having that same amount of\nmoney at some later point in time.\nThe Rule of 72\nThe rule of 72 is a simple and often very useful mathematical shortcut that can help you estimate the impact of\nany interest or growth rate and can be used in situations ranging from financial calculations to projections of\npopulation growth. The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time\nto double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth\nrate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not\nas a percentage. So, as a result, we have\nThis formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for\nunderstanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary\nbalance.\nFollowing are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very",

Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%\ndividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out\n$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of\ncontinuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in\nperpetuity.\nTo place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one\nshare of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that\none share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But\nbe careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but the required rate of return, the “market\nrate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk. We must also note an important fact affecting all\n228\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninvestment valuations: the value of an investment generally represents our expectations of all future cash\nflows from that investment, discounted to today’s dollars.\nBecause a perpetuity is a stream of payments continuing indefinitely, determining the future value isn’t\npossible. Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity? Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\nBy substitution,\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend\nof $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what\nprice should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is\n, or $30.17.",

We are also interested in how to project the future value of a series of payments. In this case, an\ninvestment may be made periodically. Keeping with the definition of an annuity, if the amount of periodic\ninvestment is always the same, we may take a one-step shortcut to calculate the future value of that stream by\nusing the formula presented below:\nwhere FVa is the future value of the annuity, PYMT is a one-time payment or receipt in the series, r is the\ninterest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nAs we did in our section on present values of annuities, we will begin with an ordinary annuity and then\nproceed to an annuity due.\nLet’s assume that you lock in a contract for an investment opportunity at 4% per year, but you cannot make\nthe first investment until one year from now.

You plan to\ninvest $3,000 at the end of each year.

Therefore, the amount only\ncompounds for four years rather than five. Also, our fifth payment is not made until the last day of our\ncontract in year 5, so it has no chance to earn a compounded future value. The investor has lost on both ends.\nIn the table above, we have made five calculations, and for a longer-term contract such as 10, 25, or 40 years,\nthis would be tedious. Fortunately, as with present values, this ordinary annuity can be solved in one step\nbecause all payments are identical.\nRepeating the formula, and then by substitution:\nThis proof emphasizes that year 1 is wasted, with no compounding because the payment is made on the last\nday of year 1 rather than immediately. We lose compounding through this ordinary annuity in another way:\nyear 5’s investment is made on the last day of this five-year contract and has no chance to accumulate interest.\nA more intuitive method would be to enter a contract for an annuity due so that our first payment can be\nmade immediately. In this way, we don’t waste the first year, and all five payments work in year 5 as well. As\nstated previously, this means that annuities due will yield larger results than ordinary annuities, whether one is\ndiscounting (PVa) or compounding (FVa).\nLet’s hold all facts constant with the previous example, except that we will invest at the beginning of each year,\nstarting immediately upon locking in this five-year contract. We follow the same technique as in the present\nvalue section: we multiply by one additional period to convert this ordinary annuity factor into a factor for an\nannuity due. Whether one is solving for a future value or a present value, the result of an annuity due must\nalways be larger than an ordinary annuity. With future value, we begin investing immediately, so the result will\nbe larger than if we waited for a period to elapse. With present value, we begin extracting funds immediately\nrather than letting them work for us during the first year, so logically we would have to start with more.\nContinuing our example but converting it to an annuity due, we will multiply by one additional period, (1 + i).\nAll else remains the same:\nLet’s provide one additional example of each. Assume that you have a chance to invest $15,000 per year for 10\nyears, earning 8% compounded annually. What amount would you have after the 10 years?

In addition, the debt is decreasing slowly in the early months and more rapidly in the later\n8.3 • Loan Amortization\n241\nmonths. We can all agree that lenders are compensated for the risks they take earlier rather than later. Of the\n36 payments of $973.50, $32,000 has been repaid as the principal borrowed. The remaining $3,046.08 is the\nlender’s revenue, the cost of credit.\nFor an additional example, one that drives home the point that more interest is paid in the early months of a\nlong-term loan, we will consider a 20-year home mortgage. Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance. Let’s assume you buy a $200,000 home, pay $60,000 as a cash deposit, and will finance the\nremaining $140,000 over 20 years. The bank offers you a 3.6% annual interest rate. What will the amount of\nyour monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s\nprove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of\nan annuity formula. Remember that you are not financing the entire $200,000 purchase; you pay $60,000 in\ncash, so you are only financing the remaining $140,000.\nWe modify the periods from years to months by multiplying by 12, and we modify the annual rate to a monthly\nrate by dividing by 12, resulting in\nBy substitution into the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe divide both sides by 170.907667 to isolate the payment amount (PYMT):\nYour monthly mortgage payment is $819.16.

Yet while mastery of Excel requires extensive study and practice, enough\nbasics can be learned in two or three hours to provide the user with the ability to solve problems quickly and\nconveniently, including extensive financial capability. Most of the calculations in this chapter were prepared\nwith Excel.\nThe boxes in the Excel gridwork, known individually as cells (located at the intersection of a column and a row),\ncan contain numbers, text, and very powerful formulas (or functions) for calculations and data analytics. Cells,\nrows, columns, and groups of cells (ranges) are easily moved, formatted, and replicated. In the mortgage\namortization table for 240 months seen in Section 8.3.2, only the formulas for month 1 were typed in. With one\nsimple command, that row of formulas was replicated 239 more times, with each line updating itself with\nrelevant number adjustments automatically. With some practice, a long table such as that can be constructed\nby even a relatively new user in less than 10 minutes.\nIn this section, we will illustrate how to use Excel to solve problems from earlier in the chapter, including\nperpetuities, ordinary annuities, effective interest rates, and loan amortization. We will omit the basic\ndynamics of an Excel spreadsheet because they were presented sufficiently in preceding chapters.\nRevisiting the constant perpetuity from Section 8.1, in which our shares of Shaw Inc., preferred stock pay an\nannual fixed dividend of $2.00 and the required rate of return is 7%, we do not use an Excel function for this\nsimple operation.

You will draw $25,000 at the end of\neach year for five years from a fund earning 8% annually, and you want to know how much you need in that\nfund today to accomplish this. We accomplish this in Excel easily with the PV function. The format of the PV\ncommand is\n=PV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nOnly the first three arguments inside the parentheses are used. We’ll place them in cells and refer to those\ncells in our PV function. As an option, you could also type the numbers into the parentheses directly. Notice\nthe slight rounding error because of decimal expansion. Also, the payment must be entered as a negative\nnumber for your result to be positive; this can be accomplished either by making the $25,000 in cell B5 a\nnegative amount or by placing a minus sign in front of the B5 in the formula’s arguments. In cell B3, you must\nenter the percent either as 0.08 or as 8% (with the percent sign). We repeated the formula syntax and the\nactual formula inputs in column A near the result, for your reference (see Figure 8.3).\nFigure 8.3 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nWe also found the present value of an annuity due. We use the same information from the ordinary annuity\nproblem above, but you will recall that the first of five payments happens immediately at the start of year 1,\nnot at the end. We follow the same procedures and inputs as in the previous example, but with one change to\nthe PV function: the last argument in the parentheses will change from 0 to 1. This is a toggle switch that\ncommands the PV function to treat this as an annuity due instead of an ordinary annuity (see Figure 8.4).\n250\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.4 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nSection 8.2 introduced us to future values. Comparable to the PV function above, Excel provides the FV\nfunction. Using the same information—$3,000 invested annually for five years, starting one year from now, at\n4%—we’ll solve using Excel (see Figure 8.5). The format of the command is\n=FV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nFigure 8.5 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nAs with present values, using the same data but solving for an annuity due requires the fifth argument inside\nthe parentheses to be changed from 0 to 1; all other values remain the same (see Figure 8.6).\nFigure 8.6 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Annuity Due\nIn Section 8.4, we explained the difference between stated and effective rates of interest to show the true cost\nof borrowing, in this case for a one-year period, if interest is compounded for periods within a year.

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments\navailable to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,\nBonds and Bond Valuation\n10\n10 • Why It Matters\n283\nadding a degree of safety and diversity to their investment mix.\n10.1\nCharacteristics of Bonds\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nList and define the basic characteristics of bonds.\n•\nList and describe the various types of bonds available.\n•\nExplain how a bond price is inversely related to its return (yield).\nBonds as Investments\nOne way to look at bond investments is to consider the fact that any investor who purchases a bond is\nessentially buying a future cash flow stream that the bond issuer (or borrower) promises to make as per\nagreement.\nBecause bonds provide a set amount of cash inflow to their owners, they are often called fixed-income\nsecurities. Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•\nPar value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284",

The final column gives the bond rating, a grade that indicates credit quality. As we\nprogress through this chapter, we will examine prices, coupon rates, yields, and bond ratings in more\ndetail\nTypes of Bonds\nThere are three primary categories of bonds, though the specifics of these different types of bond can vary\ndepending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest rate, and risk.\nGovernment Bonds\nThe safest category of bonds are short-term US Treasury bills (T-bills). These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGovernment Bonds\nReview this introductory video (https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices) about government bonds.\nMunicipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors. Though the global fixed-income debt\nmarket remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond\nmarkets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some\nexperts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only\n(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.\nThe chart in Figure 10.2 provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own\nconclusions about these markets.\nFigure 10.2 Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020 (data source: Nasdaq)\nWhile the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past\nseveral years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.",

This is because yields on\nfixed-income investments such as bonds will rise as maturity periods increase and produce greater levels of\nrisk.\nCorporate issuers of bonds will usually offer bond issues at higher yields that the government, which is\nunderstandable because they are potentially riskier for investors. Government securities are guaranteed by\ngovernments and have little to no chance of default or nonpayment. This is not the case for corporate bonds,\nwhere there is always a chance of default, though the likelihood of this occurring will vary by individual\ncompany or issuer as well as by bond type and term. We will discuss bond default and default risk next.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Yield Curve\nReview this video (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-the-yield-curve) that introduces the concept of\nthe yield curve.\n10.3 • Using the Yield Curve\n297\nDifferent Shapes of the Yield Curve\nThere are two important elements to any yield curve that will define its shape: its level and its slope. The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-\nincome investments, such as the purchase of bond issues. Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a\nnegative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but\nthe curve inverted in March 2019 as yields on short-term bonds exceeded those of longer-term bonds,\nresulting in concerns surrounding impending recession and other economic problems. This inverted shape\nto the yield curve continued into 2020, as evidenced in Figure 10.9.\nFigure 10.8 The Economy Shifts to an Inverted Yield Curve (data source: US Department of the Treasury, Resource Center,\nDaily Treasury Yield Curve Rates)\nYield curves constructed on different days in early 2020 appeared similar to the examples below.

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to\nissue them to raise capital. In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political\nmovement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets.

These are important concepts for any investor who considers putting their money in fixed-income\nsecurities such as bonds.\n7\nDouglas O. Linder. “Enron (Lay & Skilling) Trial (2006).” Famous Trials.

The coupon rate of a\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor\npurchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive\n20 coupon payments equal to\nor\nfor a total of $1,000.\nDepending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation\nresulting in significant realized return for the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could",

Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they\nwould earn by only investing in short-term bonds. Also, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced\nby the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making the bond ladder less risky than an investment\nthat only included long-term bonds.\nIt is easy to see why bond laddering has become such a highly adopted bond investment strategy with\ninvestors ranging from novice to the most well-seasoned and experienced.\nInterest Rate Movements and Bond Prices\nWe now know that when investors buy bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are lending money\nto bond-issuing firms or governments. In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated\ncoupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.\nWe have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest\nrates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDemonstrate bond valuations using Excel.\n•\nDemonstrate bond yield calculations using Excel.\nCalculating the Price (Present Value) of a Bond\nThe following examples illustrate how Microsoft Excel can be used to calculate common bond problems.\nPlease be sure to refer to the chapters on the time value of money for examples of using spreadsheets to solve\npresent value problems, as these same concepts are also used in solving bond problems.\nYou can use the following steps in Excel to determine the price or present value of a coupon bond.

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call\na feature of certain bonds or other fixed-income instruments that allows the issuer to repurchase\nand retire these instruments before maturity\nbond price\nthe present, discounted value of the future cash stream generated by a bond; the sum of the\npresent values of all likely coupon payments and the present value of the par value at maturity\nbond ratings\ngrades assigned to bonds by rating services that indicate their overall credit quality\nBusiness Cycle Dating Committee\na subdivision of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the\nUS government agency that maintains a chronology of US business cycles\ncall risk",

However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by\ncompanies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate\nincome and eventual value for individual investors.\nWith common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will\nreceive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•\nStocks are a liquid form of investment and can be bought or sold within secondary markets relatively\neasily.\n•\nInformation about companies, markets, and important trends are widely published and readily available\nto the investing public.\nThese advantages are significant and lead many individuals to move into stock investments. Yet it is important\nto realize that stock has some significant disadvantages, which can include the following:\n•\nGeneral risk levels are greater than with bonds or other fixed-income investments.\n•\nTiming the buy-and-sell transactions of stock can be tricky and may lead to losses or not taking full\nadvantage of share price opportunities.\n•\nDividends (provided that the stock does indeed pay them, as not all do) are uncertain and subject to\nchange based on decisions of company management.",

This is also an unrealistic\nassumption that can present problems when attempting to evaluate companies such as Amazon, Facebook,\nGoogle, or other organizations that do not pay dividends. Constant growth models are most often used to\nvalue mature companies whose dividend payments have steadily increased over a significant period of time.\nWhen applied, the constant growth DDM will generate the present value of an infinite stream of dividends that\nare growing at a constant rate.\nThe constant growth DDM formula is\nwhere D0 is the value of the dividend received this year, D1 is the value of the dividend to be received next\nyear, g is the growth rate of the dividend, and r is the required rate of return.\nAs can be seen above, after simplification, the constant growth DDM formula becomes the Gordon growth\nmodel formula and works in the same way. Let’s look at some examples.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nConstant Growth DDM: Example 1\nIf a stock is paying a dividend of $5.00 this year and the dividend has been steadily growing at 4% annually,\nwhat is the intrinsic value of the stock, assuming an investor’s required rate of return of 8%?\nSolution:\nApply the constant growth DDM formula:\nSimplify to the Gordon growth model:\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n327\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nConstant Growth DDM: Example 2\nIf a stock is selling at $250 with a current dividend of $10, what would be the dividend growth rate of this\nstock, assuming a required rate of return of 12%?\nSolution:\nApply the constant growth DDM formula:\nSimplify and continue the calculation:\nSo, the growth rate is 7.69%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDividend Discount Model: A Complete Animated Guide\nIn this video for the Investing for Beginners course and podcast, Andrew Sather introduces the DDM,\n(https://openstax.org/r/Andrew_Sather_introduces_the_DDM) demonstrating both the constant growth\nDDM (Gordon growth model) and the two-stage DDM.\nVariable or Nonconstant Growth Dividend Discount Model\nMany experienced analysts prefer to use the variable (nonconstant) growth DDM because it is a much closer\napproximation of businesses’ actual dividend payment policies, making it much closer to reality than other\nforms of DDM. The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward. What is the present value of the stock if\nthe required rate of return is 8%?

Many analysts like to use the\ntwo-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable\nassumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level\nof, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will\nmaintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of\ndividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.\nAs we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:\n•",

Based on the current dividend value of $14 and the anticipated growth rate of 13%, the values of\ndividends (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5) can be determined for each year of the first phase. Because the stable growth\nrate is achieved in the second phase, after five years have passed, if we assume that the current year is 2021,\nwe can lay out the profile for this stock’s dividends through the year 2026, as per Figure 11.3.\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n329\nFigure 11.3 Profile of Stock Dividend through 2026\nStep 2:\nNext, we apply the DDM to determine the terminal value, or the value of the stock at the end of the five-year\nhigh-growth phase and the beginning of the second, lower growth-phase.\nWe can apply the DDM formula at any point in time, but in this example, we are working with a stock that has\nconstant growth in dividends for five years and then decreases to a lower growth rate in its secondary phase.\nBecause of this timing and dividend structure, we calculate the value of the stock five years from now, or the\nterminal value. Again, this is calculated at the end of the high-growth phase, in 2026. By applying the constant\ngrowth DDM formula, we arrive at the following:\nThe terminal value can be calculated by applying the DDM formula in Excel, as seen in Figure 11.4 and Figure\n11.5. The terminal value, or the value at the end of 2026, is $386.91.\nFigure 11.4 Terminal Value at the End of 2026 (Showing Formula)\nFigure 11.5 Terminal Value at the End of 2026\nStep 3:\n330\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNext, we find the PV of all paid dividends that occur during the high-growth period of 2022–2026. This is shown\nin Figure 11.6. Our required rate of return (discount rate) is 12%.\nFigure 11.6 Present Value of All Paid Dividends, 2022–2026\nStep 4:\nNext, we calculate the PV of the single lump-sum terminal value:\nRemember that due to the sign convention, either the FV must be entered as a negative value or, if entered as\na positive value, the resulting PV will be negative. This example shows the former.\nStep 5:\nOur next step is to find the current fair (intrinsic) value of the stock, which comprises the PV of all future\ndividends plus the PV of the terminal value. This is represented in the following formula, with all factors shown\nin Figure 11.7:\nFigure 11.7 Fair Value of the Stock\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n331\nSo, we end up with a total current fair value of Lore Ltd. stock of $291.44 (due to Excel’s rounding), although\nthe sum can also be calculated as shown below:\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDetermining Stock Value\nTake a few minutes to review this video, which covers methods used to determine stock value\n(https://openstax.org/r/covers_methods_used_to_determine_stock_value) when dividend growth is\nnonconstant.\nAdvantages and Limitations of DDMs\nSome of the primary advantages of DDMs are their basis in the sound logic of present value concepts, their\nconsistency, and the implication that companies that pay dividends tend to be mature and stable entities. Also,\nbecause the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or\nsubjectivity. As a result of these advantages, DDMs are a very popular form of stock evaluation that most\nanalysts show faith in.\nBecause dividends are paid in cash, companies may keep making their dividend payments even when doing so\nis not in their best long-term interests. They may not want to manipulate dividend payments, as this can",

            "chunk": "words, we want to know whether markets are efficient. By efficient markets, we mean markets in which costs\nare minimal and prices are current and fair to all traders. To answer our questions, we will look at two forms of\nefficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency.\nOperational Efficiency\nOperational efficiency concerns the speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available\nprice. Through the years, the competitive nature of the market has promoted operational efficiency.\nIn the past, the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) used a designated-order turnaround computer system\nknown as SuperDOT to manage orders. SuperDOT was designed to match buyers and sellers and execute\ntrades with confirmation to both parties in a matter of seconds, giving both buyers and sellers the best\n11.5 • Efficient Markets\n345\navailable prices. SuperDOT was replaced by a system known as the Super Display Book (SDBK) in 2009 and\nsubsequently replaced by the Universal Trading Platform in 2012.\nNASDAQ used a process referred to as the small-order execution system (SOES) to process orders. The\npractice for registered dealers had been for SOES to publicly display all limit orders (orders awaiting execution\nat specified price), the best dealer quotes, and the best customer limit order sizes. The SOES system has now\nbeen largely phased out with the emergence of all-electronic trading that increased transaction speed at ever\nhigher trading volumes.\nPublic access to the best available prices promotes operational efficiency. This speed in matching buyers and\nsellers at the best available price is strong evidence that the stock markets are operationally efficient.\nInformational Efficiency\nA second measure of efficiency is informational efficiency, or how quickly a source reflects comprehensive\ninformation in the available trading prices. A price is efficient if the market has used all available information\nto set it, which implies that stocks always trade at their fair value (see Figure 11.12). If an investor does not\nreceive the most current information, the prices are “stale”; therefore, they are at a trading disadvantage.\nFigure 11.12 Forms of Market Efficiency A market is efficient if it provides all information that is available.\nForms of Market Efficiency\nFinancial economists have devised three forms of market efficiency from an information perspective: weak\nform, semi-strong form, and strong form. These three forms constitute the efficient market hypothesis.\nBelievers in these three forms of efficient markets maintain, in varying degrees, that it is pointless to search\nfor undervalued stocks, sell stocks at inflated prices, or predict market trends.\nIn weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock’s price history and trading volume. It is useless\nto chart historical stock prices to predict future stock prices such that you can identify mispriced stocks and\nroutinely outperform the market. In other words, technical analysis cannot beat the market. The market itself\nis the best technical analyst out there.\n346\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n11.1 Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\nThis section introduced common stock and some of the models and calculation methods used by investors\nand financial analysts to determine the prices or values of common shares. The most evaluative ratios that can\nbe computed from a company’s financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to book (P/B),\nprice-to-sales (P/S), and price-to cash-flow (P/CF) ratios.\n11.2 Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\nThe dividend discount model, or DDM, is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is\nthe present value of all of its future dividends. The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\n11.4 Preferred Stock",

T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\n354\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-\nexempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid\nsecurities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable. MMMFs provide smaller firms and investors the\nopportunity to participate in the money market by facilitating smaller individual investment amounts.\nFinancial Instrument Typical Maturity Minimum Amount\nIssuer\nTreasury bills\n4–52 weeks\n$10,000\nFederal government\nCommercial paper\n270 days\n$100,000\nBusinesses\nNegotiable CDs\n6 months\n$100,000\nFinancial institutions\nMMMFs\nInvestment companies\nFederal funds\n1 day\n$1 million\nFinancial institutions\nTable 12.1 Money Market Instrument Characteristics (Selected)\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets the equilibrium interest rate\non federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools.

In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and\ninstitutional investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are popular investment vehicles for many types of\ngovernment T-bill, T-note, and T-bond portfolios. An ETF is a basket of securities that can trade like stocks on a\nstock exchange. For example, IEI is an iShares ETF managed by BlackRock that invests in Treasury securities\nwith three to seven years to maturity. When investors buy this ETF, they purchase a small bundle of Treasury\nnotes that they can buy or sell, just as if they owned an individual share of stock.

T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of\n20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8\ntrillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.\nIn 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument, Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once\nper month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the\nsecurity and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts\nmonthly in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of\nthe principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a\ntotal outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury\nborrowing we have discussed.3\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (munis). Local\nborrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,\nmunis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on\nthe perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-\nfree. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\nThere are two primary types of municipal bonds: revenue bonds and general obligation (GO) bonds. GO bonds\ngenerate cash flows to repay the bonds by taxing a project. For instance, a local school district may tax\nresidents to pay for capital construction, or a city may tax citizens to pay for a new public works building.\nRevenue bonds, on the other hand, may apply to projects that generate sufficient cash flows to repay the\nbond—perhaps a utility or local toll road.\nCorporate Bond Markets\nJust as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often\nuses bank loans, commercial paper, or supplier credit for short-term borrowing needs and issues bonds for\nlonger-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline the rules for the\norder, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or more of the required\nactivities lapse.

Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for\ntrading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.\nWhen a corporation uses a real asset, such as property or buildings, to guarantee a bond, the firm has issued a\nmortgage bond. However, it is more common for a corporation to issue an unsecured bond known as a\ndebenture. The risk of a debenture reflects the risk of the entire corporation and does not rely on the value of\na specific underlying asset, as is the case with a mortgage bond.\nThe risk a bondholder bears for buying a bond depends in part on the terms of the bond indenture, market\nconditions over the life of the bond contract, and the ability or inability of the firm to generate sufficient cash\nflows to meet its bond obligations. Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\ncost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade\nbonds. This could limit the number of investors who can participate in the market for lower-grade bonds,\nthereby reducing the liquidity, price, and tradability of those debt securities.\nThere are only two US companies with AAA credit ratings: Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson.5 Over the past 40\nyears, there has been a steady decline of AAA-rated companies (from sixty in 1980). Many institutions have\nfound that this rating requires a more conservative approach to debt that can inhibit growth and revenue. So,\nin today’s market, credit ratings have begun to lose their importance. It seems that the ability to pay debts has\nbecome secondary to the potential for growth.\nFitch Moody’s S&P\nBond Grade/Risk\nAAA\nAaa\nAAA Investment/low risk\nAA\nAa\nAA Investment/low risk\nA\nA\nA\nInvestment/low risk\nTable 12.2 Credit Scale Ratings from the Three Credit\nRating Agencies\n4\nS&P Global Ratings. “Transparency Statement.” S&P Global Ratings. https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/about/transparency\n5\nThe Wall Street Insider. “Why Only Two Companies Are Left with the AAA Rating.” The Wall Street Insider.

For corporations, shares of stock\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the\ncash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.\nCorporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise\ncapital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners. There are generally\ntwo types of stock, preferred and common. Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and bonds.\nPreferred stock has a higher claim to cash flows than common stockholders have (thus the term preferred),\nbut it is lower than that of bondholders. In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of\nthe three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.\nCommon stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a\nclaim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have\nvoting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.\nOne popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or\nmarket cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The largest company by sales\nvolume in 2020 was Walmart.7\nGeographical Location of Exchanges\nOwnership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in an over-\nthe-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly\nadapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a\nbroker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors\nare always able to buy or sell their stocks. An OTC market is an electronic market conducted on computer\nscreens and consists of direct transactions among buyers and sellers, with no broker to bring the two\n6\nSiblis Research. “Total Market Value of US Stock Market.” Siblis Research. https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/;\nThe World Bank. “Market Capitalization of Listed Domestic Companies (current US$).” The World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/\nindicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD\n7\nCompanies Market Cap. “Largest American Companies by Market Capitalization.” Companies Market Cap.\nhttps://companiesmarketcap.com/usa/largest-companies-in-the-usa-by-market-cap/; National Retail Federation. “Top 100 Retailers\n2020 List.” National Retail Federation. 2020. https://nrf.com/resources/top-retailers/top-100-retailers/top-100-retailers-2020-list\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n359\ntogether.

When issuing new equity, the issuing firm receives the proceeds of the sale. Having an active\nsecondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired.\nMost of the trading of equity securities is for used securities on the secondary market.\nAn initial public offering, or IPO, occurs when a firm offers stock to the public for the first time. With a typical\nIPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The\ninvestment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue,\nand establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see\nFigure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of\nthe value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum\ncompany, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.8 The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at\nover $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese\ngovernment.9\nInstitutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Smaller investors\nrarely have the opportunity to purchase. However, any investor can buy the new shares once available for\npublic trading. Investment author and financial expert Professor Burton Malkiel cautions that buying IPOs\nimmediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs\nhave underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.10\nAnother way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through a seasoned equity offering\n(SEO). An IPO occurs when a firm transitions from a private to a public company. An SEO takes place when a\ncorporation that is already publicly traded issues additional shares of stock to the public. An SEO is often part\nof a SEC Rule 415 offering, or so-called shelf registration. Shelf registrations allow a company to register with\nthe SEC to issue new shares but wait up to two years before issuing the shares. This gives companies the\nability to register their intent to issue new shares and to “set them on the shelf” until market conditions are\nmost favorable for issuance to the public.\n8\nJennifer Rudden. “Largest IPOs Worldwide as of January 21, 2021.” Statista. 2021. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269343/\nworlds-largest-ipos/\n9\nDeborah D’Souza. “Ant Group Set to Be World’s Largest IPO Ever.” Investopedia.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and",

In fact, T-bonds often\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,\nbond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments\nin 1982. That year provided the highest annual return in the 20-year period, with an annual return of 32.81%.\nThe lowest annual return was in 1999, as the Federal Reserve began to raise rates to temper an overheating\nstock market caused by dot-com speculation gaining momentum. When the Fed raised interest rates, the\nprices on existing bonds fell, and investors realized a -8.25% return on their bond portfolios. Thus, the range in\nreturns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in\nthis particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust\n10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.\n366\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.8 Treasury Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nInflation slowed from 2000 to 2020, and the average annual rate of return on T-bonds fell accordingly (see\nFigure 12.9). With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being\nlower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the\nprevious century. The range of returns was also smaller than the previous two decades, with the highest\nannual return topping out at 20.10% in 2008 and the lower end dipping down to -11.12% in 2009 as the Fed\nmade a significant effort to reduce interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy following the Great\nRecession.\nCorporate Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs\nThe performance of Baa bonds is very similar to T-Bonds over the four decades spanning 1980 to 2020 (see\nFigure 12.10). These bonds are not default-risk free and require a risk premium for investors. The average\nannual return of 12.07% from 1980 to 1999 topped T-bonds by 1.86%. The margin was greater in the period\nfrom 2000 to 2020 (see Figure 12.11), with Baa bonds (mid-tier corporate bonds) realizing an average annual\npremium of 2.30% over the default-risk free T-bonds.\nThese premiums translate to a substantial increase in investment performance. For example, had an investor\nplaced $100 into a T-bond portfolio in 1980, the value of the investment would have been $1,931 by year-end\n2020. This would have easily outpaced the rate of inflation but significantly lagged the ending value of $4,506\non a similar Baa bond portfolio investment (see Figure 12.12).\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\n367\nFigure 12.9 Treasury Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.10 Baa Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.11 Baa Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\n368\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.12 Baa Bonds versus T-Bonds Performance, 1980–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nProfile of Bill Gross\nBill Gross may be the most successful fixed-income investor ever, but he is also a prime example of the\napplication of the efficient market theory.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If",

The weighted mean is calculated as $117,700 divided by 1,000,\nwhich is $117.70.\nThus, the average cost per share for the 1,000 shares of XYZ Corporation is $117.70.\n13.2\nMeasures of Spread\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate standard deviation for a data set.\n•\nDefine and calculate variance for a data set.\n•\nExplain the relationship between standard deviation and variance.\nStandard Deviation\nAn important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are\nconcentrated close to the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out. For example,\nan investor might examine the yearly returns for Stock A, which are 1%, 2%, -1%, 0%, and 3%, and compare\nthem to the yearly returns for Stock B, which are -9%, 2%, 15%, -5%, and 0%.\nNotice that Stock B exhibits more volatility in yearly returns than Stock A. The investor may want to quantify\nthis variation in order to make the best investment decisions for a particular investment objective.\nThe most common measure of variation, or spread, is standard deviation. The standard deviation of a data\nset is a measure of how far the data values are from their mean. A standard deviation\n•\nprovides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set; and\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n385\n•\ncan be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.\nThe standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set. The standard deviation is\nalways positive or zero. It is small when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little\nvariation or spread. It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\nvariation.\nSuppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The average stock\nprice for both stocks is $5. For Stock A, the standard deviation of the stock price is 2, whereas the standard\ndeviation for Stock B is 4. Because Stock B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more\nvariation in the stock price for Stock B than in the price for Stock A.\nThere are two different formulas for calculating standard deviation. Which formula to use depends on whether\nthe data represents a sample or a population. The notation s is used to represent the sample standard\ndeviation, and the notation\nis used to represent the population standard deviation. In the formulas shown\nbelow, x̄ is the sample mean,\nis the population mean, n is the sample size, and N is the population size.\nFormula for the sample standard deviation:\nFormula for the population standard deviation:\nVariance\nVariance also provides a measure of the spread of data values. The variance of a data set measures the extent\nto which each data value differs from the mean. The more the individual data values differ from the mean, the\nlarger the variance. Both the standard deviation and the variance provide similar information.\nIn a finance application, variance can be used to determine the volatility of an investment and therefore to\nhelp guide financial decisions. For example, a more cautious investor might opt for investments with low\nvolatility.\nSimilar to standard deviation, the formula used to calculate variance also depends on whether the data is\ncollected from a sample or a population. The notation\nis used to represent the sample variance, and the\nnotation σ2 is used to represent the population variance.\nFormula for the sample variance:\nFormula for the population variance:\nThis is the method to calculate standard deviation and variance for a sample:\n1.\nFirst, find the mean\nof the data set by adding the data values and dividing the sum by the number of\ndata values.\n2.\nSet up a table with three columns, and in the first column, list the data values in the data set.\n3.\nFor each row, subtract the mean from the data value\n, and enter the difference in the second\n386\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncolumn. Note that the values in this column may be positive or negative. The sum of the values in this\ncolumn will be zero.\n4.\nIn the third column, for each row, square the value in the second column. So this third column will contain\nthe quantity (Data Value – Mean)2 for each row. We can write this quantity as\n. Note that the\nvalues in this third column will always be positive because they represent a squared quantity.\n5.\nAdd up all the values in the third column. This sum can be written as\n.\n6.\nDivide this sum by the quantity (n – 1), where n is the number of data points. We can write this as\n.\n7.\nThis result is called the sample variance, denoted by s2. Thus, the formula for the sample variance is\n.\n8.\nNow take the square root of the sample variance. This value is the sample standard deviation, called s.\nThus, the formula for the sample standard deviation is\n.\n9.\nRound-off rule: The sample variance and sample standard deviation are typically rounded to one more",

The normal distribution is applicable when the frequency of data values decreases with each\nclass above and below the mean. The normal distribution can be applied to many examples from the finance\nindustry, including average returns for mutual funds over a certain time period, portfolio values, and others.\nThe normal distribution has two parameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,\n, and the\nstandard deviation,\n. The variable x represents the quantity being measured whose data values have a\n394\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnormal distribution.\nFigure 13.3 Graph of the Normal Distribution\nThe curve in Figure 13.3 is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean,\n. The mean is the same\nas the median, which is the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about\n. As the notation\nindicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. Because the area\nunder the curve must equal 1, a change in the standard deviation,\n, causes a change in the shape of the\nnormal curve; the curve becomes fatter and wider or skinnier and taller depending on\n. A change in\ncauses\nthe graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability\ndistributions.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the normal distribution, we find specific areas under the normal\ncurve, and this is further discussed in Apply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts. For example,\nsuppose that at a financial consulting company, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with a standard\ndeviation of $7,500. A normal curve can be drawn to represent this scenario, in which the mean of $60,000\nwould be plotted on the horizontal axis, corresponding to the peak of the curve. Then, to find the probability\nthat an employee earns more than $75,000, you would calculate the area under the normal curve to the right\nof the data value $75,000.\nExcel uses the following command to find the area under the normal curve to the left of a specified value:\n=NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE)\nFor example, at the financial consulting company mentioned above, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with\na standard deviation of $7,500. To find the probability that a random employee’s salary is less than $55,000\nusing Excel, this is the command you would use:\n=NORM.DIST(55000, 60000, 7500, TRUE)\nResult: 0.25249\nThus, there is a probability of about 25% that a random employee has a salary less than $55,000.\nExponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For\nexample, a finance professional might want to model the time to default on payments for company debt\nholders.\nAn exponential distribution is one in which there are fewer large values and more small values. For example,\nmarketing studies have shown that the amount of money customers spend in a store follows an exponential\ndistribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend large\namounts of money.\nExponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or the length of time a\nproduct lasts. The random variable for the exponential distribution is continuous and often measures a\n13.4 • Statistical Distributions\n395\npassage of time, although it can be used in other applications. Typical questions may be, What is the\nprobability that some event will occur between x1 hours and x2 hours? or What is the probability that the event\nwill take more than x1 hours to perform? In these examples, the random variable x equals either the time\nbetween events or the passage of time to complete an action (e.g., wait on a customer). The probability\ndensity function is given by\nwhere\nis the historical average of the values of the random variable (e.g., the historical average waiting\ntime). This probability density function has a mean and standard deviation of\n.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the exponential distribution, we find specific areas under the",

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval. The second case, where we\nare asking for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variable y of a single experiment using a value of x,\nis called the prediction interval.\nThe prediction interval for an individual y for\ncan be calculated as\nwhere se is the standard deviation of the error term, sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable, and\nis\nthe critical value of the t-distribution at the\nconfidence level.\nTabulated values of the t-distribution are available in online references such as the Engineering Statistics\nHandbook (https://openstax.org/r/engineering_handbook). The mathematical computations for prediction\nintervals are complex, and usually the calculations are performed using software. The formula above can be\nimplemented in Excel to create a 95% prediction interval for the forecast for monthly revenue when\nis spent on monthly advertising. Figure 14.10 shows the detailed calculations in Excel to arrive at a\n95% prediction interval of (13,270.95, 15,370.09) for the monthly revenue.

For\nexample, the statistical program R provides these prediction intervals directly. It is important to know just\nwhich interval is being tested in the computer package because the difference in the size of the standard\ndeviations will change the size of the interval estimated. This is shown in Figure 14.11.\nFigure 14.11 Prediction and Confidence Intervals for Regression Equation at 95% Confidence Level\nFigure 14.11 shows visually the difference the standard deviation makes in the size of the estimated intervals.\nThe confidence interval, measuring the expected value of the dependent variable, is smaller than the\nprediction interval for the same level of confidence. The expected value method assumes that the experiment\nis conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method. The logic here is similar, although\nnot identical, to that discussed when developing the relationship between the sample size and the confidence\ninterval using the central limit theorem. There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation.

Finance)\nAs investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has\ngood years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just\nlike DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the\nsame for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return\nfor XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive\nreturn. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,\nwashing away some of the volatility.\nWhen an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.\nWhen two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the\nvolatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How\ncorrelated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.\nYou will recall from our study of correlation in Regression Analysis in Finance that a correlation coefficient\ndescribes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a\nperfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two\nvariables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more\n15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\n459\nstrongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated\nin a portfolio decreases risk.\nNotice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard\ndeviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less\nthan one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed\nto many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two\nstocks provides only a small decrease in risk.\nThis is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy\nis strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.\nWhen something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both\ncompanies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is\nspecific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure\nto the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience\npositive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.\nOn the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation\nthan those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM\nis likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the\nstandard deviation of the portfolio more.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHow to Build a Diversified Portfolio\nTV personality, former hedge fund manager, and author Jim Cramer encourages investors to build a\ndiversified portfolio, having no more than 20% of a portfolio in one sector.3 Watch this CNBC video\n(https://openstax.org/r/CNBC_video) to learn more about how he suggests investors can build a diversified\nportfolio by purchasing five to 10 stocks.\nPortfolio Size and Risk\nAs you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases. The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important.

It is used as\nan investing benchmark. The average rate of return for the three-month US Treasury security from 1928 to\n2020 is 3.36%.5 You can see that you will not become immensely wealthy by investing in US Treasury bills.\nAnother characteristic of US Treasury securities, however, is that their volatility tends to be much lower than\nthat of stocks. In fact, the standard deviation of returns for the US Treasury bills is 3.0%. Unlike the returns for\nstocks, the return on US Treasury bills has never been negative. The lowest annual return was 0.03%, which\noccurred in 2014.6\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUS Treasury Securities\nVisit the website of the US Department of the Treasury (https://openstax.org/r/home.treasury) to learn\nmore about US Treasury securities. You will find current interest rates for both short-term securities (US\nTreasury bills) and long-term securities (US Treasury bonds).\nRisk Premium\nYou know that if you use your $20,000 to invest in stock rather than in US Treasury bills, the outcome of the\ninvestment will be uncertain. Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will\nonly be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to\ntake the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make\ninvesting in US Treasury securities.\nFrom 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher\nthan the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.7 Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,\nhowever, have also been much more volatile. In fact, there were 25 years in which the return for the S&P 500\nindex was negative.\nYou may not be willing to take the risk of losing some of the money your grandparents gave you because you\nhave been setting it aside for law school. If that’s the case, you will want to invest in US Treasury securities.\nYou may have money that you are saving for other long-term goals, such as retirement, with which you are\nwilling to take some risk. The extra return that you will earn for taking on risk is known as the risk premium.\nThe risk premium can be thought of as your reward for being willing to bear risk.\nThe risk premium is calculated as the difference between the return you receive for taking on risk and what\nyou would have returned if you did not take on risk.

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3. Monthly returns for DAL and for the S&P 500\nare plotted in the diagram. Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to a month from 2018 to 2020; for\nexample, the dot that lies furthest in the upper right-hand corner represents November 2020. The return for\nthe S&P 500 was 10.88% that month; this return is plotted along the horizontal axis. The return for DAL during\nNovember 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.\nYou can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return\nfor DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL\nis also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta. Beta\nmeasures the amount of systematic risk that DAL has.\nFigure 15.3 Calculation of Beta for DAL (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\n15.3 • The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n463\nCAPM Equation\nBecause DAL’s beta of 1.39 is greater than 1, DAL is riskier than the average stock in the market. Finance\ntheory suggests that investors who purchase DAL will expect a higher rate of return to compensate them for\nthis risk. DAL has 139% of the average stock’s systematic risk; therefore, investors in the stock should receive\n139% of the market risk premium.\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) equation is\nwhere Re is the expected return of the asset, Rf is the risk-free rate of return, and Rm is the expected return of\nthe market.

Two internet sources\nthat can be used to find a company’s beta are Yahoo! Finance (https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo) and\nMarketWatch (https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact\nsame value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021, Yahoo! Finance reported that the\nbeta for DAL was 1.46,8 while MarketWatch reported it as 1.29.9 Both of these numbers are slightly\ndifferent from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.\nThere are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in\nthe beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta in Figure 15.3. Time frames\nranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different\nsources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are\nused in Figure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data.

Suppose that you see an advertisement in which McKinley\nInvestment Management claims that the portfolios of its clients have an average return of 20% per year. You\nknow that this average annual return is meaningless without also knowing something about the riskiness of\nthe firm’s strategy. In this section, we consider some ways to evaluate the riskiness of an investment strategy.\nA basic measure of investment performance that includes an adjustment for risk is the Sharpe ratio. The\nSharpe ratio is computed as a portfolio’s risk premium divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s\nreturn, using the formula\nThe portfolio risk premium is the portfolio return RP minus the risk-free return Rf; this is the basic reward for\nbearing risk. If the risk-free return is 3%, McKinley Investment Management’s clients who are earning 20% on\ntheir portfolios have an excess return of 17%.\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio’s return,\n, is a measure of risk. Although you see that McKinley’s\nclients earn a nice 20% return on average, you find that the returns are highly volatile. In some years, the\nclients earn much more than 20%, and in other years, the return is much lower, even negative. That volatility\nleads to a standard deviation of returns of 26%. The Sharpe ratio would be\n, or 0.65.\nThus, the Sharpe ratio can be thought of as a reward-to-risk ratio. The standard deviation in the denominator\ncan be thought of as the units of risk the investor has. The numerator is the reward the investor is receiving for\ntaking on that risk.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe. You can visit Sharpe’s Stanford\nUniversity website (https://openstax.org/r/stanford_wfsharpe) to find videos in which he discusses financial\ntopics and links to his research as well as his advice on how to invest.\nTreynor Measurement of Performance\nAnother reward-to-risk ratio measurement of investment performance is the Treynor ratio. The Treynor ratio\nis calculated as\nJust as with the Sharpe ratio, the numerator of the Treynor ratio is a portfolio’s risk premium; the difference is\nthat the Treynor ratio focus focuses on systematic risk, using the beta of the portfolio in the denominator,\nwhile the Shape ratio focuses on total risk, using the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns in the\n15.4 • Applications in Performance Measurement\n465\ndenominator.\nIf McKinley Investment Management has a portfolio with a 20% return over the past five years, with a beta of\n1.2 and a risk-free rate of 3%, the Treynor ratio would be\nBoth the Sharpe and Treynor ratios are relative measures of investment performance, meaning that there is\nnot an absolute number that indicates whether an investment performance is good or bad. An investment\nmanager’s performance must be considered in relation to that of other managers or to a benchmark index.\nJensen’s Alpha\nJensen’s alpha is another common measure of investment performance. It is computed as the raw portfolio\nreturn minus the expected portfolio return predicted by the CAPM:\nSuppose that the average market return has been 12%. What would Jensen’s alpha be for McKinley Investment\nManagement’s portfolio with a 20% average return and a beta of 1.2?\nUnlike the Sharpe and Treynor ratios, which are meaningful in a relative sense, Jensen’s alpha is meaningful in\nan absolute sense. An alpha of 0.062 indicates that the McKinley Investment Management portfolio provided a\nreturn that was 6.2% higher than would be expected given the riskiness of the portfolio. A positive alpha\nindicates that the portfolio had an abnormal return. If Jensen’s alpha equals zero, the portfolio return was\nexactly what was expected given the riskiness of the portfolio as measured by beta.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nComparing the Returns and Risks of Portfolios\nYou are interviewing two investment managers. Mr. Wong shows that the average return on his portfolio\nfor the past 10 years has been 14%, with a standard deviation of 8% and a beta of 1.2. Ms. Petrov shows that",

The average monthly portfolio return is 2.69%.\nBecause this is an equally weighted portfolio, with each of the four stocks impacting the portfolio return in the\nsame way, the average monthly portfolio return of 2.69% is the same as the sum of the average monthly\nreturns of the four stocks divided by four, or\n.\nThe standard deviation of the monthly portfolio returns is calculated in cell F40.

In fact, the standard deviation for the portfolio is less\nthan the standard deviation for any one of the four stocks. Remember that this occurs because the stock\nreturns are not perfectly positively correlated. The high return of one of the stocks in one month is dampened\nby a lower return in another stock during the same month. Likewise, a negative return in one stock during a\nmonth might be offset by a positive return in one of the other three stocks during the same month. This is the\nrisk reduction benefit of holding a portfolio of stocks.\nCalculating Beta\nThe standard deviation of a stock’s returns indicates the stock’s volatility. Remember that the volatility is\ncaused by both firm-specific and systematic risk. Investors will not be rewarded for firm-specific risk because\n15.5 • Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\n469\nthey can diversify away from it. Investors are, however, rewarded for systematic risk. To determine how much\nof a firm’s risk is due to systematic risk, you can use Excel to calculate the stock’s beta.\nTo calculate a stock’s beta, you need the monthly return for the market in addition to the monthly market\nreturn for the stock. In column B in Figure 15.6, the monthly return for SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust, is\nrecorded. SPY is an ETF that was created to mimic the performance of the S&P 500 index by State Street Global\nAdvisors and is often used as a proxy for the overall market performance. The monthly returns for AMZN are\nvisible in column C. It is important that these returns be lined up so that the returns for a particular month for\nboth securities appear in the same row number. Also, you want to place the returns for SPY in the column to\nthe left of the returns for AMZN so that when you create your graph, SPY will automatically appear on the\nhorizontal axis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nState Street Global Advisors\nYou can learn more about State Street Global Advisors and its creation of the first ETF by visiting the\ncompany’s history page at its website (ssga.com) (https://openstax.org/r/ssga_institutional_our-history).\nYou will use a scatter plot to create a graph. In Excel, go to the Insert tab, and then from the Chart menu,\nchoose the first scatter plot option.\nFigure 15.6 Excel Format for Calculating Beta (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\nSelecting the scatter plot option will result in a chart being inserted that looks like the chart in Figure 15.7. Each\ndot represents one month’s combination of returns, with the return for SPY measured on the horizontal axis\nand the return for AMZN measured on the vertical axis. Consider, for example, the dot in the furthest upper\nright-hand section of the figure. This dot is the plot of returns for the month of April 2020, when the return for\nSPY was 13.36% (measured on the horizontal axis) and the return for AMZN was 26.89% (measured on the\n470\n15 • How to Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nvertical axis).\nHover your mouse over one of the dots, and right-click the dot to pull up a chart formatting menu.

            "chunk": "rule of not adding or comparing cash flows that occur in different time periods.\nA second disadvantage of using the payback period method is that there is not a clearly defined acceptance or\nrejection criterion. When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length of time in which a\nproject must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods\nthan the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s were to set a payback period of four\nyears, Project A would be accepted, but Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and so would\nbe rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years would be arbitrary; it is not grounded in any\nfinancial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of three, four, five, or\nany other number of years as its criterion for accepting projects.\nA third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all\nhave payback periods of five years. However, Projects B and C end after year 5, while Project D has a large cash\nflow that occurs in year 6, which is excluded from the analysis. The payback method is shortsighted in that it\nfavors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash\nflows after the arbitrary payback time criterion.\nFourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful the planning and analysis,\na business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier than others, with less\ncertain cash flows, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash\nflows.\n16.1 • Payback Period Method\n481\n16.2\nNet Present Value (NPV) Method\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine net present value.\n•\nCalculate net present value.\n•\nList the advantages and disadvantages of using the net present value method.\n•\nGraph an NPV profile.\nNet Present Value (NPV) Calculation\nSam’s purchasing of the embroidery machine involves spending money today in the hopes of making more\nmoney in the future. Because the cash inflows and outflows occur in different time periods, they cannot be\ndirectly compared to each other. Instead, they must be translated into a common time period using time value\nof money techniques. By converting all of the cash flows that will occur from a project into present value, or\ncurrent dollars, the cash inflows from the project can be compared to the cash outflows. If the cash inflows\nexceed the cash outflows in present value terms, the project will add value and should be accepted. The\ndifference between the present value of the cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows is known as\nnet present value (NPV).\nThe equation for NPV can be written as\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision of whether to purchase the embroidery machine. If we assume that\nafter six years the embroidery machine will be obsolete and the project will end, when placed on a timeline,\nthe project’s expected cash flow is shown in Table 16.3:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCash Flow ($) (16,000) 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000\nTable 16.3\nCalculating NPV is simply a time value of money problem in which each cash flow is discounted back to the\npresent value. If we assume that the cost of funds for Sam’s is 9%, then the NPV can be calculated as\nBecause the NPV is positive, Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the embroidery machine. The value of the\nfirm will increase by $2,835.63 as a result of accepting the project.\nCalculating NPV involves computing the present value of each cash flow and then summing the present values\nof all cash flows from the project. This project has six future cash flows, so six present values must be\ncomputed. Although this is not difficult, it is tedious.\nA financial calculator is able to calculate a series of present values in the background for you, automating\nmuch of the process. You simply have to provide the calculator with each cash flow, the time period in which\neach cash flow occurs, and the discount rate that you want to use to discount the future cash flows to the\npresent.\nFollow the steps in Table 16.4 for calculating NPV:\n482\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nSelect cash flow worksheet\nCF\nCF\nCF0\nXXXX\n2\nClear the cash flow worksheet\n2ND\n2ND [CLR WORK] CF0\n0\n3\nEnter initial cash flow\n16000 +/-\n+/- ENTER\nENTER CF0 = -16,000.00\n4\nEnter cash flow for the first year\n↓\n2000 ENTER\nENTER\nC01 =\n2,000.00\n↓\nF01 =\n1.0\n5\nEnter cash flow for the second year ↓\n4000 ENTER\nENTER\nC02 =\n4,000.00\n↓\nF02 =\n1.0\n6\nEnter cash flow for the third year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC03 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF03 =\n1.0\n7\nEnter cash flow for the fourth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC04 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF04 =\n1.0\n8\nEnter cash flow for the fifth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC05 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF05 =\n1.0\n9\nEnter cash flow for the sixth year\n↓\n5000 ENTER\nENTER\nC06 =\n5,000.00\n↓\nF06 =\n1.0\n10\nSelect NPV\nNPV\nNPV\nI\n0.00\n11",

First, the NPV\nmethod uses the time value of money concept. All of the cash flows are discounted back to their present value\nto be compared. Second, the NPV method provides a clear decision criterion. Projects with a positive NPV\nshould be accepted, and projects with a negative NPV should be rejected. Third, the discount rate used to\ndiscount future cash flows to the present can be increased or decreased to adjust for the riskiness of the\nproject’s cash flows.\nDisadvantages\nThe NPV method can be difficult for someone without a finance background to understand.

Your cost of capital is 10%. The positive\nNPV of $49,474 for the project makes this an acceptable project.\nAnother ice-cream truck is also for sale for $50,000. This truck is smaller and will not be able to hold as many\nfrozen treats. However, the truck is newer, with lower mileage, and you estimate that you can use it for six\nyears. This newer truck will allow you to generate a cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The\nNPV of the newer truck is $80,658.\nBecause both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which\ntruck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its\nhigher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made\nsimply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV\nthan the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.\nThere are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life\nproject concludes, another, similar project will be available.\nReplacement Chain Approach\nWith the replacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal\nthe life of the long-life project. You can purchase the newer, lower-mileage ice-cream truck and run your\nbusiness for six years. To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last\nfor three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for\nthe next three years. In essence, you are comparing a six-year project with two consecutive three-year projects\nso that both options will generate cash inflows for six years. Your timeline for the projects (comparing an\nolder, larger truck with a newer, lower-mileage truck) will look like Table 16.12:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOlder Truck ($)\n($50,000) 40,000 40,000\n40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000\nOlder Truck ($)\n(50,000)\nNewer Truck ($)\n(50,000) 30,000 30,000\n30,000 30,000 30,000 30,000\nTable 16.12\nThe present values of all of the cash inflows and outflows from purchasing two of the older, larger trucks\nconsecutively are added together to find the NPV of that alternative.

This approach involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\n•\nThe NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\n•\nThe NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\nproject.\n•\nFor the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.\n•\nFor the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\nformula.\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that\nprojects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions\nare likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the\nfuture, these changes are potentially greater.\nChoosing Projects When Resources Are Limited\nChoosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will\nchoose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount\nof capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several\npositive NPV projects.

However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be\nused. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return\nhas been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from\nwhat it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk\npremiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n513\nThe same issue with how much historical data should be considered arises when calculating a company’s beta.\nDifferent financial managers can calculate significantly different betas even for well-established, stable\ncompanies. In April 2021, for example, the beta for IBM was reported as 0.97 by MarketWatch and as 1.25 by\nYahoo! Finance.\nThe CAPM estimate of the cost of equity capital for IBM is significantly different depending on what source is\nused for the company’s beta and what value is used for the market risk premium. Using a market risk\npremium of 5%, the beta of 0.97 provided by MarketWatch, and a risk-free rate of 3% results in a cost of capital\nof\nIf, instead, a market risk premium of 8% and the beta of 1.25 provided by Yahoo! Finance are used, the cost of\ncapital is estimated to be\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating the Equity Cost of Capital\nAlthough the calculation of the cost of capital using the CAPM equation is simple and straightforward, there\nis not one definitive equity cost of capital for a company that all financial managers will agree on. Consider\nthe eight companies spotlighted in Table 17.3.\nFour estimates of the equity cost of capital are calculated for each firm. The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%. If you assume instead that the\naverage long-run return on the S&P 500 is 11%, then people who purchase a portfolio of those stocks are\nrewarded by earning 8 percentage points more than the 3% they would earn investing in the risk-free\nsecurity.\nThe last two estimates of the cost of equity capital for each company also use the same risk-free rate of 3%\nand the possible market risk premiums of 5% and 8%.

Finance; MarketWatch)\n514\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example,\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an\nestimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much\nhigher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and\nRubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with\nan estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable\nassumptions.\nWhat is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A\nfinancial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different\nchoices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.",

Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases. Once the company’s debt\nexceeds its guaranteed cash flow, which is $18,000 in our example, debt holders face some risk that the\ncompany will not be able to pay them. At that point, the cost of debt rises above the risk-free rate. As the\n518\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nweight of debt approaches 100%, the cost of debt capital approaches the cost of equity of the unlevered firm.\nIn other words, if you financed the T-shirt business solely through the use of debt, the debt holders would\nrequire a 14% return because they would be bearing the entire risk of the business and would demand to be\nrewarded for doing so.\nAs the leverage of the firm increases, both the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity capital increase.\nHowever, as the firm’s leverage increases, it is using proportionately more of the relatively cheaper source of\ncapital—debt— and proportionately less of the relatively more expensive source of capital—equity. Thus, the\nWACC remains constant as leverage increases, despite the rising cost of each component.\nAmount of Debt Amount of Equity Weight of Debt Weight of Equity Cost of Debt Cost of Equity WACC\n$ -\n$45,614\n0%\n100%\n0.0400\n0.1400\n14%\n$5,000\n$40,614\n11%\n89%\n0.0400\n0.1523\n14%\n$10,000\n$35,614\n22%\n78%\n0.0400\n0.1681\n14%\n$15,000\n$30,614\n33%\n67%\n0.0400\n0.1890\n14%\n$17,000\n$28,614\n37%\n63%\n0.0400\n0.1994\n14%\n$20,000\n$25,614\n44%\n56%\n0.0600\n0.2025\n14%\n$30,000\n$15,614\n66%\n34%\n0.0800\n0.2553\n14%\n$40,000\n$5,614\n88%\n12%\n0.1000\n0.4250\n14%\nTable 17.4 Alternative Capital Structures for Your T-Shirt Business\nThe Impact of Taxes\nIn perfect capital markets, the choice of capital structure will not impact the value of the firm or the cost of the\nfirm’s financing. In the real world, however, capital markets are not perfect. One of the important market\nimperfections is the presence of corporate taxes. Because the choice of capital structure can impact the taxes\nthat a company pays, in the real world, capital structure can impact the cost of capital and the firm’s value.\nAssume that your T-shirt business venture will result in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $52,000\nnext year and that the corporate tax rate is 28%.

Where does the extra $78.40 to pay investors come from? It comes from the\nreduction in taxes that the firm pays due to leverage. If the company uses no debt, it pays $14,560 in taxes. The\nlevered firm pays only $14,481.60 in taxes, a savings of $78.40.\nThe $280 that the levered company pays in interest is shielded from the corporate tax, resulting in tax savings\nof\n. The additional amount available to investors because of the tax deductibility of\ninterest payments is known as the interest tax shield. The interest tax shield is calculated as\nWhen interest is a tax-deductible expense, the total value of the levered firm will exceed the value of the\nunlevered firm by the amount of this interest tax shield. The tax-advantage status of debt financing impacts\nthe WACC. The WACC with taxes is calculated as\nThis formula can be written as\nThus, the WACC with taxes is lower than the pretax WACC because of the interest tax shield.

The presence of the interest tax shield\nencourages firms to use debt financing in their capital structures.\n17.5\nOptimal Capital Structure\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how increased use of leverage increases the possibility of financial distress.\n•\nExplain how the possibility of financial distress impacts the cost of capital.\n•\nDiscuss the trade-offs a firm faces as it increases its leverage.\n•\nExplain the concept of an optimal capital structure.\nDebt and Financial Distress\nThe more debt a company uses in its capital structure, the larger the dollar value of the interest tax shield.\nWhy, then, do we not see firms using a capital structure composed 100% of debt to maximize this interest tax\nshield?\nThe answer to this question lies in the fact that as a company increases its debt, there is a greater chance that\nthe firm will be unable to make its required interest payments on the debt. If the firm has difficulty meeting its\n520\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndebt obligations, it is said to be in financial distress.\nA firm in financial distress incurs both direct and indirect costs. The direct costs of financial distress include\nfees paid to lawyers, consultants, appraisers, and auctioneers. The indirect costs include loss of customers and\nsuppliers.\nTrade-Off Theory\nTrade-off theory weighs the advantages and disadvantages of using debt in the capital structure. The\nadvantage of using debt is the interest tax shield. The disadvantage of using debt is that it increases the risk of\nfinancial distress and the costs associated with financial distress.\nA company has an incentive to increase leverage to exploit the interest tax shield. However, too much debt will\nmake it more likely that the company will default and incur financial distress costs. Calculating the precise\nbalance between these two is difficult if not impossible.\nFor companies with a low level of debt, the risk of default is low, and the main impact of an increase in\nleverage will be an increase in the interest tax shield. At some point, however, the tax savings that result from\nincreasing the amount of debt in the capital structure will be just offset by the increased probability of\nincurring the costs of financial distress. For firms that have higher costs of financing distress, this point will be\nreached sooner. Thus, firms that face higher costs of financial distress have a lower optimal level of leverage\nthan firms that face lower costs of financial distress.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNetflix\nNetflix has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 25 years.

As we saw earlier in the chapter, we begin with forecasted sales because they are\nthe basis for many of the forecasted costs.\nLet’s begin with the sales forecast for Clear Lake Sporting Goods that we saw earlier in the chapter, in Figure\n18.9, and use it along with the prior year income statement by month shown in Figure 18.12. We will consider\nother data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.12 Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month\nThe first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income.

The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales. Thus, Clear Lake estimates its\nunearned revenue balance each month by taking the current month’s net sales from the forecasted income\nstatement and multiplying it by 50%.\nShort-term investments, notes payable, and common stock are not anticipated to change, so the current\nbalance is forecasted to remain the same for the next 12 months.\n548\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo forecast the ending balance for retained earnings for each month, managers add the monthly net income\nfrom the forecasted balance sheet to the prior balance and subtract a quarterly $10,000 dividend.\nOnce all of these accounts are completed, the balance sheet is out of balance. Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable. Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),\nand the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other\nexpenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.\nWe learned in Financial Statements that net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.",

In personal finance, financial resiliency is the ability to overcome financial difficulties such as sudden\njob loss or significant unexpected expenses—to spring back quickly.\nTo help promote resiliency, personal financial planners advise clients to maintain liquid assets equal to three\nto six months of living expenses, keep debt levels low, manage the household budget, keep insurance in force\n(health, property, and life), establish a solid credit history, and make wise use of credit cards and home equity\nlines of credit.\nIn business finance, financial resiliency is not important only during pandemics but is important through the\nups and downs of seasonal cycles and economic downturns. Managing cash, accounts receivable, and\ninventory while making optimal use of trade credit (accounts payable) makes for a business that meets its\noperating needs and pays its debts when due.\nWorking capital management is also critical during good times.

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.\nNet working capital possibilities can be thought of as a spectrum from negative working capital to positive, as\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n567\nexplained in Table 19.1.\nNegative Net Working Capital\nZero Net Working Capital\nPositive Net Working Capital\nCurrent liabilities are greater than\ncurrent assets.\nCurrent assets equal current\nliabilities.\nCurrent assets are greater than\ncurrent liabilities.\nCould indicate a liquidity problem.\nThere is difficulty satisfying current\nobligations.\nIndicates that current assets could\ncover current obligations. However,\nthere is no positive margin (safety\ncushion) or “liquid reserve” to\nsatisfy unexpected cash needs.\nIndicates that the company can\nmeet its current obligations.\nHowever, excessively high net\nworking capital could mean too\nlittle cash and therefore an\nopportunity cost (forgoing rates of\nreturn on alternative investment).\nTable 19.1 Spectrum of Net Working Capital\nMeasures of Financial Health provides information on a variety of financial ratios to help users of financial\nstatements understand the strengths and weakness of companies’ financial statements. Three of the financial\nratios covered in that chapter are brought back into this chapter’s discussion to demonstrate how financial\nmanagers examine working capital and liquidity. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted\ninto cash. Those ratios are the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio. A higher ratio indicates a\ngreater level of liquidity.\nThe formulas for the three liquidity ratios are:\nNotice how the current ratio includes the two elements of net working capital—current assets and current\nliabilities. It makes for a quick comparison of relative size or proportion.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCurrent Ratio\nA company has $2,000,000 of current assets, while its current liabilities are $1,000,000. What is the current\nratio, and what does it mean?\nSolution:\nThe current ratio would be\nwhich is a 2:1 proportion of current asset value to\nthe amount of the current liabilities. This means that if all the current assets could be converted to cash,\nthen the current liabilities could be satisfied two times.\nThere are two drawbacks to the current ratio: (1) it is a working capital analytic as of a point in time but is not\nindicative of future liquidity or future cash flows and (2) as an indicator of liquidity, it can be deceptive if a\nsignificant proportion of the current assets are inventory, supplies, or prepaid expenses. Inventory is not very\nliquid as it can take an extended time period to convert to cash, and assets such as supplies and prepaid",

Other credit\nmanagement techniques, some of which are explained in subsequent sections, can help minimize and control\nthe receivables collection period.\nThe payables deferral period is the one element that probably cannot be optimized without violating credit\nterms. Certainly, cash balances can be conserved by delaying payments to vendors for as long as possible;\nhowever, payments on trade credit need to be made on time or the company’s relationship with the supplier\ncan suffer. In a worst-case scenario, the company’s credit rating could also deteriorate.\nA credit rating, also called a credit score, is a measure produced by an independent agency indicating the\n572\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nlikelihood that a company will meet its financial obligations as they come due; it is an indication of the\ncompany’s ability to pay its creditors. Three business credit rating services are Equifax Small Business,\nExperian Business, and Dun & Bradstreet.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle\nConsidering the previous Think It Through (Scenario 1), what if you could reduce inventory levels, hold\nlower accounts receivable balances, and rely more heavily on accounts payable while maintaining the same\nsales level?\nHere’s Scenario 2. Because of better inventory management, credit and collections management, and\nnegotiation of longer payment periods with vendors, King Sized Products (KSP) Inc. needs less investment\nin inventory and accounts receivable and is able to utilize a greater amount of trade credit financing.\nAnnual credit sales are $40,000,000, average inventory is $2,800,000, average accounts receivable are\n$5,500,000, average accounts payable are $3,300,000, and cost of goods sold is $30,000,000. What is the\ncash conversion cycle?\nSolution:\nInventory conversion period:\n•\n•\n•\nReceivables collection period:\n•\n•\nPayables deferral period:\n•\n•\nNotice that the investment in inventory and accounts receivable is less and the average accounts payable is\nmore with no change in credit sales and cost of goods sold—you would certainly anticipate a reduction in\nthe cash conversion cycle. The improvement would be about 13 days (from 57.2 in Scenario 1 to 44.1 days in\nScenario 2). Figure 19.4 shows a bar chart comparison of the two scenarios.\nScenario 1 Scenario 2\nInventory Conversion Period\n36.50\n34.07\nReceivables Collection Period\n54.75\n50.21\nPayables Deferral Period\n34.07\n40.15\nCash Conversion Cycle\n57.18\n44.10\nTable 19.2\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n573\nFigure 19.4 Scenario 1 and 2 Comparison: Shortening the Cash Conversion Cycle\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA Harvard Business School blog post, How Amazon Survived the Dot-Com Bubble (https://openstax.org/r/\nhow-amazon-survived), discusses how Amazon managed its cash conversion cycle to the point where it was\nreceiving payment for the things it sold before Amazon had to pay for them. In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a long operating cycle because of the\nproduction process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current\nratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much\nlower current ratios.\nIn recent years, Walmart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has had a current ratio of around 0.9 and has been able to\nmanage its working capital needs by efficient management of its supply chain, quick turnover of inventory,\nand a very small investment in accounts receivables.1 Big retailers like Walmart are effective at negotiating\nfavorable payment terms with their vendors. The ability to generate consistent positive cash flow from\noperations allows a retailer like Walmart to operate with relatively low amounts of working capital.\nThe credit policies of a company also affect working capital. A company with a liberal credit policy will require a\ngreater amount of working capital, as collection periods of accounts receivable are longer and therefore tie up\n1",

Accounts payable is a type of obligation that is interest-free and is distinguished\nfrom debt obligations, such as notes payable, that require the creditor to pay back principal and interest.\n2\nUS Small Business Administration. “PPP Loan Forgiveness.” n.d. https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-\noptions/paycheck-protection-program/ppp-loan-forgiveness\n19.2 • What Is Trade Credit?\n575\nHow Trade Credit Works\nTrade credit is common in B2B (business to business) transactions and is analogous to consumer spending\nusing a credit card. With a credit card, a consumer opens an account with a credit limit. Most trade credit is\noffered to a company with an open account that has a credit limit up to which the company can purchase\ngoods or services without having to pay the cash up front. As long as the payments are made in accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement (also called credit terms), no interest or additional fees are charged on the\ncredit balance except possibly for a fee for late payment.\nInitially, the vendor’s credit department approves both a trade credit limit and credit payment terms (i.e.,\nnumber of days after the invoice date that payment is due). Timely payments on accounts payable (trade\ncredit) helps create a credit history for the purchasing firm.\nTrade Credit Terms\nTrade credit arrangements often carry credit terms that offer an incentive, called a discount, for a company\n(the buyer) to pay its bill within a relatively short period of time. Net terms, also referred to as the full credit\nperiod, are the number of days that a business (purchaser) has before they must pay their invoice. A common\nnet term is Net 30, with payment due in full within 30 days of the invoice.\nMany vendors also offer cash discounts to customers that pay their bill early. A company’s invoice that\nspecifies payment terms of “2/10 n/30” (stated as: “two ten net 30”) would allow a 2 percent discount if the\nbuyer’s account balance is paid within 10 days of the invoice date; otherwise, the net amount owed would be\ndue in 30 days. The “10 days” in the example is the discount period—the number of days the buyer has to\ntake advantage of the cash discount for an early payment, also known as quick payment.\nFor example, Jackson’s Premium Jams Inc. received a $10,500 invoice for the purchase of jelly jars. The invoice\nhas payment terms of 2/10 n/30. Jackson’s pays the bill within 10 days of the invoice date. Jackson’s payment\nwould be\n. The effect of taking a discount because of a quick payment\nis a lowering of the cost of inventory in the case of purchases of materials (for a manufacturer), merchandise\n(for a retailer or wholesaler), and operating expenses (for any company that “buys” services using trade\ncredit). In Cost of Trade Credit, there is an example that shows the high annualize opportunity cost (36.73\npercent) of not taking advantage of cash discounts.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nTrade Credit of International Trade\nWhen international trade occurs, two important documents are commonly required: a letter of credit and\na bill of lading. A letter of credit is issued by a financial institution on behalf of the foreign buyer\n(importer). The bill of lading is a legal document that gives proof of a contract between a transportation\ncompany and the buyer and is one important piece of documentation that allows the buyer to draw on the\nletter of credit. A bill of lading serves as a document of title and proof of receipt of goods by the shipper.\nThe letter of credit secures a promise of payment to the seller (exporter) provided that the terms of the sale\nare met. For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a\nliability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.\nCost of Trade Credit\nTrade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,\nbank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade\ncredit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts\npayable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long\n576\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nas payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.\nHowever, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of\ncash discounts when offered by sellers. Using accounts payable to purchase goods and services can involve an\nopportunity cost—a cost of the forgone opportunity of making a quick payment and benefiting from a cash\ndiscount. A business that does not take advantage of a cash discount for early payment of trade credit will pay",

Credit card sales are not technically accounts\nreceivable. When a credit card is accepted, it means that the credit card company (e.g., VISA, MasterCard, or\nAmerican Express) will guarantee the payment. The cash will be deposited in the merchant’s bank account in a\nvery short period of time.\nWhen a business makes a sale on account, management (e.g., a credit manager or analyst) does its best to\ndistinguish between customers who have a high likelihood of paying and customers who have a low likelihood.\nCustomers with low credit risk are approved; the decision is based on an effective analysis of creditworthiness.\nCreditworthiness is judged by looking at a number of factors including an evaluation of the customer’s\nfinancial statements, financial ratios, and credit reports (credit scores) based on a customer’s payment history\non credits owed to other firms. If a company has a prior relationship with a customer seeking trade credit, the\ncustomer’s payment history with the firm is also carefully evaluated before additional credit is granted.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCorporate Finance Institute\nCredit managers use various tools and techniques to evaluate creditworthiness of customers. The\nCorporate Finance Institute’s website states that “the ‘5 Cs of Credit’ is a common phrase used to describe\nthe five major factors [character, capacity, collateral, capital, and conditions] used to determine a potential\nborrower’s creditworthiness.” It goes on to say that “a credit report provides a comprehensive account of\nthe borrower’s total debt, current balances, credit limits, and history of defaults and bankruptcies, if any.”5\nMore on the 5 Cs of credit can be found on the Corporate Finance Institute’s website (https://openstax.org/\nr/corporate-finance).\nDetermining the Credit Policy\nA company’s credit policy encompasses rules of credit granting and procedures for the collections of accounts.\nIt’s how a company will process credit applications, utilize credit scoring and credit bureaus, analyze financial\nstatements, make credit limit decisions, and conduct collection efforts when accounts become delinquent (still\noutstanding after their due date).\nEstablishing Credit Terms\nTrade credit terms were discussed earlier. Recall that part of the terms and conditions of a sale are the credit\nterms—elements of a sales agreement (contract) that indicate when payment is due, possible discounts (for\nquick payments), and any late fee charges.\nIf open credit is for a sales transaction, an agreement is made as to the length of time for which credit is to be\ngranted (payment period) and a discount for early payment. Although companies are free to establish credit\nterms as they see fit, most companies look to the practice of the particular industry in which they operate. The\ncredit terms offered by the competition are a factor. Net terms usually range between 30 days and 90 days,\ndepending on the industry. Discounts for early payments also differ and are typically from 1 to 3 percent.\nEstablishing credit terms offered can be thought of as a decision process similar to setting a price for products\nand services. Just as a price is the result of a market forces, so too are credit terms. If credit terms are not\n5\nCorporate Finance Institute. “What Are the 5 Cs of Credit?” n.d. https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/\ncredit/5-cs-of-credit/\n580\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompetitive within the industry, sales can suffer. Typically, companies follow standard industry credit terms. If\nmost companies in an industry offer a discount for early payments, then most companies will follow suit and\nalso offer an equal discount.\nOnce credit terms are established, they can be changed based on both marketing strategies and financial\nmanagement goals. For example, discounts for early payments can be more generous, or the full credit\nperiod can be extended to stimulate additional sales. Both discount periods and full credit periods can be\ntightened to try to speed up collections. The establishment of and changes to credit terms are usually made in\nconsultation with the sales and financial management departments.\nMonitoring Accounts Receivables\nFinancial managers monitor accounts receivables using some basic tools. One of those tools is the accounts\nreceivable aging schedule (report). To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account\nbalances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.\nAn account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on",

Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender).

Earlier in the\nchapter, the concept of the inventory conversion cycle was covered. The number of days that goods are held\nby a business is one of the focal points of inventory management.\nManagers look to minimize inventory balances and raise inventory turnover ratios while trying to balance the\nneeds of operations and sales. Purchasing personnel need to order enough inventory to “feed” production or\nto stock the shelves. The sales force wants to meet or surpass their sales budgets, and the operations people\nneed inventory for the factories, warehouses, and e-commerce sites.\nThe days in inventory ratio measures the average number of days between acquiring inventory (i.e.,\npurchasing merchandise) and its sale. This ratio is a metric to be watched and monitored by inventory\nmanagers and, if possible, minimized. A high days in inventory ratio could mean “aging” inventory. Old\ninventory could mean obsolesce or, in the case of perishable goods, spoilage. In either case, old inventory\nmeans losses.\nImagine a company selling high-tech products such as consumer electronics. A high days in inventory ratio\ncould mean that technologically obsolete products will be sold at a discount. There are similar issues with\nolder inventory in the fashion industry. Last year’s styles are not as appealing to the fashion-conscious\nconsumer and are usually sold at significant discounts. In the accounting world, lower of cost or market value\nis a test of inventory value to determine if inventory needs to be “written down,” meaning that the company\ntakes an expense for inventory that has lost significant value. Lower of cost or market is required by Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to state inventory valuations at realistic and conservative values.\nInventory is a very significant working capital component for many companies, such as manufacturers,\nwholesalers, and retailers. For those companies, inventory management involves management of the entire\nsupply chain: sourcing, storing, and selling inventory. At its very basic level, inventory management means\nhaving the right amount of stock at the right place and at the right time while also minimizing the cost of\ninventory. This concept is explained in the next section.\nInventory Cost\nControlling inventory costs minimizes working capital needs and, ultimately, the cost of goods sold. Inventory\nmanagement impacts profitability; minimizing cost of goods sold means maximizing gross profit (Gross Profit\n= Net Sales Less Cost of Goods Sold).\nThere are four components to inventory cost:\n•\nPurchasing costs: the invoice amount (after discounts) for inventory; the initial investment in inventory\n19.5 • Inventory Management\n583\n•\nCarrying costs: all costs of having inventory in stock, which includes storage costs (i.e., the cost of the\nspace to store the inventory, such as a warehouse), insurance, inventory obsolescence and spoilage, and\neven the opportunity cost of the investment in inventory\n•\nOrdering costs: the costs of placing an order with a vendor; the cost of a purchase and managing the\npayment process\n•\nStockout costs: an opportunity cost incurred when a customer order cannot be filled and the customer\ngoes elsewhere for the product; lost revenue",

Some\nof the “inputs” to the cash budget are from the sales (collections of cash), purchases (payments), and the\noperating expense budget (cash expenditures for selling and administrative expenses). A sample cash budget\nand a discussion of its preparation follows in the next section of this chapter.\n586\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSample Cash Budget\nA cash budget is the last budget to be prepared and is often part of the financial budget (cash budget,\nbudgeted income statement, and budgeted balance sheet). The purpose of the cash budget is to estimate\ncash flows, to help ensure sufficient cash balances are maintained during the planning period, and to plan for\nexternal financing during periods of cash deficits.\nWhen a budget is prepared in Excel, cash budget analysts can play “what if” with different scenarios to see\nwhen cash surpluses and deficits are expected. Cash surpluses means that funds can be invested in\nmarketable securities to earn a rate of return, while cash deficits mean that financing, such as a line of credit,\nwill be necessary (assuming forecasts are accurate).\nAlthough the example shown in Figure 19.10 is a monthly cash budget, a cash budget could be prepared using\nany useful time elements: weekly, monthly, or quarterly.\nOne common practice is to use a rolling cash budget. A rolling cash budget is continually updated to add a\nnew budget period, such as a month’s amount of cash flow activity, as the most recent budgeted month\nexpires. For example, assume that a 12-month cash budget is prepared for a period covering January 20X1 to\nDecember 20X1. Once the month of January 20X1 has concluded, a 12-month planning period continues by\nadd January 20X2 to the last column of the budget. The rolling cash monthly budget is an extension of the\ninitial cash budget model, adding one month and thereby always extending cash flow projections one year\ninto the future.\nFigure 19.9 Operating Expenses Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n587\nFigure 19.10 Sample Cash Budget\nUsing Figure 19.9 as an example, Table 19.5 shows the formulas that form the skeleton of a monthly cash\nbudget.\nBeginning\nCash Balance\nThis is the amount of cash the company expects to have on the first day of the month. For\nexample, in Figure 19.10, cell B2 is the amount of cash on Jan. 1 to start the year (the planning\nperiod). The remaining beginning cash balances for the months February through December\nare the ending cash balances of the previous month. For example, February’s beginning cash\nbalance (C2) is referenced from cell B9 (ending cash balance for January).\nCash\nCollections\nThese are the projected cash inflows from collections from customers (accounts receivable),\ncash sales, and any other significant cash inflows, such as dividends and interest on\ninvestments or sale of fixed assets. For example, the Cash Collections shown in the Sample\nCash Budget (Figure 19.10) are referenced from the Sales and Collections Budget (Figure\n19.7). January’s Cash Collections (cell B3) in the Sample Cash Budget are from cell B12 of the\nSales and Collection Budget.\nCash\nDisbursements\nCash disbursements are the projected cash outflows, such as those for operating expenses\nand payment of payables. For example, Cash Disbursements in the Sample Cash Budget for\nJanuary (Figure 19.10) are the sum of January’s payments for purchases in the Purchases\nBudget (Figure 19.8, cell B3) and the January operating expenses (Operating Expenses\nBudget, Figure 19.9, cell B12).\nNet Cash Flow\nThe formula for net cash flow is For example, in Figure 19.10, the January Net Cash Flow is\ncalculated in cell B5.\nPreliminary\nEnding Cash\nBalance\nBeginning Cash Balance + or - Net Cash Flow.

The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables. The credit managers’ mantra rings true: “The\nolder the receivable, the greater the likelihood that the account will not be collected.”\n19.5 Inventory Management\nInventory, usually the least liquid of the current assets, presents its own set of management challenges.\nFinding the optimal level of inventory is probably more of an art than a science. JIT helps to reduce the\ninvestment in inventory and lower the costs of storage, but stockout costs can be very damaging to\nprofitability.\n19.6 Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\nShort-term plans of a business are funded with cash, with cash budgets being a critical tool of planning. The\ncash budget takes into account a target amount of cash, factoring in all the motives for holding cash. A cash\nbudget looks ahead—predicting cash inflows and outflows, allocating for minimum cash balances to be\nmaintained, and helping management determine short-term financing needed. Although it is the last budget\nprepared, the preparation of the cash budget is an important financial planning exercise of companies small\nand large.\nKey Terms\naccounts receivable aging schedule\na report that shows amounts owed by customers by the age of the\naccount, as measured by the number of days since the sale\nallowance for doubtful accounts\nan account that contains the estimated amount of accounts receivable\nthat will not be collected\nbad debt expense\nan expense that a business incurs as a result of uncollectible accounts receivables\nbankruptcies\nfederal court procedures that protect distressed businesses from creditor collection efforts\nwhile allowing the debtor firm to liquidate its assets or devise a reorganization plan\n590\n19 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbenchmarking\nthe process of performance analysis that involves comparing financial condition and\noperating results against a standard, called a benchmark\nbill of lading\na document that is a detailed list of a goods that have been shipped; a receipt given by the\ncarrier (shipping company) to the seller as evidence that the goods have been shipped to the buyer\ncarrying costs\nall costs associated with having inventory in stock including storage costs, insurance,",

It can also be used to identify best practices that could be implemented within an organization."

            "chunk": "to be translated to dollars. Because exchange rates are volatile, the dollar value of the asset will vary\ndepending on the day on which the translation takes place. If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,\nthen this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance. The loss is\ndue simply to changes in exchange rates and not the underlying profitability of the company.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers or its\nsales. Even a company that is not involved in international transactions can face this type of risk. Consider a\ncompany located in Mississippi that makes shirts using 100% US-grown cotton. All of the shirts are made in the\nUnited States and sold to retail outlets in the United States. Thus, all of the company’s expenses and revenues\nare in US dollars, and the company holds no assets outside of the United States.\nAlthough this firm has no financial transactions involving international currency, it can be impacted by\nchanges in exchange rates. Suppose the US dollar strengthens relative to the Vietnamese dong. This will allow\nUS retail outlets to purchase more Vietnamese dong, and thus more shirts from Vietnamese suppliers, for the\nsame amount of US dollars. Because of this, the retail outlets experience a drop in the cost of procuring the\nVietnamese shirts relative to the shirts produced by the firm in Mississippi. The Mississippi company will lose\nsome of its customers to these Vietnamese producers simply because of a change in the exchange rate.\nHedging\nJust as companies may practice hedging techniques to reduce their commodity risk exposure, they may\nchoose to hedge to reduce their currency risk exposure. The types of futures contracts that we discussed\nearlier in this chapter exist for currencies as well as for commodities. A company that knows that it will need\nKorean won later this year to purchase raw materials from a South Korean supplier, for example, can purchase\na futures contract for Korean won.\nWhile futures contracts allow companies to lock in prices today for a future commitment, these contracts are\nnot flexible enough to meet the risk management needs of all companies. Futures contracts are standardized\ncontracts. This means that the contracts have set sizes and maturity dates. Futures contracts for Korean won,\nfor example, have a contract size of 125 million won. A company that needs 200 million won later this year\nwould need to either purchase one futures contract, hedging only a portion of its needs, or purchase two\nfutures contracts, hedging more than it needs. Either way, the company has remaining currency risk.\nIn this next section, we will explore some additional hedging techniques.\nForward Contracts\nSuppose a company needs access to 200 million Korean won on March 1. In addition to a specified contract\nsize, currency futures contracts have specified days on which the contracts are settled. For most currency\nfutures contracts, this occurs on the third Wednesday of the month. If the company needed 125 million Korean\nwon (the basic contract size) on the third Wednesday of March (the standard settlement date), the futures\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n607\ncontract could be useful. Because the company needs a different number of Korean won on a different date\nfrom those specified in the standard contract, the futures contract is not going to meet the specific risk\nmanagement needs of the company.\nAnother type of contract, the forward contract, can be used by this company to meet its specific needs. A\nforward contract is simply a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of\ncurrencies at a future date. A company can approach its bank, for example, saying that it will need to purchase\n200 million Korean won on March 1. The bank will quote a forward rate, which is a rate specified today for the\nsale of currency on a future date, and the company and the bank can enter into a forward contract to\nexchange dollars for 200 million Korean won at the quoted rate on March 1.\nBecause a forward contract is a contract between two parties, those two parties can specify the amount that\nwill be traded and the date the trade will occur. This contract is similar to your agreeing with a hotel that you\nwill arrive on March 1 and rent a room for three nights at $200 per night. You are agreeing today to show up at\nthe hotel on a future (specified) date and pay the quoted price when you arrive. The hotel agrees to provide\nyou the room on March 1 and cannot change the price of the room when you arrive. With a forward contract,",
