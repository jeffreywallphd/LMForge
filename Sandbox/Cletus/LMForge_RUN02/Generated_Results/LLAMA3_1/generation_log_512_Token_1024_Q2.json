This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve. \n3. Explain how politics and law are related. \n4. Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws.",

In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)?

(A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past.

In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way.

By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery.

Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwould override previous federal or state statutes. \n \nOne example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-\ndolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico.

In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective.

This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process.

Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action.

Id., at 64, quoting Los \nAngeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707, n.13, 55 L. Ed. 2d 657, 98 S. Ct. \n1370 (1978). When the workplace is permeated with “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and \ninsult,” 477 U.S. at 65, that is “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s \nemployment and create an abusive working environment,” Title VII is violated. \n \nThis standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct \nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury. As we \npointed out in Meritor, “mere utterance of an…epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an \nemployee,” does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s",

So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission’s new regulations on this subject, see 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29 CFR §§ \n1609.1, 1609.2); see also 29 CFR § 1604.11 (1993). But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while \npsychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is \nrequired. \n \nIII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n37 \nForklift, while conceding that a requirement that the conduct seriously affect psychological well-\nbeing is unfounded, argues that the District Court nonetheless correctly applied the Meritor \nstandard. We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.” \n \nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nSo ordered. \n \nNote to Students \n \nThis was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case.

Laws and legal systems differ \nworldwide. The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government. The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law,",

If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business.

In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48",

Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill (who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good.

Originally intended as a guide for legislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced individually and by corporations. Bentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society would be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad consequences of each policy. He called this approach “the greatest happiness principle.” He believed that the happiness or pleasure of all individuals in a society should be counted equally when making a decision about what is the best policy. This is called “the greatest happiness for the greatest number.”"

The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole.

Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number.

A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job",

                    "answer": "Reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you were the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job because someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an exercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. The second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. A deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as a general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to lying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and is generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it depends on the preexistence of honesty. Similar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing most crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the gray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would save a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow employment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we should note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” emphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it if someone did this to me?”)."

If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it.

Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice. \n \nFrom a modern perspective, some of these virtues seem old-fashioned or even odd.

Then, \nassuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: \n1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions \nthat might be made here? \n2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made. \n3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision. \n4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values. \n5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which \ndecision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders. \n \nIt is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why. In Milton \nFriedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders. In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods \nMarket, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come \nfirst, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 \"Corporations \nand Corporate Governance\"). \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n62 \nThe Core Values \nHere are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nTrustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be \nsincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and \ndon’t betray a trust.

Keep promises—keep your word, honor your commitments, and pay your debts; return \nwhat you borrow. \n \nRespect: Judge people on their merits, not their appearance; be courteous, polite, appreciative, \nand accepting of differences; respect others’ right to make decisions about their own lives; don’t \nabuse, demean, mistreat anyone; don’t use, manipulate, exploit, or take advantage of others. \n \nResponsibility: Be accountable—think about the consequences on yourself and others likely to \nbe affected before you act; be reliable; perform your duties; take responsibility for the \nconsequences of your choices; set a good example and don’t make excuses or take credit for other \npeople’s work.

In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the same duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about corporations and social responsibility."

Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response.

The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment.

Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay.

But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs. The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year \nperiod.

Another effect is that it can lead to a lack of innovation, as companies may be hesitant to invest in new ideas or technologies that do not immediately pay off in terms of profits. Additionally, managing by the numbers can create a culture of fear and mistrust, as employees may feel pressure to meet unrealistic targets and may be afraid to speak up if they have concerns about the company's direction.

In the early 1990s, Sears was facing increasing competition from other retailers and was struggling to maintain its market share. In an effort to increase profits, the company's management began to focus on short-term financial targets, such as quarterly earnings growth. This led to a series of decisions that were not in the best interest of the company or its customers. For example, the company began to push its auto centers to sell more expensive repairs, even when they were not necessary. This led to a significant increase in customer complaints and a decline in customer satisfaction. Eventually, the company was forced to pay millions of dollars in fines and settlements for its unethical behavior."

Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992.

First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states.

Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior to any trial. \n2. Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial. \n \n \nThe early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex \nprocess of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A lawsuit will start \nwith the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the \ndefendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim). After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge. Motions in the \nearly stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to \ncompel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process. \n \nInitial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss \nThe first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings. These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail. Cases can be decided \non the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the \ncourt can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks.

(2) The defendant can move to \ndismiss the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to “state a claim on which relief can be \ngranted,” or on the basis that there is no subject matter jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, \nor on the basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is saying, in effect, \nthat even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by \nthe court. For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-\ncalled alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will \ndismiss the complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a \ndemurrer.) \n \nA third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment. If there is no triable \nquestion of fact or law, there is no reason to have a trial. For example, the plaintiff sues on a promissory \nnote and, at deposition (an oral examination under oath), the defendant admits having made no payment \non the note and offers no excuse that would be recognizable as a reason not to pay. There is no reason to \nhave a trial, and the court should grant summary judgment. \n \nDiscovery \nIf there is a factual dispute, the case will usually involve some degree of discovery, where each party tries \nto get as much information out of the other party as the rules allow.

The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years.

This is when the opposing attorney may become harsh, casting doubt on a witness’s \ncredibility, trying to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or not to be trusted. This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides.

There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue?

But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave.

Rudzewicz (Section 3.9 \n\"Cases\"). In that case, the court considered whether it was constitutionally correct for a court to assert \npersonal jurisdiction over a nonresident. The states cannot constitutionally award a judgment against a \nnonresident if doing so would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Even if the \nstate’s long-arm statute would seem to allow such a judgment, other states should not give it full faith and \ncredit (see Article V of the Constitution). In short, a state’s long-arm statute cannot confer personal \njurisdiction that the state cannot constitutionally claim. \n \nThe Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) was originally meant to apply to federal \nactions only. During the twentieth century, the court began to apply selected rights to state action as well. \nSo, for example, federal agents were prohibited from using evidence seized in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment, but state agents were not, until Mapp v. Ohio (1960), when the court applied the guarantees \n(rights) of the Fourth Amendment to state action as well. In this and in similar cases, the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s due process clause was the basis for the court’s action. The due process clause commanded \nthat states provide due process in cases affecting the life, liberty, or property of US citizens, and the court \nsaw in this command certain “fundamental guarantees” that states would have to observe. Over the years, \nmost of the important guarantees in the Bill of Rights came to apply to state as well as federal action. The \ncourt refers to this process as selective incorporation. \n \nHere are some very basic principles to remember: \n \n1. The guarantees of the Bill of Rights apply only to state and federal government action. They do not limit \nwhat a company or person in the private sector may do. For example, states may not impose censorship \non the media or limit free speech in a way that offends the First Amendment, but your boss (in the \nprivate sector) may order you not to talk to the media. \n2.

While “states rights” was a battle cry of Southern states before the Civil War, the \nquestion of what balance to strike between state sovereignty and federal union has never been simple. \nIn Kimel v. Florida, for example, the Supreme Court found in the words of the Eleventh Amendment a \nbasis for declaring that states may not have to obey certain federal statutes. \n \nFirst Amendment \nIn part, the First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech, \nor of the press.” The Founding Fathers believed that democracy would work best if people (and the press) \ncould talk or write freely, without governmental interference. But the First Amendment was also not \nintended to be as absolute as it sounded. Oliver Wendell Holmes’s famous dictum that the law does not \npermit you to shout “Fire!” in a crowded theater has seldom been answered, “But why not?” And no one in \n1789 thought that defamation laws (torts for slander and libel) had been made unconstitutional. \nMoreover, because the apparent purpose of the First Amendment was to make sure that the nation had a \ncontinuing, vigorous debate over matters political, political speech has been given the highest level of \nprotection over such other forms of speech as (1) “commercial speech,” (2) speech that can and should be \nlimited by reasonable “time, place, and manner” restrictions, or (3) obscene speech. \n \nBecause of its higher level of protection, political speech can be false, malicious, mean-spirited, or even a",

Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional.

Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce \nimposed by Iowa’s law. On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests.",

The Clause requires that some aspects of trade generally must remain free from \ninterference by the States. When a State ventures excessively into the regulation of these aspects of \ncommerce, it “trespasses upon national interests,” Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce.

It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local \nconcern. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350. For example, regulations that \ntouch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to \ninvalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited).

For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the \ntreasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve \nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within \n10 days. \n \nAnd that is just the beginning.

On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to \npoint out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials. \n \nRapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression—\ncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. \nToday, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. Soon, \nhowever, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide \ncitizens with significant information about political candidates and issues. Yet, §441b would seem to ban a \nblog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with \ncorporate funds. The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions \nbased on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech. \n \nDue consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is overruled. We return to the \nprinciple established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech on \nthe basis of the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the \npolitical speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations. \n \n[IV.

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president.

Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant.

For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job.

The disease is characterized by shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. It is a progressive disease and can lead to permanent lung damage. The disease is not limited to textile workers; it can affect anyone who works in an environment where cotton dust is present. The disease is not fatal, but it can be debilitating. It is important that textile companies take steps to protect their workers from byssinosis. This can be done by implementing dust control measures, such as using HEPA filters, and by providing training to workers on how to avoid exposure to cotton dust. Workers who are exposed to cotton dust should also be provided with regular medical check-ups to monitor their lung health. By taking these steps, textile companies can help to prevent their workers from developing byssinosis."

However, it is generally accepted that any costs imposed on the textile industry will have a negative impact on job growth in the sector. This is because any increase in costs will make it more difficult for textile manufacturers to compete with other industries, which could lead to job losses in the sector. Additionally, any increase in costs could also lead to higher prices for consumers, which could further reduce demand for textile products and lead to job losses. Therefore, while it is impossible to say with certainty what the net effect of imposing costs on the textile industry will be, it is likely that it will have a negative impact on job growth in the sector."

The market should adjust for these negative externalities by setting a reasonable standard that shares the burden between manufacturers and their employees. This can be done through a variety of means, such as requiring manufacturers to provide employees with protective equipment, setting limits on the amount of cotton dust that can be emitted into the air, or imposing fines on manufacturers who violate these standards. The burden should not be placed entirely on the manufacturer, as this would create a disincentive for them to produce the good or service.

The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be fair, citizens must \nhave clear notice of what is criminally prohibited. Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to \npunish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly \nvague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for \nvagueness.” \n \nWhat is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time.

You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws.

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny.

Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law.

The \npolice are permitted to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are not permitted to do so to \ninstigate crime. The distinction is usually made between a person who intends to commit a crime and one \nwho does not.

But if the police knock on \nthe door of one not known to be a drug user and persist in a demand that he purchase drugs from them, \nfinally overcoming his will to resist, a conviction for purchase and possession of drugs can be overturned \non the ground of entrapment. \n \nOther Excuses \nA number of other circumstances can limit or excuse criminal liability.

Describe the basic steps in pretrial criminal procedure that follow a government's determination to arrest \nsomeone for an alleged criminal act. \n2. Describe the basic elements of trial and posttrial criminal procedure. \n \n \nThe procedure for criminal prosecutions is complex. Procedures will vary from state to state. A \ncriminal case begins with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing from the scene; if \nthe defendant is not caught, a warrant for the defendant’s arrest will issue. The warrant is issued by a \njudge or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge of a specific crime against the \naccused. It is not enough for a police officer to go before a judge and say, “I’d like you to arrest \nBonnie because I think she’s just murdered Clyde.” She must supply enough information to satisfy \nthe magistrate that there is probable cause (reasonable grounds) to believe that the accused \ncommitted the crime. The warrant will be issued to any officer or agency that has power to arrest the \naccused with warrant in hand. \n \nThe accused will be brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing. The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money.",

The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law.

Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence. \n \n \nSearch and Seizure \nThe rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that \nmake up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.

When the officer arrived, she detected a strong odor of marijuana in Kumar's car and a small amount of marijuana in the glove compartment.

The right to counsel is much broader in this country, as the \nresult of Supreme Court decisions that require the state to pay for a lawyer for indigent defendants in \nmost criminal cases. \n \nCruel and Unusual Punishment \nPunishment under the common law was frequently horrifying.

Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment has become a source of \ncontroversy, first with the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1976 that the death penalty, as haphazardly applied \nin the various states, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.

Pivowar \ndid not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction. Later in the same month \nNathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan $5,000 and $4,000 \non the two houses. Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes \nagain. \n \nMills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar. Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office \nMrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation. After the mortgages had been recorded on \nDecember 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for $5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage \nformerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of $3,000. In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two \npersonal notes in the sums of $5,250.00 and $4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan. \n \nAlthough the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did \nnot present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them.

Defendants \nmisconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses. Stated in a different form, their \nargument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second \nmortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan. \n \nDefendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction. \nRespectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit. A creditor has a \nright to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor. In the former \ncase, he has a right to know about the security. If he extends credit in reliance upon security which is \nfalsely represented to be adequate, he has been defrauded even if the debtor intends to repay the debt. His \nposition is now that of an unsecured creditor. At the very least, an unreasonable risk of loss has been \nforced upon him by reason of the deceit. This risk which he did not intend to assume has been imposed \nupon him by the intentional act of the debtor, and such action constitutes an intent to defraud. \n \n* * * \n \nThe cases cited by defendants in support of their contention are distinguishable from the instant case in \nthat they involved theft by larceny.

Most criminal law requires a specific \nintent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern \nlegislation, dispense with the requirement of intent). In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies. Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors. Most people have a \ngeneral notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft. But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act. It is usually easier to convict someone of attempt or conspiracy than to convict for the main \ncrime, and a person involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony may find that very little is required to put \nhim into serious trouble.",

Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5.

The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.

A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him.

Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions.

                    "answer": "Costs imposed on others without their consent can be problematic for a market economy because it can lead to inefficiencies and distortions in the allocation of resources. For example, if a business is forced to pay for damages caused by a tortfeasor, it may be unable to recoup those costs from its customers, leading to higher prices or reduced production. This can reduce overall economic efficiency and lead to a misallocation of resources. In a market economy, businesses are generally free to make decisions about how to allocate resources and set prices, so imposing costs on them without their consent can interfere with their ability to operate efficiently. If the law did not try to reimpose the victim’s costs onto the tortfeasor, it could lead to a situation where tortfeasors are not held accountable for their actions and are able to avoid paying for the damages they cause. This could lead to a decrease in overall economic efficiency and a misallocation of resources. A totally nonlitigious society would be one where people are not held legally responsible for their actions, even if they cause harm to others.

Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

Roche’s sister and brother sued Howard \nStern and Infinity broadcasting and were able to get past the defendant’s motion to dismiss to have a jury \nconsider their claim. \nA plaintiff’s burden in these cases is to show that the mental distress is severe. Many states require that \nthis distress must result in physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, ulcers, or, as in the case of the \npregnant wife, a miscarriage.

Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment. The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any \nstatements made in connection with legislative business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third \nperson, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the \nwarning, even though false. Likewise, an employee may warn an employer about the conduct or character \nof a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence \nor conduct of a child’s teacher. There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant with nothing but an \nidle interest in the matter (an “officious intermeddler”) must take the risk that his information is wrong. \n \nIn 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding \nthat under the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public official against a newspaper cannot \nstand unless the plaintiff has shown “actual malice,” which in turn was defined as “knowledge that [the \nstatement] was false or with a reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”[4] In subsequent cases, the \ncourt extended the constitutional doctrine further, applying it not merely to government officials but \nto public figures, people who voluntarily place themselves in the public eye or who involuntarily find",

Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot?

The plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining \nprecisely how the accident occurred. A defendant can always offer evidence that he acted reasonably—for \nexample, that the flour barrel was securely fastened and that a bolt of lightning, for which he was not \nresponsible, broke its bands, causing it to roll out the window. But testimony by the factory employees \nthat they secured the barrel, in the absence of any further explanation, will not usually serve to rebut the \ninference. That the defendant was negligent does not conclude the inquiry or automatically entitle the \nplaintiff to a judgment. Tort law provides the defendant with several excuses, some of which are discussed \nbriefly in the next section. \nExcuses \nThere are more excuses (defenses) than are listed here, but contributory negligence or comparative \nnegligence, assumption of risk, and act of God are among the principal defenses that will completely or \npartially excuse the negligence of the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n303 \nContributory and Comparative Negligence \nUnder an old common-law rule, it was a complete defense to show that the plaintiff in a negligence suit \nwas himself negligent. Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most of the fault being chargeable to \nthe defendant, the court would dismiss the suit if the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to his injury. In a few \nstates today, this rule of contributory negligence is still in effect. Although referred to as negligence, \nthe rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which the defendant is charged, because the \nplaintiff’s only error in such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have been, whereas the \ndefendant is charged with conduct careless toward others. This rule was so manifestly unjust in many \ncases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version \nof comparative negligence. Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned \naccording to the defendant’s degree of culpability. For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages. \n \nAssumption of Risk",

The evidence \namply supports a conclusion that trampoline use involves risks of serious injuries and that the potential \nfor an injury such as that experienced by Whitlock was foreseeable.

If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to \nsignify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we \nmay say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from \nStatus to Contract.

It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the \nfifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy \nwith all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, \ncommercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n330 \nContract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan.

Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law.

A \nrevision—the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979. \nThe Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, \nrestitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field.

This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity. A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on. However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet \nof one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods. The Code deals with phases of this \ntransaction from start to finish. These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: \n \n• \nSales (Article 2) \n• \nCommercial Paper (Article 3) \n• \nBank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) \n• \nLetters of Credit (Article 5) \n• \nBulk Transfers (Article 6) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n334 \n• \nWarehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) \n• \nInvestment Securities (Article 8) \n• \nSecured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) \n \nWe now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction. \nSales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined \n(Section 2-105) in part as “all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for",

Most states have enacted \nlegislation specifically providing that blood supplies to be used in transfusions are a service, not goods, \nthus relieving the suppliers and hospitals of an onerous burden. \n \nThree Basic Contract Types: Sources of Law \nWith this brief description of the UCC, it should now be clear that the primary sources of law for the three \nbasic types of contracts are: \n \n• \nReal estate: common law; \n• \nServices: common law; \n• \nSale of goods: UCC (as interpreted by the courts). \n \nCommon law and UCC rules are often similar. For example, both require good faith in the performance of \na contract. However, there are two general differences worth noting between the common law of contracts \nand the UCC’s rules governing the sales of goods. First, the UCC is more liberal than the common law in \nupholding the existence of a contract. For example, in a sales contract (covered by the UCC), “open” \nterms—that is, those the parties have not agreed upon—do not require a court to rule that no contract was \nmade. However, open terms in a nonsales contract will frequently result in a ruling that there is no \ncontract. Second, although the common law of contracts applies to every person equally, under the UCC \n“merchants” occasionally receive special treatment. By “merchants” the UCC means persons who have \nspecial knowledge or skill who deal in the goods involved in the transaction. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n336 \n \nThe Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods \nA Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) was approved in 1980 at \na diplomatic conference in Vienna.

When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing. For example, Tom \nowes Pete money, but Pete has waited too long to collect it and the statute of limitations has run out. The \ncontract for repayment is unenforceable and Pete is out of luck, unless Tom makes a new promise to pay \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n339 \nor actually pays part of the debt. (However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods).

Still, although there are \nnumerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out \ntheir contracts, the courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous \nline that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it.” By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the \npromisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, \nthough not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an \nincentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay. The purpose of \ncontract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to \nput the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach. \n \nCompensatory Damages \nOne party has the right to damages (money ) when the other party has breached the contract unless, of \ncourse, the contract itself or other circumstances suspend or discharge that \nright. Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester.

The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages.

Understand how the agency relationship is created. \n \n \nIntroduction to Agency Law \nWhy Is Agency Law Important, and What Is an Agent? \nAn agent is a person who acts in the name of and on behalf of another, having been given and assumed \nsome degree of authority to do so. Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—\nis carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships \nand other business organizations rely extensively on agents to conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each \npartner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the \ncorporation. \n \nThe existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature. He is said to \nhave been the first person from the Mayflower to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620; he was a carpenter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n372 \na cooper (barrel maker), and a diplomat. His agency task—of interest here—was celebrated in Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow’s “The Courtship of Miles Standish.” He was to woo Priscilla Mullins (d. 1680), \n“the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,” on behalf of Captain Miles Standish, a valiant soldier who was too shy \nto propose marriage. Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady. But Alden was so tongue-tied that his vaunted eloquence fell short, turned Priscilla cold toward",

These relationships can be summed up in a simple \ndiagram (see Figure 9.1 \"Agency Relationships\"). \n \nFigure 9.1 Agency Relationships \n \n \nIn this chapter, we will consider the principal-agent side of the triangle. In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer",

Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not",

But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees.

Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal.

A principal’s wishes may have been stated \nambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts \nreasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately \nrepudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to \nhim, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to \nliability to the principal.”[3] \n \nDuty Not to Attempt the Impossible or Impracticable \nThe principal says to the agent, “Keep working until the job is done.” The agent is not obligated to go \nwithout food or sleep because the principal misapprehended how long it would take to complete the job. \nNor should the agent continue to expend the principal’s funds in a quixotic attempt to gain business, sign \nup customers, or produce inventory when it is reasonably clear that such efforts would be in vain. \n \nDuty to Obey \nAs a general rule, the agent must obey reasonable directions concerning the manner of performance. \nWhat is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n385 \nprincipal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency.

The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent? \n4. Why were workers’ compensation statutes adopted in the early twentieth century?",

The principal \nconsents to the agent’s actions, and the third party may then rely on the document attesting to the agent’s \nauthority to deal on behalf of the principal.

The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it.

In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a \nnew logo for the hotel’s stationery.

(2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors. The plumber who rushes to a client’s house to repair a leak and causes a traffic accident does \nnot subject the homeowner to liability. But there are exceptions to the rule. Generally, these exceptions",

A million-dollar industrial accident is within the means of a company or its insurer; it is usually not within the means of the agent—employee—who caused it."

By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for \nvicarious liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be, doing—more or less—what she is \nsupposed to be doing, and the incident arose from the employee’s pursuit of the employer’s interest \n(again, more or less).

Is the owner liable? In many states, the \nowner is not liable; in other states, however, two approaches impose liability on the owner. \nThe first approach is legislative: owner’s consent statutes make the owner liable when the automobile \nis being driven with his consent or knowledge. The second approach to placing liability on the owner is \njudicial and known as the family purpose doctrine. Under this doctrine, a family member who \nnegligently injures someone with the car subjects the owner to liability if the family member was \nfurthering family purposes. These are loosely defined to include virtually every use to which a child, for \nexample, might put a car. In a Georgia case, Dixon v.

It \nalso makes sense that—as is the general rule—an agent is not liable on contracts she makes on the \nprincipal’s behalf; the agent is not a party to a contract made by the agent on behalf of the principal. No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.) But there are three exceptions to this rule: \n(1) if the agent is undisclosed or partially disclosed, (2) if the agent lacks authority or exceeds it, or (3) if \nthe agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity.

A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal.

Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal. Who may enforce the contracts against them? \n \nThe developer and the agents may sue to compel transfer of title. The undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal may act to enforce his rights unless the contract specifically prohibits it or there is a \nrepresentation that the signatories are not signing for an undisclosed principal. The agents may also bring \nsuit to enforce the principal’s contract rights because, as agents for an undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal, they are considered parties to their contracts. \n \nNow suppose the developer attempts to call off the deal. Whom may the sellers sue? Both the developer \nand the agents are liable. That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there \nwas a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may \nstill recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior \nto winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the \nplaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway.

The agency terminates if \nits purpose becomes illegal. \n \nEven though authority has terminated, whether by action of the parties or operation of law, the principal \nmay still be subject to liability.

Unless the principal put the agent up to committing the tort, \nthe agent will have to reimburse the principal. An agent is not generally liable for contracts made; the \nprincipal is liable.

An agency terminates expressly by the terms \nof the agreement or mutual consent, or by the principal’s revocation or the agent’s renunciation. An agency \nterminates impliedly by any number of circumstances in which it is reasonable to assume one or both of the \nparties would not want the relationship to continue. An agency will terminate by operation of law when one \nor the other party dies or becomes incompetent, or if the object of the agency becomes illegal.

The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460 \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit”) and retained the \ncommon-law theory that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals—the aggregate theory. \n \nRUPA moved more toward making partnerships entities. According to the NCCUL, “The Revised Act \nenhances the entity treatment of partnerships to achieve simplicity for state law purposes, particularly in \nmatters concerning title to partnership property. RUPA does not, however, relentlessly apply the entity \napproach. The aggregate approach is retained for some purposes, such as partners’ joint and several \nliability.” [4] Section 201(a) provides, “A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.” [5] \nEntity Characteristics of a Partnership \nUnder RUPA, then, a partnership has entity characteristics, but the partners remain guarantors of \npartnership obligations, as always—that is the partners’ joint and several liability noted in the previous \nparagraph (and discussed further in Chapter 12 \"Partnership Operation and Termination\"). This is a very \nimportant point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them \nis, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes \npersonal and unlimited liability. This personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished, \nsubject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and limited liability companies, as discussed \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". And, of course, the owners of corporations are also not generally \nliable for the corporation’s obligations, which is a major reason for the corporate form’s popularity. \n \nFor Accounting Purposes \nUnder both versions of the law, the partnership may keep business records as if it were a separate entity, \nand its accountants may treat it as such for purposes of preparing income statements and balance sheets. \n \nFor Purposes of Taxation \nUnder both versions of the law, partnerships are not taxable entities, so they do not pay income taxes. \nInstead, each partner’s distributive share, which includes income or other gain, loss, deductions, and",

Similarly, to sue a partnership, the plaintiff must name and sue each of the \npartners. This cumbersome procedure was modified in many states, which enacted special statutes \nexpressly permitting suits by and against partnerships in the firm name. In suits on a claim in federal \ncourt, a partnership may sue and be sued in its common name. The move by RUPA to make partnerships \nentities changed very little. Certainly it provides that “a partnership may sue and be sued in the name of \nthe partnership”—that’s handy where the plaintiff hopes for a judgment against the partnership, without \nrecourse to the individual partners’ personal assets. [6] But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and \nthe partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment \nagainst a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating \nthat partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in \npartnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership. [8] Under RUPA, \n“property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.” [9] But RUPA \nis no different from UPA in practical effect. The latter provides that “property originally brought into the \npartnership stock or subsequently acquired by purchase…on account of the partnership, is partnership",

For example, Carlos decides to paint houses during his summer break. He gathers some \nmaterials and gets several jobs. He hires Wally as a helper. Wally is very good, and pretty soon both of \nthem are deciding what jobs to do and how much to charge, and they are splitting the profits. They have \nan implied partnership, without intending to create a partnership at all. \n \nTests of Partnership Existence \nBut how do we know whether an implied partnership has been created? Obviously, we know if there is an \nexpress agreement. But partnerships can come into existence quite informally, indeed, without any \nformality—they can be created accidentally. In contrast to the corporation, which is the creature of \nstatute, partnership is a catchall term for a large variety of working relationships, and frequently, \nuncertainties arise about whether or not a particular relationship is that of partnership. The law can \nreduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price of severely restricting the flexibility of people to \nassociate. As the chief drafter of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA, 1914) explained, \n \nAll other business associations are statutory in origin. They are formed by the happening of an \nevent designated in a statute as necessary to their formation. In corporations this act may be the \nissuing of a charter by the proper officer of the state; in limited partnerships, the filing by the \nassociates of a specified document in a public office. On the other hand, an infinite number of \ncombinations of circumstances may result in co-ownership of a business. Partnership is the \nresiduum, including all forms of co-ownership, of a business except those business associations \norganized under a specific statute.

Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important. Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade. The paragraph also declared that upon \ndissolution of the partnership, ownership of items would revert to the party providing them. The third \nparagraph declared that the income of the partnership would be divided 30% for Chaiken, 70% for",

But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent, \ncoupled with the absence of profit sharing, they become strong factors in discrediting the partnership \nargument. Such weighing of the elements against a partnership finding compares favorably with Fenwick \nv. Unemployment Compensation Commission, which decided against the partnership theory on similar \nfacts, including the filing of partnership income tax forms. \n \nIn addition, the total circumstances of the case taken together indicate the employer-employee \nrelationship between Chaiken and his barbers. The agreement set forth the hours of work and days off—\nunusual subjects for partnership agreements. The barbers brought into the relationship only the \nequipment required of all barber shop operators. And each barber had his own individual “partnership”",

So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of \nother partners’ successes (and pay for their failures too).

The liability is a loan owing to the \npartner by the firm. \nRight to Return of Capital Contribution \nWhen a partner joins a partnership, she is expected to make a capital contribution to the firm; this may be \ndeducted from her share of the distributed profit and banked by the firm in its capital account. The law \nprovides that “the partnership must reimburse a partner for an advance of funds beyond the amount of \nthe partner’s agreed capital contribution, thereby treating the advance as a loan.” [10] A partner may get a \nreturn of capital under UPA after creditors are paid off if the business is wound down and terminated. [11] \n \nRight to Compensation \nSection 401(d) of RUPA provides that “a partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for \nthe partnership, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of \nthe partnership”; UPA Section 18(f) is to the same effect. A partner gets his money from the firm by \nsharing the profits, not by a salary or wages. \n \nRight to Management \nAll partners are entitled to share equally in the management and conduct of the business, unless the \npartnership agreement provides otherwise. [12] The partnership agreement could be structured to delegate \nmore decision-making power to one class of partners (senior partners) than to others (junior partners), or \nit may give more voting weight to certain individuals. For example, perhaps those with the most \nexperience will, for the first four years after a new partner is admitted, have more voting weight than the \nnew partner. \n \nRight to Choose Partners \nA business partnership is often analogized to a marriage partnership. In both there is a relationship of \ntrust and confidence between (or among) the parties; in both the poor judgment, negligence, or \ndishonesty of one can create liabilities on the other(s). In a good marriage or good partnership, the \npartners are friends, whatever else the legal relationship imposes.

The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights.

It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty? Section 28 of UPA and RUPA Section 504 permit a judgment creditor to obtain \na charging order, which charges the partner’s interest in the partnership with obligation to satisfy the \njudgment. The court may appoint a receiver to ensure that partnership proceeds are paid to the judgment \ncreditor. But the creditor is not entitled to specific partnership property. The partner may always pay off \nthe debt and redeem his interest in the partnership.

That is all the more true if he had a falling out with his partners and does not trust them. The solution is given in UPA Section 36(2), which says that an old partner is discharged from liability if the creditors and the new partnership agree to discharge him. Third, is Alice, the new partner, liable to creditors of the old partnership? Yes, but only to the extent of her capital contribution. [10] Fourth, is Baker, the old partner, liable for debts incurred after his withdrawal from the partnership? Surprisingly, yes, unless Baker takes certain action toward old and new creditors. He must provide actual notice that he has withdrawn to anyone who has extended credit in the past. Once he has done so, he has no liability to these creditors for credit extended to the partnership thereafter. Of course, it would be difficult to provide notice to future creditors, since at the time of withdrawal they would not have had a relationship with the partnership. To avoid liability to new creditors who knew of the partnership, the solution required under UPA Section 35(l)(b)(II) is to advertise Baker’s departure in a general circulation newspaper in the place where the partnership business was regularly carried on."

                    "answer": "RUPA’s use of the term dissociate has a significant bearing on the entity theory that informs the revised act. The term dissociate is used to describe the termination of a partner’s right to participate in the management of the partnership and to receive distributions from the partnership. This termination is a key feature of the entity theory, which views the partnership as a separate legal entity from its partners. Under this theory, the partnership has a legal existence independent of its partners, and the partners have no personal liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership. The use of the term dissociate in the revised act reinforces this concept by emphasizing that a partner’s termination from the partnership does not affect the legal existence of the partnership. This is in contrast to the previous act, which used the term withdrawal to describe a partner’s termination from the partnership. The term withdrawal implies that the partnership is merely a collection of partners, and that the termination of one partner affects the legal existence of the partnership. By using the term dissociate, RUPA reinforces the entity theory and emphasizes the separateness of the partnership from its partners."

It explores several \ntypes of associations that are hybrid forms—that is, they share some aspects of partnerships and \nsome of corporations. Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability, partnerships \nthe inestimable benefit of limited taxation. Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their \ntaxation. \n \nAt base, whether to allow businesspeople and investors to grasp the holy grail of limited liability is a \npolitical issue. When we say a person is “irresponsible,” it means he (or she, or it) does not take \nresponsibility for his harmful actions; the loss is borne by others. Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment. So the political trade-off \nwith allowing various inventive forms of business organization is between providing business actors \nwith the security that they will lose only their calculable investment, thus stimulating the economy,",

Some people feel that during the \nrun-up to the “Great Recession” of 2007–09, the economic system allowed too much risk taking. \nWhen the risky investments collapsed, though, instead of forcing the risk takers to suffer loss, the \ngovernment intervened—it “bailed them out,” as they say, putting the consequences of the failed \nrisks on the taxpayer. \n \nThe risk-averseness and inventiveness of businesspeople is seemingly unlimited, as is investors’ urge \nto make profits through others’ efforts with as little risk as possible. The rationale for the invention of \nthese hybrid business forms, then, is (1) risk reduction and (2) tax reduction.

A revised version, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), was adopted \nby the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1976 and further amended in 1985 and \nin 2001. \n \nThe 2001 act was \ndrafted for a world in which limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies can \nmeet many of the needs formerly met by limited partnerships.

Thus the trick for the LLC promoters is to \nlimit free transferability enough to pass the test of not being a corporation, but not limit so much as to \nmake it really difficult to divest oneself of the interest (then it’s not a very liquid or desirable investment). \n \nSome states’ LLC statutes have as the default rule that the remaining members must unanimously consent \nto allow an assignee or a transferee of a membership interest to participate in managing the LLC. Since \nthis prevents a member from transferring all attributes of the interest (the right to participate in \nmanagement isn’t transferred or assigned), the LLC formed under the default provision will not have “free \ntransferability of interest.” But if the LLC agreement allows majority consent for the transfer of all \nattributes, that also would satisfy the requirement that there not be free transferability of interests.

Many government \nprograms reflect peoples’ interest in adverting risk: federal deposit insurance, Social Security, and \nbankruptcy, to name three. And of course corporate limited liability has existed for two hundred \nyears. [6] Whether the movement to allow almost anybody the right to a business organization that affords \nlimited liability will encourage entrepreneurship and business activity or whether it will usher in a new \nera of moral hazard—people being allowed to escape the consequences of their own irresponsibility—is \nyet to be seen. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBusinesspeople always prefer to reduce their risks. The partnership form imposes serious potential risk: \nunlimited personal liability. The corporate form eliminates that risk but imposes some onerous formalities and \ndouble taxation. Early on, then, the limited partnership form was born, but it still imposed unlimited liability \non the general partner and on the limited partner if she became too actively involved. Congress was induced \nin the mid-1950s to allow certain small US corporations the right to single taxation, but the sub-S corporation \nstill suffered from various limitations on its structure. In the 1980s, the limited liability company was invented; \nit has become the entity of choice for many businesspeople, but its availability for professionals was limited. \nIn the late 1980s, the limited liability partnership form gained favor, and in the early 2000s, the limited liability \nlimited partnership finished off unlimited liability for limited partnerships. \n \nEXERCISES",

There can be no doubt that Defendants, in fact, controlled the corporation. However, they did so only in their capacities as agents for their principal, the corporate general partner. Although the corporation was a separate entity, it could act only through its board of directors, officers, and agents. [Citations] Plaintiff entered into the contract with Commercial. Defendants signed the contract in their capacities as president and secretary-treasurer of Union Properties, the general partner of Commercial. In the eyes of the law it was Union Properties, as a separate corporate entity, which entered into the contract with Plaintiff and controlled the limited partnership. Further, because Defendants scrupulously separated their actions on behalf of the corporation from their personal actions, Plaintiff never mistakenly assumed that Defendants were general partners with general liability. [Citations] Plaintiff knew Union Properties was the sole general partner and did not rely on Defendants’ control by assuming that they were also general partners. If Plaintiff had not wished to rely on the solvency of Union Properties as the only general partner, it could have insisted that Defendants personally guarantee contractual performance. Because Plaintiff entered into the contract knowing that Union Properties was the only party with general liability, and because in the eyes of the law it was Union Properties, a separate entity, which controlled the limited partnership, there is no reason for us to find that Defendants incurred general liability for their acts done as officers of the corporate general partner.

Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589",

The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by \nDelaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present \nday there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an \naddress on file with the secretary of state in Dover. \n \nDuring the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform \nBusiness Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws. About half of the states have adopted all or major portions of the act. The \n2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to \nthroughout our discussion of corporation law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of \nfinancial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-\nseventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England. The English Parliament successfully enacted the Bubble \nAct in 1720 to curb the formation of these companies; the restrictions weren’t loosened until over one \nhundred years later, after England viewed the success of corporations in its former colonies.

On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed. If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable.",

If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable. \n \nNow assume that the corporation is formed on October 15, and on October 18 it formally accepts all the \ncontracts that Bob signed prior to October 15. Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance. Under RMBCA, Section 6.20, however, a \nsubscription for shares is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement itself provides",

If the name is not \ndescriptive of the business or does not anticipate changes in the business, it may have to be changed, and \nthe change can be expensive. For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes.

The states are split on whether a de facto corporation results if every other \nlegal requirement is met. \n \nCorporation by Estoppel \nEven if the incorporators omit important steps, it is still possible for a court, under estoppel principles, to \ntreat the business as a corporation. Assume that Bob, Carol, and Ted have sought to incorporate the BCT \nBookstore, Inc., but have failed to file the articles of incorporation. At the initial directors’ meeting, Carol \nturns over to the corporation a deed to her property. A month later, Bob discovers the omission and \nhurriedly submits the articles of incorporation to the appropriate public office. Carol decides she wants \nher land back. It is clear that the corporation was not de jure at the time she surrendered her deed, and it \nwas probably not de facto either. Can she recover the land? Under equitable principles, the answer is no. \nShe is estopped from denying the existence of the corporation, because it would be inequitable to permit \none who has conducted herself as though there were a corporation to deny its existence in order to defeat \na contract into which she willingly entered. As Cranson v. International Business Machines Corp. \nindicates (Section 14.7.4 \"De Jure and De Facto Corporations\"), the doctrine \nof corporation by estoppel can also be used by the corporation against one of its creditors. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA court will find that a corporation might exist under fact (de facto), and not under law (de jure) if the \nfollowing conditions are met: (1) a statute exists under which the corporation could have been validly \nincorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a bona fide attempt to comply with the statute, and (3)",

CASE QUESTIONS 1. In what ways can operator liability attach to a parent corporation? How did the Sixth Circuit Court disagree with the district court’s analysis? Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org 618 2. Is direct liability for a parent company’s operation of the facility distinct from derivative liability for the subsidiary’s operation of the facility? Should the focus be on parent and subsidiary or on parent and facility? 3. What norms of corporate behavior does the court look to in determining whether an officer or a director is involved in the operation of a facility?"

As such, he is subject to the general rule that a promoter, although he may \nassume to act on behalf of a projected corporation and not for himself, will be held personally liable on \ncontracts made by him for the benefit of a corporation he intends to organize. This personal liability will \ncontinue even after the contemplated corporation is formed and has received the benefits of the contract, \nunless there is a novation or other agreement to release liability. \n \nThe imposition of personal liability upon a promoter where that promoter has contracted on behalf of a \ncorporation is based upon the principle that one who assumes to act for a nonexistent principal is himself \nliable on the contract in the absence of an agreement to the contrary.",

Towards this purpose he met with other interested individuals \nand an attorney and agreed to purchase stock and become an officer and director. Thereafter, upon being \nadvised by the attorney that the corporation had been formed under the laws of Maryland, he paid for and \nreceived a stock certificate evidencing ownership of shares in the corporation, and was shown the \ncorporate seal and minute book. The business of the new venture was conducted as if it were a \ncorporation, through corporate bank accounts, with auditors maintaining corporate books and records, \nand under a lease entered into by the corporation for the office from which it operated its business. \nCranson was elected president and all transactions conducted by him for the corporation, including the \ndealings with I.B.M., were made as an officer of the corporation. At no time did he assume any personal \nobligation or pledge his individual credit to I.B.M.

The second, the doctrine of estoppel to deny the corporate \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n623 \nexistence, is generally employed where the person seeking to hold the officer personally liable has \ncontracted or otherwise dealt with the association in such a manner as to recognize and in effect admit its \nexistence as a corporate body. \n \n* * * \n \nThere is, as we see it, a wide difference between creating a corporation by means of the de facto doctrine \nand estopping a party, due to his conduct in a particular case, from setting up the claim of no \nincorporation.

Where \nthere is a concurrence of the three elements necessary for the application of the de facto corporation \ndoctrine, there exists an entity which is a corporation de jure against all persons but the state. \n \nOn the other hand, the estoppel theory is applied only to the facts of each particular case and may be \ninvoked even where there is no corporation de facto. Accordingly, even though one or more of the \nrequisites of a de facto corporation are absent, we think that this factor does not preclude the application \nof the estoppel doctrine in a proper case, such as the one at bar. \n \nI.B.M. contends that the failure of the Bureau to file its certificate of incorporation debarred all corporate \nexistence. But, in spite of the fact that the omission might have prevented the Bureau from being either a \ncorporation de jure or de facto, Jones v. Linden Building Ass’n, we think that I.B.M. having dealt with the \nBureau as if it were a corporation and relied on its credit rather than that of Cranson, is estopped to assert \nthat the Bureau was not incorporated at the time the typewriters were purchased. In 1 Clark and Marshall, \nPrivate Corporations, § 89, it is stated: \n \nThe doctrine in relation to estoppel is based upon the ground that it would generally be \ninequitable to permit the corporate existence of an association to be denied by persons who have \nrepresented it to be a corporation, or held it out as a corporation, or by any persons who have \nrecognized it as a corporation by dealing with it as such; and by the overwhelming weight of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n624 \nauthority, therefore, a person may be estopped to deny the legal incorporation of an association \nwhich is not even a corporation de facto. \n \nIn cases similar to the one at bar, involving a failure to file articles of incorporation, the courts of other \njurisdictions have held that where one has recognized the corporate existence of an association, he is \nestopped to assert the contrary with respect to a claim arising out of such dealings. \n \nSince I.B.M. is estopped to deny the corporate existence of the Bureau, we hold that Cranson was not \nliable for the balance due on account of the typewriters. \n \nJudgment reversed; the appellee to pay the costs. \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS",

Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups. Generally, private equity firms that provide a lot \nof venture capital must be extremely savvy about the start-up plans of new businesses and must ask the \nstart-up entrepreneurs numerous challenging and pertinent questions. Such private equity firms expect a \nhigher rate of return on their investment than would be available from established companies. Today, \nventure capital is often used to finance entrepreneurial start-ups in biotechnology and clean technology. \n \nSometimes, a private equity firm will buy all the publicly traded shares of a company—a process \ncommonly termed “going private.” Private equity may also be involved in providing financing to \nestablished firms. \n \nAnother source of private equity is angel investors, affluent individuals who operate like venture \ncapitalists, providing capital for a business to get started in exchange for repayment with interest or an \nownership interest. The main difference between an angel investor and a venture capitalist is the source of \nfunds: an angel investor invests his or her own money, while venture capitalists use pooled funds. \n \nPrivate equity firms may also use a leveraged buyout (LBO) to finance the acquisition of another firm. \nDiscussed further in Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign \nCorporations, and Corporate Dissolution\" on Corporate Expansion, in the realm of private equity, an LBO \nis a financing option using debt to acquire another firm. In an LBO, private equity investors use the assets \nof the target corporation as collateral for a loan to purchase that target corporation. Such investors may \npursue an LBO as a debt acquisition option since they do not need to use much—or even any—of their own \nmoney in order to finance the acquisition. \n \nA major drawback to private equity, whether through a firm or through venture capital, is the risk versus \nreturn trade-off.

This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration.

When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on.

Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation.

Preferred shares also have a priority claim on the company's assets in the event of bankruptcy. This means that the shareholder will be paid before other shareholders in the event of a liquidation."

In most states, promissory notes and \ncontracts for future services are not lawful forms of consideration. The case United Steel Industries, Inc. \nv.

Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value?

This is in line with the business judgment rule, \ndiscussed in Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\".

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash.

The company will typically hire an underwriter to help it market the stock and determine the offering price. The underwriter will also help the company sell the stock to investors. After the stock is sold, the company will pay the underwriter a commission, which is typically a percentage of the total amount raised.

Gifts: A gift is not considered consideration, as it is not given in exchange for anything of value. 2. Barter: Barter is the exchange of goods or services for other goods or services, rather than for money. Barter is not considered consideration, as it is not given in exchange for money. 3. Services provided by a company's employees: Services provided by a company's employees are not considered consideration, as they are not given in exchange for anything of value. 4.

The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932.

Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent.

The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the \ndefinition in the 1933 and 1934 acts. Thus a security may be governed by the securities acts but not by the \nUCC. The definition of a private placement of securities also differs between the UCC and the securities \nacts. Other differences exist. [2] The UCC, as well as state-specific laws, and the federal securities laws \nshould all be considered in financial transactions. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe RMBCA advises doing away with financial concepts such as stock par value.

One method is to reinvest profits in the \ncorporation. Another method is to use private equity. Private equity involves financing from private \ninvestors, whether individuals (angel investors) or a private equity firm. Venture capital is often used as a \nfundraising mechanism by businesses that are just starting operations. \n \nA third method is to finance through debt, such as a loan or a bond. A corporation sells a bond and agrees \nto make interest payments over the life of the bond and to pay the face value of the bond at the bond’s \nmaturity. \nThe final important method of raising capital is by the sale of stock. The articles of incorporation govern \nthe total number of shares of stock that the corporation may issue, although it need not issue the \nmaximum. Stock in the hands of shareholders is said to be authorized, issued, and outstanding. Stock may \nhave a par value, which is usually the floor price of the stock. No-par shares may be sold for any price set \nby the directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n663 \nPreferred stock (1) may have a dividend preference, (2) takes preference upon liquidation, and (3) may be \nconvertible.

By placing 10,000 votes each on \ntwo of their candidates, they would be guaranteed two positions on the board.

Various formulas and computer programs are available to determine \nhow votes should be allocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting is \ndemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock—Bob and Carol—to elect 40 \npercent of the board. \n \nRMBCA Section 8.08 provides a safeguard against attempts to remove directors.

It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits. This ability has been \nfurther expanding as the concept of corporate social responsibility has grown, as discussed later in this \nsection. \n \nAlthough the other constituency statutes are not identically worded, they are all designed to release \ndirectors from their formal legal obligation to keep paramount the interests of shareholders. The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy.

MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc., the court ruled that the directors of Revlon had a duty to maximize shareholder value when selling the company. This duty is known as the Revlon duties. The case involved a leveraged buyout of Revlon by Forstmann Little. The court found that the directors of Revlon had breached their fiduciary duty to the shareholders by not maximizing shareholder value when selling the company. The court also found that the directors had not acted in good faith in negotiating the sale of the company to Forstmann Little.

Second, they make it more difficult for \nshareholders to monitor the performance of a company’s board; measuring decisions against the single \ngoal of profit maximization is far easier than against the subjective goal of “balancing” a host of competing \ninterests. Constituency statutes run contrary to the concept of shareholders as owners, and of the \nfiduciary duties owed to them, effectively softening shareholder power. Nevertheless, since many states \nnow have constituency statutes, it is only reasonable to expect that the traditional doctrine holding \nshareholder interests paramount will begin to give way, even as the shareholders challenge new decisions \nby directors that favor communities, employees, and others with an important stake in the welfare of the \ncorporations with which they deal.

While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties.

As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law. Delaware Code Section 102(b)(7), as mentioned previously, was \nenacted after Smith v. Van Gorkom (discussed in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\") and was prompted by an \noutcry about the court’s decision.

Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination. We address separately those two categories and the issues that \nthey generate.… \n \n…[The due care] argument is best understood against the backdrop of the presumptions that cloak \ndirector action being reviewed under the business judgment standard. Our law presumes that “in making \na business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the \nhonest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Those presumptions can be \nrebutted if the plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted \nin bad faith. If that is shown, the burden then shifts to the director defendants to demonstrate that the \nchallenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders.… \n \nThe appellants’ first claim is that the Chancellor erroneously (i) failed to make a “threshold \ndetermination” of gross negligence, and (ii) “conflated” the appellants’ burden to rebut the business \njudgment presumptions, with an analysis of whether the directors’ conduct fell within the 8 Del. C. § \n102(b)(7) provision that precludes exculpation of directors from monetary liability “for acts or omissions \nnot in good faith.” The argument runs as follows: Emerald Partners v. Berlin required the Chancellor first \nto determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted based upon a showing that \nthe board violated its duty of care, i.e., acted with gross negligence. If gross negligence were established, \nthe burden would shift to the directors to establish that the OEA was entirely fair. Only if the directors \nfailed to meet that burden could the trial court then address the directors’ Section 102(b)(7) exculpation \ndefense, including the statutory exception for acts not in good faith.",

They argue that the 2003 formulation was (and is) the correct definition, because it is \n“logically tied to board decision-making under the duty of care.” The post-trial formulation, on the other \nhand, “wrongly incorporated substantive elements regarding the rationality of the decisions under review \nrather than being constrained, as in a due care analysis, to strictly procedural criteria.” We conclude that \nboth arguments must fail. \n \nThe appellants’ first argument—that there is a real, significant difference between the Chancellor’s pre-\ntrial and post-trial definitions of bad faith—is plainly wrong. We perceive no substantive difference \nbetween the Court of Chancery’s 2003 definition of bad faith—a “conscious and intentional disregard [of] \nresponsibilities, adopting a we don’t care about the risks’ attitude…”—and its 2005 post-trial definition—\nan “intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities.” Both formulations \nexpress the same concept, although in slightly different language. \n \nThe most telling evidence that there is no substantive difference between the two formulations is that the \nappellants are forced to contrive a difference.

In approaching that question, we note that the Chancellor characterized that definition as \n“anappropriate (although not the only) standard for determining whether fiduciaries have acted in good \nfaith.” That observation is accurate and helpful, because as a matter of simple logic, at least three different \ncategories of fiduciary behavior are candidates for the “bad faith” pejorative label. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n705 \nThe first category involves so-called “subjective bad faith,” that is, fiduciary conduct motivated by an \nactual intent to do harm.

The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del. C. § 145. To \noversimplify, subsections (a) and (b) of that statute permit a corporation to indemnify (inter alia) any \nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses…where \n(among other things): (i) that person is, was, or is threatened to be made a party to that action, suit or \nproceeding, and (ii) that person “acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be \nin or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.…” Thus, under Delaware statutory law a",

A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. A failure to act in good faith may be \nshown, for instance, where the fiduciary intentionally acts with a purpose other than that of advancing the \nbest interests of the corporation, where the fiduciary acts with the intent to violate applicable positive law, \nor where the fiduciary intentionally fails to act in the face of a known duty to act, demonstrating a \nconscious disregard for his duties. There may be other examples of bad faith yet to be proven or alleged, \nbut these three are the most salient. \n \n…Second, the legislature has also recognized this intermediate category of fiduciary misconduct, which \nranks between conduct involving subjective bad faith and gross negligence.

Because the statute \nexculpates directors only for conduct amounting to gross negligence, the statutory denial of exculpation \nfor “acts…not in good faith” must encompass the intermediate category of misconduct captured by the \nChancellor’s definition of bad faith. \n \nFor these reasons, we uphold the Court of Chancery’s definition as a legally appropriate, although not the \nexclusive, definition of fiduciary bad faith.

The corporation may \nalways amend the articles of incorporation to change its purposes. Nevertheless, shareholders may enjoin \ntheir corporation from acting ultra vires, as may the state attorney general. However, an individual \nstockholder, director, or officer (except in rare instances under certain regulatory statutes) may not be \nheld vicariously liable if he did not participate in the crime or tort. \n \nBecause ownership and control are separated in the modern publicly held corporation, shareholders \ngenerally do not make business decisions.

[1] The Court said the test is whether “the person invests his \nmoney in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a \nthird party.” Under this test, courts have liberally interpreted “investment contract” and “certificate of \ninterest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement” to be securities interests in such property as real \nestate condominiums and cooperatives, commodity option contracts, and farm animals. \n \nThe Supreme Court ruled that notes that are not “investment contracts” under the Howey test can still be \nconsidered securities if certain factors are present, as discussed in Reves v. Ernst & Young, (see Section \n17.3.1 \"What Is a Security?\"). These factors include (1) the motivations prompting a reasonable seller and \nbuyer to enter into the transaction, (2) the plan of distribution and whether the instruments are \ncommonly traded for speculation or investment, (3) the reasonable expectations of the investing public, \nand (4) the presence of other factors that significantly reduce risk so as to render the application of the \nSecurities Act unnecessary. \n \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission \nFunctions \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is over half a century old, having been created by",

This case is also important in its discussion of the degree of reliance \ninvestors must prove to support a Rule 10b-5 action. \nIn 2000, the SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1, which defines trading “on the basis of” inside information as any \ntime a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. Therefore, a defendant is not saved \nby arguing that the trade was made independent of knowledge of the nonpublic information. However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v. O’Hagan, [7] and the SEC adopted the theory as \nnew Rule 10b5-2.

Requiring a plaintiff to show a speculative \nstate of facts, i.e., how he would have acted if omitted material information had been disclosed, or if the \nmisrepresentation had not been made, would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the \nRule 10b-5 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market. \n \nArising out of considerations of fairness, public policy, and probability, as well as judicial economy, \npresumptions are also useful devices for allocating the burdens of proof between parties.

The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company. This law requires issuers to keep accurate \nsets of books reflecting the dispositions of their assets and to maintain internal accounting controls to \nensure that transactions comport with management’s authorization. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 presents special hazards to those trading in public stock on the basis \nof inside information. One provision requires the reimbursement to the company of any profits made \nfrom selling and buying stock during a six-month period by directors, officers, and shareholders owning \n10 percent or more of the company’s stock.

Inventory arrives in trucks operated by the Flying Truckman Co., Inc. The BCT \ncorporation concludes that the economics of delivery do not warrant purchasing a single truck dedicated \nto hauling books for its four stores alone.

The general rule is that the purchasing corporation does not take the liabilities of the \nacquired corporation. Several exceptions exist, as described in Ray, the principal exception being the \nproduct-line approach. This minority exception has been further limited in several jurisdictions by \napplying it solely to cases involving products liability. Other jurisdictions also permit a continuity-of-\nenterprise exception, whereby the court examines how closely the acquiring corporation’s business is to \nthe acquired corporation’s business (e.g., see Turner v. Bituminous Casualty Co.).[2] \n \nMerger \nWhen the assets of a company are purchased, the selling company itself may or may not go out of \nexistence. By contrast, in a merger, the acquired company goes out of existence by being absorbed into the \nacquiring company. In the example in Section 18.1.2 \"Merger\", Flying Truck would merge into BCT, \nresulting in Flying Truckman losing its existence. The acquiring company receives all of the acquired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n749 \ncompany’s assets, including physical property and intangible property such as contracts and goodwill.

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt.

            "chunk": "question might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business.

The certificate may be filed as the corporation begins to wind up its \naffairs or at any time thereafter. The process of winding up is liquidation. The company must notify all \ncreditors of its intention to liquidate. It must collect and dispose of its assets, discharge all obligations, \nand distribute any remainder to its stockholders. \n \nInvoluntary Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n761 \nIn certain cases, a corporation can face involuntary dissolution. A state may bring an action to \ndissolve a corporation on one of five grounds: failure to file an annual report or pay taxes, fraud in \nprocuring incorporation, exceeding or abusing authority conferred, failure for thirty days to appoint and \nmaintain a registered agent, and failure to notify the state of a change of registered office or agent. State-\nspecific differences exist as well. Delaware permits its attorney general to involuntarily dissolve a \ncorporation for abuse, misuse, or nonuse of corporate powers, privileges, or franchise.

Some states have added additional exceptions, such \nas in cases involving products liability. \n \nIn a merger, the acquired company is absorbed into the acquiring company and goes out of business.

We then proceed to four \nfundamental issues that must be addressed to determine whether parties such as First Bank, in the \npreceding example, can collect: \n1. Is the paper negotiable? That is, is the paper in the proper form? We explore that issue in this \nchapter. \n2. Was the paper negotiated properly?

They fell into disuse after the collapse of the Roman Empire and \nthen reappeared in Italy around the fourteenth century. They became more common as long-distance \ncommerce spread. In an era before paper currency, payment in coins or bullion was awkward, especially \nfor merchants who traveled great distances across national boundaries to attend the fairs at which most \neconomic exchanges took place. Merchants and traders found it far more efficient to pay with paper. \n \nBills of exchange, today commonly known as drafts, were recognized instruments in the law merchant. \n(The “law merchant” was the system of rules and customs recognized and adopted by early-modern \ntraders and is the basis of the UCC Article 3.) A draft is an unconditional order by one person (the drawer) \ndirecting another person (drawee or payor) to pay money to a named third person or to bearer; a check is \nthe most familiar type of draft. The international merchant courts regularly enforced drafts and permitted \nthem to be transferred to others by indorsement (the legal spelling of endorsement). By the beginning of \nthe sixteenth century, the British common-law courts began to hear cases involving bills of exchange, but \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n779 \nit took a half century before the courts became comfortable with them and accepted them as crucial to the \ngrowing economy. \n \nCourts were also hesitant until the end of the seventeenth century about sanctioning a transferor’s \nassignment of a promissory note if it meant that the transferee would have better title than the transferor. \nOne reason for the courts’ reluctance to sanction assignments stemmed from the law that permitted \ndebtors to be jailed, a law that was not repealed until 1870.

The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law.

It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly.

If so, the rules of these other \narticles supersede the provisions of Article 3 to the extent of conflict. Article 3 is a set of general provisions \non negotiability; the other articles deal more narrowly with specific transactions or instruments. \n \nTypes of Commercial Paper \nThere are four types of commercial paper: drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit. \n \n \nDrafts \nA draft is an unconditional written order by one person (the drawer) directing another person (the \ndrawee) to pay a certain sum of money on demand or at a definite time to a named third person (the \npayee) or to bearer. The draft is one of the two basic types of commercial paper; the other is the note. As \nindicated by its definition, the draft is a three-party transaction. \n \nParties to a Draft \nThe drawer is one who directs a person or an entity, usually a bank, to pay a sum of money stated in an \ninstrument—for example, a person who makes a draft or writes a check. The drawer prepares a document \n(a form, usually)—the draft—ordering the drawee to remit a stated sum of money to the payee.

The most common drawee is a bank. The drawer, drawee, and payee need not be different people; the \nsame person may have different capacities in a single transaction. For example, a drawer (the person \nasking that payment be made) may also be the payee (the person to whom the payment is to be made). A \ndrawee who signs the draft becomes an acceptor: the drawee pledges to honor the draft as written. To \naccept, the drawee need only sign her name on the draft, usually vertically on the face, but anywhere will \ndo. Words such as “accepted” or “good” are unnecessary. However, a drawee who indicates that she might \nrefuse to pay will not be held to have accepted. Thus in the archetypal case, the court held that a drawee \nwho signed his name and appended the words “Kiss my foot” did not accept the draft. [1] \n \nThe drawer directs the funds to be drawn from—pulled from—the drawee, and the drawee pays the person \nentitled to payment as directed. \n \nTypes of Drafts \nDrafts can be divided into two broad subcategories: sight drafts and time drafts.",

In England and the British Commonwealth, drafts are called bills \nof exchange. Like a draft, a bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest. Used \nprimarily in international trade, it is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a \nspecific date sometime in the future. If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft. If \nit is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft. Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a \ndraft, but whereas a draft is always negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true \nof a bill of exchange. \n \nA widely used draft in international trade is the banker’s acceptance. It is a short-term credit \ninvestment created by a nonfinancial firm and guaranteed by a bank. This instrument is used when an \nexporter agrees to extend credit to an importer. \n \nAssume Love, the importer, is in New York; Rackets, the exporter, is in Taiwan. Rackets is willing to \npermit Love to pay ninety days after shipment. Love makes a deal with her New York bank to issue \nRackets’ bank in Taiwan a letter of credit. This tells the seller’s bank that the buyer’s bank is willing to \naccept a draft drawn on the buyer in accordance with terms spelled out in the letter of credit. Love’s bank \nmay insist on a security interest in the tennis rackets, or it may conclude that Love is creditworthy. On \nreceipt of the letter of credit, Rackets presents its bank in Taiwan with a draft drawn on Love’s bank. That \nbank antes up the purchase amount (less its fees and interest), paying Rackets directly. It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786",

As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay).

An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment.

For example, the note can state that the principal is $1,000 and the \ninterest is 11.5 percent, without specifying the total amount. Or the note could state the amount in \ninstallments: twelve equal installments of $88.25. Or it could state different interest rates before and after \na certain date or depending on whether or not the maker has defaulted; it could be determinable by a \nformula or by reference to a source described in the instrument. [2] It could permit the maker to take a \ndiscount if he pays before a certain date or could assess a penalty if he pays after the date. It could also \nprovide for an attorney’s fees and the costs of collection on default. If it is clear that interest is to be \nincluded but no interest amount is set, UCC Section 3-112 provides that it is “payable at the judgment rate \nin effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.” The fundamental \nrule is that for any time of payment, the holder must be able to determine, after the appropriate \ncalculations, the amount then payable. See Section 19.4 \"Cases\", Centerre Bank of Branson v. Campbell, \nfor a case involving the “fixed amount” rule. \n \nIn Money \nSection 1-201(24) of the UCC defines money as “a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a \ndomestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.” As long as the medium of exchange was such at \nthe time the instrument was made, it is payable in money, even if the medium of exchange has been \nabolished at the time the instrument is due. Section 3-107 provides the following as to payment in foreign \ncurrency: “Unless the instrument otherwise provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in \nforeign money may be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated by using \nthe current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the purchase of dollars on the day on which \nthe instrument is paid.” \n \nPayable on Demand or at a Definite Time \nAn instrument that says it is payable on sight is payable on demand, as is one that states no time for",

No, because the date the baby is due is \nuncertain. Is the note “Payable on January 1, but if the Yankees win the World Series, payable four days \nearlier” negotiable? Yes: this is a valid acceleration clause attached to a definite date. \nOne practical difference between a demand instrument and a time instrument is the date on which the \nstatute of limitations begins to run. (A statute of limitations is a limit on the time a creditor has to file a \nlawsuit to collect the debt.) Section 3-118(1) of the UCC says that a lawsuit to enforce payment at a definite \ntime “must be commenced within six years after the due date” (or the accelerated due date). For demand \npaper, an action must be brought “within six years after the demand.” \n \nPayable to Order or Bearer \nAn instrument payable to order is one that will be paid to a particular person or organization identifiable \nin advance.

Hotel Evans, Inc., [Citation] (1970), a note contained the notation “with \ninterest at bank rates.” Applying a section of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted by New York \nidentical to [3-104(a)] the court held the note was not a negotiable instrument in that the amount of \ninterest had to be established by facts outside the instrument. \n \nIn the instant case, the Campbells insist that it is impossible to determine from the face of the note the \namount due and payable on any payment date, as the note provides that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand.

Yes, the payee of an instrument is a holder, and can be a holder in due course, but the crux of \nnegotiable instruments involves taking an instrument free of defenses that might be claimed by anybody \nagainst paying on the instrument; the payee would know of defenses, usually, so—as the comment puts \nit—“use of the holder-in-due-course doctrine by the payee of an instrument is not the normal \nsituation.…[r]ather, the holder in due course is an immediate or remote transferee of the payee.” [2] \n \nLiability of Transferors \nWe discuss liability in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". However, a brief introduction to liability will \nhelp in understanding the types of indorsements discussed in this chapter. There are two types of liability \naffecting transferors: contract liability and warranty liability. \n \nContract Liability \nPersons who sign the instrument—that is, makers, acceptors, drawers, indorsers—have signed a contract \nand are subject to contract liabilities. Drafts (checks) and notes are, after all, contracts. Makers and \nacceptors are primary parties and are unconditionally liable to pay the instrument. Drawers and \nindorsers are secondary parties and are conditionally liable. The conditions creating liability—that is, \npresentment, dishonor, and notice—are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n813 \n \nWarranty Liability \nThe transferor’s contract liability is limited. It applies only to those who sign and only if certain additional \nconditions are met and, as will be discussed, can even be disclaimed. Consequently, a holder who has not \nbeen paid often must resort to a suit based on one of five warranties. These warranties are implied by law;",

If the check fell onto the floor, anybody could be a holder and cash it. It can easily be converted into \na check with special indorsement: City Water’s clerk need only add the words “Pay City Water” above \nRackets’ indorsement.

Before doing so, City Water could have negotiated it simply by giving it to someone (again, \na blank indorsement acts as bearer paper).

A depositary bank that takes it must deposit it as directed, or the bank has converted it. A payor bank \nthat is also the depositary bank that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter \nconverts it: the check cannot be cashed; it must be deposited (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\"). \n \nTo illustrate, suppose that Kate Jones indorses her paycheck “For deposit only, Kate Jones,” which is by \nfar the most common type of restrictive indorsement (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", right). A \nthief steals the check, indorses his name below the restrictive indorsement, and deposits the check in Last \nBank, where he has an account, or cashes it.

However, there are three important exceptions to this general rule: the imposter rule, the \nfictitious payee rule, and the dishonest employee rule. \n \nThe Imposter Rule \nIf one person poses as the named payee or as an agent of the named payee, inducing the maker or drawer \nto issue an instrument in the name of the payee to the imposter (or his confederate), the imposter’s \nindorsement of the payee’s name is effective. The paper can be negotiated according to the \nimposter rule. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n827 \nIf the named payee is a real person or firm, the negotiation of the instrument by the imposter is good and \nhas no effect on whatever obligation the drawer or maker has to the named payee. Lorna Love owes Steve \nSupplier $2,000. Knowing of the debt, Richard Wright writes to Love, pretending to be Steve Supplier, \nrequesting her to send a check to Wright’s address in Supplier’s name. When the check arrives, Wright \nindorses it by signing “Pay to the order of Richard Wright, (signed) Steve Supplier,” and then indorses it \nin his own name and cashes it. Love remains liable to Steve Supplier for the money that she owes him, and \nLove is out the $2,000 unless she can find Wright. \n \nThe difference between this case and the one involving the forger Carl Crooks is that in the second case \nthe imposter (Wright) “induced the maker or drawer [Lorna Love] to issue the instrument…by \nimpersonating the payee of the instrument [Steve Supplier]” (UCC, Section 3-404(a)), whereas in the first \ncase the thief did not induce Love to issue the check to him—he simply found it. And the rationale for \nmaking Lorna Love bear the loss is that she failed to detect the scam: she intended the imposter, Wright, \nto receive the instrument.

It says that if an employer \n“entrust[s] an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person \nacting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement \nis effective.” [4] For example (adapted from UCC 3-405, Official Comment 3; the Comment does not use \nthe names of these characters, of course), the duties of Abby Accountant, a bookkeeper, include posting \nthe amounts of checks payable to Lorna Love to the accounts of the drawers of the checks. Accountant \nsteals a check payable to Love, which was entrusted to Accountant, and forges Love’s indorsement. The \ncheck is deposited by Accountant to an account in the depositary bank that Accountant opened in the \nsame name as Lorna Love, and the check is honored by the drawee bank. The indorsment is effective as \nLove’s indorsement because Accountant’s duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes. \nThus Accountant is entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check. Neither the depositary bank \nnor the drawee bank is liable to Love for conversion of the check. The same result would follow if \nAccountant deposited the check in the account in the depositary bank without indorsement (UCC, Section \n4-205(a)). Under Section 4-205(c), deposit in a depositary bank in an account in a name substantially \nsimilar to that of Lorna Love is the equivalent of an indorsement in the name of Lorna Love.

As \na result, the stamp and some checks are stolen; Love bears any loss for being negligent. Similarly liable is \na person who has had previous notice that his signature has been forged and has taken no steps to prevent \nreoccurrences, as is a person who negligently mails a check to the wrong person, one who has the same \nname as the payee.

The defendant concedes that \n“there are no cases on point.” \n \nThe defendant is a private stock corporation incorporated and organized in New York as a non-profit \nracing association pursuant to [New York law]. The defendant owns and operates New York’s largest \nthoroughbred racetracks—Belmont Park Racetrack, Aqueduct Racetrack, and Saratoga Racetrack—where \nit stages thoroughbred horse races and conducts pari-mutuel wagering on them pursuant to a franchise \ngranted to the defendant by the State of New York. \n \nThe plaintiff was a Belmont Park Racetrack horse player. He attended the track and purchased from the \ndefendant a voucher for use in SAMS machines. As explained in [Citation]: \nIn addition to accepting bets placed at parimutuel facility windows staffed by facility employees, \n[some] facilities use SAMS. SAMS are automated machines which permit a bettor to enter his bet \nby inserting money, vouchers or credit cards into the machine, thereby enabling him to select the \nnumber or combination he wishes to purchase.

Rosenfeld never had any problems with Lunny’s bookkeeping before she resigned. \n• \nLunny exercised primary control over Victory’s bank accounts. \n• \nBetween 2001 and 2003, the checks that were generated to make payments to Victory’s vendors \nwere all computerized checks generated by Lunny. No other Victory employee, other than Lunny, \nknew how to generate the computerized checks, including Rosenfeld. \n• \nThe fraudulent checks were made payable to known vendors of Victory in amounts that were \nconsistent with previous legitimate checks to those vendors. \n•",

The payee defense is a common law doctrine that has been codified in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The UCC provides that a bank is not liable for paying a fraudulent check if it was made payable to the correct payee and the bank had no reason to believe that the check was fraudulent. This is because the bank is relying on the payee's representation that the check is legitimate. The payee defense is an important doctrine because it protects banks from liability for paying fraudulent checks and encourages banks to rely on the representations of their customers. However, the payee defense is not absolute and there are certain exceptions to the doctrine. For example, if the bank had actual knowledge that the check was fraudulent, it would not be protected by the payee defense. Additionally, if the bank had reason to believe that the check was fraudulent, it would not be protected by the payee defense.

This would ensure an additional control on checks that were \nlarger in amounts. Furthermore, Victory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each \nmonth. When any check was created by Victory’s computer system, the value of the check was \nautomatically assigned to a general ledger account before the check could be printed.

Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank.

It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the \ncheck jointly to Gill and Wisner as co-payees. Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that",

But a holder’s rights are ordinary, as we noted briefly in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of \nCommercial Paper\". If a person to whom an instrument is negotiated becomes nothing more than a \nholder, the law of commercial paper would not be very significant, nor would a negotiable instrument be a \nparticularly useful commercial device. A mere holder is simply an assignee, who acquires the assignor’s \nrights but also his liabilities; an ordinary holder must defend against claims and overcome defenses just as \nhis assignor would. The holder in due course is really the crux of the concept of commercial paper and the \nkey to its success and importance. What the holder in due course gets is an instrument free of claims or \ndefenses by previous possessors. A holder with such a preferred position can then treat the instrument \nalmost as money, free from the worry that someone might show up and prove it defective. \n \nRequirements for Being a Holder in Due Course \nUnder Section 3-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), to be a holder in due course (HDC), a \ntransferee must fulfill the following: \n1.

A holder in due course takes the instrument free of any right of the original parties thereto to rescind their contract for the instrument, and also free from any defect of title of prior parties and purchasers; also free from defenses available to prior parties, except those arising from fraud or illegality.

So a holder is one who \npossesses an instrument and who has all the necessary indorsements. \n \nTaken for Value \nSection 3-303 of the UCC describes what is meant by transferring an instrument “for value.” In a broad \nsense, it means the holder has given something for it, which sounds like consideration. But “value” here is \nnot the same as consideration under contract law. Here is the UCC language: \n \nAn instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply: \n \n(1) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the \npromise has been performed. \n(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien \nobtained by judicial proceeding. \n(3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim \nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n856 \n(4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. \n(5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable",

A purchaser with knowledge \ncannot become an HDC. But proving knowledge is difficult, so the UCC at Section 3-302(2) lists several \ntypes of notice that presumptively defeat any entitlement to status as HDC. Notice is not limited to receipt \nof an explicit statement; it includes an inference that a person should have made from the circumstances. \nThe explicit things that give a person notice include those that follow. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Is Overdue \nThe UCC provides generally that a person who has notice that an instrument is overdue cannot be an \nHDC. What constitutes notice? When an inspection of the instrument itself would show that it was due \nbefore the purchaser acquired it, notice is presumed. A transferee to whom a promissory note due April \n23 is negotiated on April 24 has notice that it was overdue and consequently is not an HDC. Not all paper \ncontains a due date for the entire amount, and demand paper has no due date at all. In Sections 3-\n302(a)(2) and 3-304, the UCC sets out specific rules dictating what is overdue paper. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Has Been Dishonored \nDishonor means that instrument is not paid when it is presented to the party who should pay it. \n \nWithout Notice of a Defense or Claim \nA purchaser of an instrument cannot be an HDC if he has notice that there are any defenses or claims \nagainst it. A defense is a reason why the would-be obligor will not pay; a claim is an assertion of \nownership in the instrument.

So a clever forgery would not by itself defeat the HDC status, unless the holder had notice of \nit. \n \nPayee as Holder in Due Course \nThe payee can be an HDC, but in the usual circumstances, a payee would have knowledge of claims or \ndefenses because the payee would be one of the original parties to the instrument. Nevertheless, a payee \nmay be an HDC if all the prerequisites are met. For instance, Blackstone fraudulently convinces \nWhitestone into signing a note as a comaker, with Greenstone as the payee. Without authority, Blackstone \nthen delivers the note for value to Greenstone. Having taken the note in good faith, for value, without \nnotice of any problems, and without cause to question its validity because of apparent irregularities, \nGreenstone is an HDC. In any event, typically the HDC is not the payee of the instrument, but rather, is an \nimmediate or remote transferee of the payee. \n \nThe Shelter Rule \nThere is one last point to mention before we get to the real nub of the holder-in-due-course concept (that \nthe sins of her predecessors are washed away for an HDC).

For three reasons: he did not take the \ninstrument for value (it was a gift), he did not take in good faith (he knew of the fraud), and he had notice \n(he acquired it after the due date). Nevertheless, Al is entitled to collect from Harold the full $250,000. \nHis right to do so flows from UCC, Section 3-203(b): “Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the \ntransfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, \nincluding any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due \ncourse by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument.” \n \nBy virtue of the shelter rule, Al as transferee from Betsy acquires all rights that she had as transferor. \nClearly Betsy is an HDC: she paid for the instrument, she took it in good faith, had no notice of any claim \nor defense against the instrument, and there were no apparent irregularities. Since Betsy is an HDC, so is \nAl. His knowledge of the fraud does not undercut his rights as HDC because he was not a party to it and \nwas not a prior holder. Now suppose that after negotiating the instrument to Betsy, Clifford repurchased \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n861 \nit from her. He would not be an HDC—and would not acquire all Betsy’s rights—because he had been a \nparty to fraud and as a prior holder had notice of a defense.

As we have noted, though, negligence in the making or \nhandling of a negotiable instrument may cut off this defense against an HDC—as, for example, when a \ndrawer who uses a rubber signature stamp carelessly leaves it unattended. And notice, too, that Section 3-\n308 of the UCC provides that signatures are presumed valid unless their validity is specifically denied, at \nwhich time the burden shifts to the person claiming validity. These issues are discussed in Triffin v. \nSomerset Valley Bank, in Section 21.3 \"Cases\" of this chapter. \n \nBankruptcy \nDrawers, makers, and subsequent indorsers are not liable to an HDC if they have been discharged in \nbankruptcy. If they were, bankruptcy would not serve much purpose. \n \n \n \nInfancy \nWhether an infant’s signature on a negotiable instrument is a valid defense depends on the law of the \nstate. In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a \nparty. An alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration \nunless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. But a nonfraudulent alteration—for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n865 \nexample, filling in an omitted date or giving the obligor the benefit of a lower interest rate—does not \ndischarge the obligor.

If this were a \ncommercial transaction, the makers (the students) would still owe on the notes even if there was, as here, \na complete failure of consideration (called “paying on a dead horse”). But the students don’t have to pay. \n \nWhether the gym owner here committed fraud is uncertain, but the holder-in-due-course doctrine did \noften work to promote fraud. Courts frequently saw cases brought by credit companies (factors) against \nconsumers who bought machines that did not work and services that did not live up to their promises. The \nancient concept of an HDC did not square with the realities of modern commerce, in which instruments \nby the millions are negotiated for uncompleted transactions. The finance company that bought such \ncommercial paper could never have honestly claimed (in the sociological sense) to be wholly ignorant that \nmany makers will have claims against their payees (though they could and did make the claim in the legal \nsense). \n \nActing to curb abuses, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1976 promulgated a trade regulation rule \nthat in effect abolished the holder-in-due-course rule for consumer credit transactions. Under the FTC \nrule titled “Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses,” [3] the creditor becomes a mere holder and \nstands in the shoes of the seller, subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the \nseller. Specifically, the rule requires the seller to provide notice in any consumer credit contract that the \ndebtor is entitled to raise defenses against any subsequent purchaser of the paper. It also bars the seller \nfrom accepting any outside financing unless the loan contract between the consumer and the outside \nfinance company contains a similar notice. (The required notice, to be printed in no less than ten-point, \nboldface type, is set out in Figure 21.3 \"Notice of Defense\".) The effect of the rule is to ensure that a",

[Citation] Thus, there are no concrete \ncommercial standards by which check-cashing businesses must operate. Moreover, Buckeye argues that \nits own internal operating policies do not require that it verify the availability of funds, nor does Buckeye \napparently have any guidelines with respect to the acceptance of postdated checks. Buckeye asserts that \ncashing a postdated check does not prevent a holder from obtaining holder-in-due-course status and cites \nseveral cases in support of this contention. All of the cases cited by Buckeye, however, were decided prior \nto the UCC’s addition of the objective prong to the definition of “good faith.” \n \nUnder a purely subjective “honesty in fact” analysis, it is clear that Buckeye accepted the check from Camp \nin good faith and would therefore achieve holder-in-due-course status. When the objective prong of the \ngood faith test is applied, however, we find that Buckeye did not conduct itself in a commercially \nreasonable manner. While not going so far as to say that cashing a postdated check prevents a holder from \nobtaining holder-in-due-course status in every instance, the presentation of a postdated check should put \nthe check cashing entity on notice that the check might not be good. Buckeye accepted the postdated \ncheck at its own peril. Some attempt at verification should be made before a check-cashing business \ncashes a postdated check. Such a failure to act does not constitute taking an instrument in good faith \nunder the current objective test of “reasonable commercial standards” enunciated in [the UCC]. \n \nWe conclude that in deciding to amend the good faith requirement to include an objective component of \n“reasonable commercial standards,” the Ohio legislature intended to place a duty on the holders of certain \ninstruments to act in a responsible manner in order to obtain holder-in-due-course status.

Plaintiff \nthen filed suit…to enforce Hauser Co.’s liability on the checks. The trial court granted plaintiff’s motion for \nsummary judgment. Hauser Co. appeals the grant of summary judgment.…We affirm. \n \nIn October 1998, Alfred M. Hauser, president of Hauser Co., was notified by Edwards Food Store in \nRaritan and the Somerset Valley Bank (the Bank), that several individuals were cashing what appeared to \nbe Hauser Co. payroll checks. Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments. Mr. Hauser \nconcluded that the checks were counterfeits because none of the payees were employees of Hauser Co., \nand because he did not write the checks or authorize anyone to sign those checks on his behalf. At that \ntime, Hauser Co. employed Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) to provide payroll services and a \nfacsimile signature was utilized on all Hauser Co. payroll checks. \n \nMr. Hauser executed affidavits of stolen and forged checks at the Bank, stopping payment on the checks at \nissue. Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn.

Judge Hoens concluded that because the \ncheck cashing companies took the checks in good faith, plaintiff was a holder in due course as assignee. \nJudge Hoens also found that because the checks appeared to be genuine, Hauser Co. was required, but \nhad failed, to show that plaintiff’s assignor had any notice that the checks were not validly drawn.… \n \nHauser Co. argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because the court failed to properly \naddress Hauser Co.’s defense that the checks at issue were invalid negotiable instruments and therefore \nerred in finding plaintiff was a holder in due course. \n \nAs a threshold matter, it is evident that the eighteen checks meet the definition of a negotiable instrument \n[UCC 3-104].

[Section 3-401(b) of the UCC] provides that a “signature may \nbe made manually or by means of a device or machine…with present intention to authenticate a writing.” \nIt is uncontroverted by Hauser Co. that the facsimile signature stamp on the checks is identical to Hauser \nCo.’s authorized stamp. \n \nHauser Co., however, contends that the checks are not negotiable instruments because Mr. Hauser did not \nsign the checks, did not authorize their signing, and its payroll service, ADP, did not produce the checks. \nLack of authorization, however, is a separate issue from whether the checks are negotiable instruments. \nConsequently, given that the checks are negotiable instruments, the next issue is whether the checks are \nunenforceable by a holder in due course, because the signature on the checks was forged or unauthorized.",

Honesty in fact is a subjective test, but the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards is objective. \n \nNotice is not limited to receipt of an explicit statement of defenses; a holder may be given notice through \ninferences that should be drawn from the character of the instrument. Thus an incomplete instrument, \none that bears marks of forgery, or one that indicates it is overdue may give notice on its face. Certain \nfacts do not necessarily give notice of defense or claim: that the instrument is antedated or postdated, that \nthe instrument was negotiated in return for an executory promise, that any party has signed for \naccommodation, that an incomplete instrument has been completed, that any person negotiating the \ninstrument is or was a fiduciary, or that there has been default in payment of interest or principal. \nA person who could not have become an HDC directly (e.g., because he had notice of a defense or claim) \nmay become so if he takes as transferee from an HDC as long as he was not a party to any fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument or had not previously been a holder with notice of a defense or claim. \nThis is the shelter rule. \n \nHolders in due course are not immune from all defenses.

Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES",

An instrument is also converted if a person pays an instrument on a \nforged indorsement: a bank that pays a check on a forged indorsement has converted the instrument and \nis liable to the person whose indorsement was forged. There are various permutations on the theme of \nconversion; here is one example from the Official Comment: \n \nA check is payable to the order of A.

Understand that independent of contract liability, parties to negotiable instruments incur warranty liability. \n2. Know what warranties a person makes when she transfers an instrument. \n3. Know what warranties a person makes when he presents an instrument for payment or acceptance. \n4. Understand what happens if a bank pays or accepts a check by mistake. \n \n \nOverview of Warranty Liability \nWe discussed the contract liability of primary and secondary parties, which applies to those who sign the \ninstrument. Liability arises a second way, too—by warranty. A negotiable instrument is a type of property \nthat is sold and bought, just the way an automobile is, or a toaster. If you buy a car, you generally expect \nthat it will, more or less, work the way cars are supposed to work—that’s the implied warranty of \nmerchantability. Similarly, when an instrument is transferred from A to B for consideration, the \ntransferee (B) expects that the instrument will work the way such instruments are supposed to work. If A \ntransfers to B a promissory note made by Maker, B figures that when the time is right, she can go to \nMaker and get paid on the note. So A makes some implied warranties to B—transfer warranties. And \nwhen B presents the instrument to Maker for payment, Maker assumes that B as the indorsee from A is \nentitled to payment, that the signatures are genuine, and the like. So B makes some implied warranties to \nMaker—presentment warranties. Usually, claims of breach of warranty arise in cases involving forged, \naltered, or stolen instruments, and they serve to allocate the loss to the person in the best position to have \navoided the loss, putting it on the person (or bank) who dealt with the wrongdoer. We take up both \ntransfer and presentment warranties. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n902 \n \nTransfer Warranties \nTransfer warranties are important because—as we’ve seen—contract liability is limited to those who have \nactually signed the instrument. Of course, secondary liability will provide a holder with sufficient grounds \nfor recovery against a previous indorser who did not qualify his indorsement. But sometimes there is no \nindorsement, and sometimes the indorsement is qualified. Sometimes, also, the holder fails to make \ntimely presentment or notice of dishonor, thereby discharging a previous indorsee. In such cases, the",

Section 3-605 is concerned with this kind of problem with \nPrincipal Debtor and Surety. But it has a wider scope: it also applies to indorsers who are not \naccommodation parties. Unless an indorser signs without recourse, the indorser’s liability under \nsection 3-415(a) is that of a surety. If Bank in our hypothetical case indorsed the note and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n911 \ntransferred it to Second Bank, Bank has rights given to an indorser under section 3-605 if it is \nSecond Bank that modifies rights and obligations of Borrower. \n \nDischarge by Reacquisition \nSuppose a prior party reacquires the instrument.

One example \ninvolves an employer who leaves a rubber stamp and blank checks accessible to an employee who later \ncommits forgery; another example involves a company that issues a ten dollar check but leaves a blank \nspace after the figure which allows the payee to turn the amount into ten thousand dollars; and the third \nexample involves an insurance company that mails a check to one policyholder whose name is the same as \nanother policyholder who was entitled to the check. In each case, the company’s negligence substantially \ncontributed to the alterations or forgeries by making it easier for the wrongdoer to commit the \nmalfeasance. \n \nIn the present case, we find no negligence in Farm Bureau’s delivery of the check to the Russells. There is \nnothing in the insurance policy that prohibits the insurer from making the loss-payment check jointly \npayable to the Russells and Conseco. Furthermore, under § 3-420, if a check is payable to more than one \npayee, delivery to one of the payees is deemed to be delivery to all payees.

We, \nhowever, do not. \n \n…Bank and its customer cannot through their contract define the meaning of the term “reasonable” and \nimpose it upon parties who are not in privity with that contract. Whether requiring a thumbprint \nconstitutes “reasonable identification” within the meaning of § 3-501(b)(2)(ii) is therefore a broader \npolicy consideration, and not, as argued in this case, simply a matter of contract.

Various rules govern the permutations of signatures when an \nagent and a principal are involved. \n \nThe maker of a note and the acceptor of a draft have primary contract liability on the instruments. \nSecondarily liable are drawers and indorsers. Conditions precedent to secondary liability are presentment, \ndishonor, and notice of dishonor. Under the proper circumstances, any of these conditions may be waived \nor excused. \n \nPresentment is a demand for payment made on the maker, acceptor, or drawee, or a demand for \nacceptance on the drawee. Presentment must be made (1) at the time specified in the instrument unless \nno time is specified, in which case it must be at the time specified for payment, or (2) within a reasonable \ntime if a sight instrument. \n \nDishonor occurs when acceptance or payment is refused after presentment, at which time a holder has the \nright of recourse against secondary parties if he has given proper notice of dishonor. \n \nA seller-transferor of any commercial paper gives five implied warranties, which become valuable to a \nholder seeking to collect in the event that there has been no indorsement or the indorsement has been \nqualified.

The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card.

The first is that a check may be \npresented to the payor bank for payment very quickly, perhaps in less than an hour: the customer’s “float” \ntime is abbreviated. That means be sure you have enough money in your account to cover the checks that \nyou write. The second consequence of Check 21 Act is that it is now possible for anybody—you at home or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n944 \nthe merchant from whom you are buying something—to scan a check and deposit it instantly. “Remote \ndeposit capture” allows users to transmit a scanned image of a check for posting and clearing using a web-\nconnected computer and a check scanner. The user clicks to send the deposit to the desired existing bank \naccount. Many merchants are using this system: that’s why if you write a check at the hardware store you \nmay see it scanned and returned immediately to you.

Not surprisingly, a desire for uniformity was the principal reason for the \nadoption of UCC Article 4. Article 4 absorbed many of the rules of the American Bankers Association Code \nand of the principles of the Deferred Posting statutes, as well as court decisions and common customs not \npreviously codified. \n \nBanks Covered \nArticle 4 covers three types of banks: depository banks, payor banks, and collecting banks. These terms—\nalready mentioned earlier—are defined in UCC Section 4-105. A depositary bank is the first bank to which \nan item is transferred for collection.

What is the effect of a “pay any bank” indorsement? The moment these words are indorsed on a \ncheck, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder. This restriction can be lifted whenever (a) the \ncheck has been returned to the customer initiating collection or (b) the bank specially indorses the \ncheck to a person who is not a bank (4-201). \n2. May a depositary bank supply a missing indorsement? It may supply any indorsement of the \ncustomer necessary to title unless the check contains words such as “payee’s indorsement required.” \nIf the customer fails to indorse a check when depositing it in his account, the bank’s notation that the \ncheck was deposited by a customer or credited to his account takes effect as the customer’s \nindorsement. (Section 4-205(1)). \n3. Are any warranties given in the collection process? Yes. They are identical to those provided in \nArticle 3, except that they apply only to customers and collecting banks (4-207(a)). The customer or \ncollecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants (1) \nhe is entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures are authorized authentic; (3) the item has not \nbeen altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment; (5) he has no knowledge \nof insolvency proceedings regarding the maker or acceptor or in the case of an unaccepted draft, the \ndrawer. These warranties cannot be disclaimed as to checks. \n4. Does the bank have the right to a charge-back against a customer’s account, or refund?

Section 4-213(1) spells out four events \n(whichever comes first) that will convert a payor bank’s provisional settlement into final settlement: \nWhen it (a) pays the item in cash; (b) settles without reserving a right to revoke and without having a right \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n946 \nunder statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement with the customer; finishes posting the item to the \nappropriate account; or (d) makes provisional settlement and fails to revoke the settlement in the time \nand manner permitted by statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement.

May the bank pay \nthe check and charge the customer’s account? Under Section 4-401(1), it may. Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n947 \n \nPayment of Deceased’s or Incompetent’s Checks \nSuppose a customer dies or is adjudged to be incompetent. May the bank honor her checks? Section 4-405 \npermits banks to accept, pay, and collect an item as long as it has no notice of the death or declaration of \nincompetence, and has no reasonable opportunity to act on it. Even after notice of death, a bank has ten \ndays to payor certify checks drawn on or prior to the date of death unless someone claiming an interest in \nthe account orders it to refrain from doing so. \n \n \n \nStop Payment Orders \nSection 4-403 expressly permits the customer to order the bank to “stop payment” on any check payable \nfor her account, assuming the stop order arrives in enough time to reasonably permit the bank to act on it. \nAn oral stop order is effective for fourteen days; a follow-up written confirmation within that time is \neffective for six months and can be renewed in writing.

Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT?

Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation. \n3. Recourse for loss or theft. If you notify the issuer of your EFT card within two business days after \nlearning that your card (or code number) is missing or stolen, your liability is limited to $50. If you \nfail to notify the issuer in this time, your liability can go as high as $500. More daunting is the \nprospect of loss if you fail within sixty days to notify the financial institution of an unauthorized \ntransfer noted on your statement: after sixty days of receipt, your liability is unlimited. In other \nwords, a thief thereafter could withdraw all your funds and use up your line of credit and you would \nhave no recourse against the financial institution for funds withdrawn after the sixtieth day, if you \nfailed to notify it of the unauthorized transfer. \n4.

These EFTs are ubiquitous, including ATMs, point-of-sale systems, direct deposits \nand withdrawals and online banking of various kinds. Responding to the need for consumer protection, \nCongress adopted the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, effective in 1978.

Or, to rephrase, it is a letter issued by a bank \nauthorizing the bearer to draw a stated amount of money from the issuing bank (or its branches, or other \nassociated banks or agencies). Originally, a letter of credit was quite literally that—a letter addressed by \nthe buyer’s bank to the seller’s bank stating that the former could vouch for their good customer, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n961 \nbuyer, and that it would pay the seller in case of the buyer’s default. An LC is issued by a bank on behalf of \nits creditworthy customers, whose application for the credit has been approved by that bank. \n \nSource of Law \nLetters of credit are governed by both international and US domestic law. \n \nInternational Law \nMany countries (including the United States) have bodies of law governing letters of credit. Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce. Suppose the parties do not stipulate a body of law for the agreement, and the \nvarious bodies of law conflict, what then? Julius is in New York and Rochelle is in Paris; does French law \nor New York law govern? The answer will depend on the particulars of the dispute. An American court \nmust determine under the applicable principles of the law of “conflicts of law” whether New York or \nFrench law applies. \n \nDomestic Law \nThe principal body of law applicable to the letter of credit in the United States is Article 5 of the UCC. \nSection 5-103 declares that Article 5 “applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations \narising out of transactions involving letters of credit.” The Official Comment to 5-101 observes, “A letter of \ncredit is an idiosyncratic form of undertaking that supports performance of an obligation incurred in a \nseparate financial, mercantile, or other transaction or arrangement.” And—as is the case in other parts of \nthe Code—parties may, within some limits, agree to “variation by agreement in order to respond to and \naccommodate developments in custom and usage that are not inconsistent with the essential definitions",

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount. On Thursday, the Bank deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade’s account.",

Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn. Although his order with the Lumber Company specifically provided for 4 x 6” runner boards, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n966 \nLumber Company used 2 x 6” boards. The Lumber Company “laminated” the two by six-inch boards to \nmake them stronger. However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn. Baker charged Meade approximately three hundred dollars to make \nthe necessary repairs. Baker testified that properly laminated two by six-inch boards are just as strong as \nfour by six-inch boards. \n \nMeade filed suit against the Bank in the trial court seeking $5,000 in damages.

[Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n967 \n[UCC 4-403(A)] provides that a customer may stop payment on any item drawn on the customer’s \naccount by issuing an order to the bank that describes the item with reasonable certainty and is received \nby the bank “at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before \nany action by the bank with respect to the item.” What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the \nfacts of the case. See Chute v. Bank One of Akron, (1983) [Citation] \n \nIn Chute, Bank One alleged that its customer, Mr. Chute, did not give it a reasonable opportunity to act \nupon his stop payment order when he gave an oral stop payment at one Bank One branch office, and a \ndifferent Bank One branch office paid the check the following day. In ruling that Bank One had a \nreasonable opportunity to act upon Mr. Chute’s order before it paid the check, the court considered the \nteller’s testimony that stop payment orders are entered onto the computer upon receipt, where they are \nvirtually immediately accessible to all Bank One tellers. \n \nIn this case, as in Chute, Meade gave notice one day, and the Bank paid the check the following day. \nAdditionally, in this case, the same branch that took the stop payment order also paid the check. \nMoreover, Evans testified that the Bank’s policy for stop payment orders is to enter them into the \ncomputer immediately, and that Meade’s stop payment order may have shown up on the computer on \nSaturday if she had entered it on Friday. Based on this information, and construing the facts in the light \nmost favorable to Meade, reasonable minds could conclude that Meade provided the Bank with the stop \npayment order within time for the Bank to act upon the stop payment order.

What debt collection practices third-party collectors may pursue \n \n \nThis chapter and the three that follow are devoted to debtor-creditor relations. In this chapter, we focus \non the consumer credit transaction. Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" and Chapter 26 \n\"Mortgages and Nonconsensual Liens\" explore different types of security that a creditor might \nrequire. Chapter 27 \"Bankruptcy\" examines debtors’ and creditors’ rights under bankruptcy law. \n \nThe amount of consumer debt, or household debt, owed by Americans to mortgage lenders, stores, \nautomobile dealers, and other merchants who sell on credit is difficult to ascertain. One reads that the \naverage household credit card debt (not including mortgages, auto loans, and student loans) in 2009 was \nalmost $16,000. [1] Or maybe it was $10,000. [2] Or maybe it was $7,300. [3]But probably focusing on \nthe average household debt is not very helpful: 55 percent of households have no credit card debt at all, \nand the median debt is $1,900. [4] \n \nIn 2007, the total household debt owed by Americans was $13.3 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve \nBoard. That is really an incomprehensible number: suffice it to say, then, that the availability of credit is \nan important factor in the US economy, and not surprisingly, a number of statutes have been enacted over \nthe years to protect consumers both before and after signing credit agreements. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n986 \nThe statutes tend to fall within three broad categories. First, several statutes are especially important \nwhen a consumer enters into a credit transaction. These include laws that regulate credit costs, the credit \napplication, and the applicant’s right to check a credit record. Second, after a consumer has contracted for \ncredit, certain statutes give a consumer the right to cancel the contract and correct billing mistakes. Third, \nif the consumer fails to pay a debt, the creditor has several traditional debt collection remedies that today \nare tightly regulated by the government. \n \n  \n \n[1] Ben Woolsey and Matt Schulz, Credit Card Statistics, Industry Statistics, Debt Statistics,August 24, \n2010, http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php. \nThis is “calculated by dividing the total revolving debt in the U.S. ($852.6 billion as of March 2010 data, as listed in",

A uniform state act, the Uniform \nConsumer Credit Code, as amended in 1974, is now on the books in twelve US jurisdictions, [3] though its \neffect on the development of modern consumer credit law has been significant beyond the number of \nstates adopting it. It is designed to protect consumers who buy goods and services on credit by \nsimplifying, clarifying, and updating legislation governing consumer credit and usury. \n \nGetting Credit \nDisclosure of credit costs is a good thing. After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check. And somebody who knows another person’s \ncreditworthiness has what is usually considered confidential information, the possession of which is \nsubject to abuse, and thus regulation. \n \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThrough the 1960s, banks and other lending and credit-granting institutions regularly discriminated \nagainst women. Banks told single women to find a cosigner for loans. Divorced women discovered that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n993 \nthey could not open store charge accounts because they lacked a prior credit history, even though they had \ncontributed to the family income on which previous accounts had been based. Married couples found that \nthe wife’s earnings were not counted when they sought credit; indeed, families planning to buy homes \nwere occasionally even told that the bank would grant a mortgage if the wife would submit to a \nhysterectomy! In all these cases, the premise of the refusal to treat women equally was the unstated—and \nusually false—belief that women would quit work to have children or simply to stay home. \n \nBy the 1970s, as women became a major factor in the labor force, Congress reacted to the manifest \nunfairness of the discrimination by enacting (as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974.

But in either case, \ncredit is a risk because the consumer may default; the creditor needs a means of collecting when the \ncustomer fails to pay. Open-end credit is usually given without collateral. The creditor can, of course, sue, \nbut if the consumer has no assets, collection can be troublesome. Historically, three different means of \nrecovering the debt have evolved: garnishment, wage assignment, and confession of judgment. \n \nGarnishment \nGarnishment is a legal process by which a creditor obtains a court order directing the debtor’s employer \n(or any party who owes money to the debtor) to pay directly to the creditor a certain portion of the \nemployee’s wages until the debt is paid. Until 1970, garnishment was regulated by state law, and its effects \ncould be devastating—in some cases, even leading to suicide. In 1970, Title III of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act asserted federal control over garnishment proceedings for the first time.

The rise in consumer debt in recent years has been matched by an increase in \nfederal regulation of consumer credit transactions. The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure of credit \nterms; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits certain types of discrimination in the granting of credit; \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act gives consumers access to their credit dossiers and prohibits unapproved \nuse of credit-rating information. After entering into a credit transaction, a consumer has certain \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1015 \ncancellation rights and may use a procedure prescribed by the Fair Credit Billing Act to correct billing \nerrors.

Figure 25.1 \n\"The Grasping Hand\" illustrates this scenario—the grasping hand is Creditor’s reach for the collateral, but \nthe hand will not close around the collateral and take it (repossess) unless Debtor defaults. \n \nFigure 25.1 The Grasping Hand \n \n \nSource of Law and Definitions \nSource of Law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1021 \nArticle 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs security interests in personal property. The \nUCC defines the scope of the article (here slightly truncated): [1] \n \nThis chapter applies to the following: \n1. A transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or \nfixtures by contract; \n2. An agricultural lien; \n3. A sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; \n4. A consignment… \n \nDefinitions \nAs always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is \npossible. The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a \nsecurity interest, and collateral. \n \nArticle 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1-201(35) \ndefines security interest as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or \nperformance of an obligation.” \n \nSecurity agreement is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract \nthat sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults. [2] \n \nCollateral “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.” [3] \n \nPurchase-money security interest (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest. Section 9-103(a) \nof the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money \nobligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the \ncreditor takes a secured interest in those goods.

It is \nwhat’s filed to establish the creditor’s “dibs.” \n \nContents of the Financing Statement \nIt may consist of the security agreement itself, as long as it contains the information required by the UCC, \nbut most commonly it is much less detailed than the security agreement: it “indicates merely that a person \nmay have a security interest in the collateral[.]…Further inquiry from the parties concerned will be \nnecessary to disclose the full state of affairs.” [26] The financing statement must provide the following \ninformation: \n \n• \nThe debtor’s name. Financing statements are indexed under the debtor’s name, so getting that \ncorrect is important. Section 9-503 of the UCC describes what is meant by “name of debtor.” \n• \nThe secured party’s name. \n• \nAn “indication” of what collateral is covered by the financing statement.[27] It may describe the \ncollateral or it may “indicate that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal \nproperty” (such generic references are not acceptable in the security agreement but are OK in the \nfinancing statement).

[31] Manufactured-home filings are good for thirty years. When the debtor’s obligation is satisfied, \nthe secured party files a termination statement if the collateral was consumer goods; otherwise—upon \ndemand—the secured party sends the debtor a termination statement.

Generally, an interest \nremains perfected until the earlier of when the perfection would have expired or for four months after the \ndebtor moves to a new jurisdiction. [33] \n \nWhere to File the Financing Statement \nFor most real-estate-related filings—ore to be extracted from mines, agricultural collateral, and fixtures—\nthe place to file is with the local office that files mortgages, typically the county auditor’s office. [34] For \nother collateral, the filing place is as duly authorized by the state. In some states, that is the office of the \nSecretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that \nmaintains the state’s filing system. [35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or \nher primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered \norganization. [36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is \nalready encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office \nwill provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available \nfor at least some types of collateral. \n \nExemptions \nSome transactions are exempt from the filing provision.

The law governing agreements for personal property security is \nArticle 9 of the UCC. The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest.

After \nattachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors \nclaim an interest in the collateral.

Who gets what when a debtor defaults? Depending on how the \npriorities in the collateral were established, even a secured creditor may walk away with the collateral or \nwith nothing. Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat.

Two requirements limit the creditor’s power to resell: (1) it must \nsend notice to the debtor and secondary obligor, and (unless consumer goods are sold) to other secured \nparties; and (2) all aspects of the sale must be “commercially reasonable.” [3] Most frequently the collateral \nis auctioned off. \n \nSection 9-615 of the UCC describes how the proceeds are applied: first, to the costs of the repossession, \nincluding reasonable attorney’s fees and legal expenses as provided for in the security agreement (and it \nwill provide for that!); second, to the satisfaction of the obligation owed; and third, to junior creditors. \nThis again emphasizes the importance of promptly perfecting the security interest: failure to do so \nfrequently subordinates the tardy creditor’s interest to junior status. If there is money left over from \ndisposing of the collateral—a surplus—the debtor gets that back. If there is still money owing—a \ndeficiency—the debtor is liable for that.

Unless the fiancée had a \nspecial status under the code provision protecting a bona fide buyer, without knowledge, for value, of \nconsumer goods, the failure to file a financing statement is not crucial.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets.

Firms summarize data and\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\n1.\nThe income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\n2.\nStatements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\n3.\nBalance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\ngovernment officials.

Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms.

The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC).

When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities.

These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements,\ncommercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too\nsmall to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs’ borrowing rates were affected by\nchanges in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and\nthey trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.\nTreasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where\ninvestors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills\nhas exceeded $75 billion.9\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as for inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to\n270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP\nmeans that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial\npaper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of\n2008.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue\ncommercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for\nCP.

However, typical\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD.

Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of\nconsumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like\nthis: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment\nadviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my\ninvestments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13\nmillion!”\nAn important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and\nlong-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be\navailable? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?\nWhen saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of\ncompounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low\ntolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start\na holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you\nhave funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.\nAn intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation\nhome. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment\nreturns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term\ninvestments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.\nLong-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and\nthe luxury of compounded returns over a long period.

In\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\nSome examples of these might include the following:\n•\nExpanding sales to existing customers\n•\nIncreasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\n•\nDeveloping new products for current and potential customers\n•\nBecoming international by setting up an online ordering service\nCorporate Structure and Governance\n2\n2 • Why It Matters\n39\n•\nImproving customer satisfaction with customer services\nIf managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in\nthe first place.

In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\n2.1\nBusiness Structures\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the business form created by most organizations.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\n•\nList and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized.

Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together.

A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.",

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders.

A director, on the other hand, is the\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\nmanagement.\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\npeople called subscribers.

The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase",

Boards are evolving from focusing primarily on the needs of top key individuals to\nconsidering broader aspects of ethics, values, and corporate culture. Boards now oversee the monitoring\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\n•\nconfirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\n•\nverifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\n•\nensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\nverifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\n•\ncoordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted.

Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors.

This could eventually result in declining bottom line results and company share\nprices, which would then lead to conflicts of interests between stockholders and company management.\nAn example of an agency problem between management and shareholders occurred at WorldCom in 2001,\nwhen their CEO used company assets to underwrite several personal loans.3 As a result of these inappropriate\nactions, the company took on additional debt that negatively impacted WorldCom’s capital structure, liquidity,\nand ultimately its stock price. From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\nInvestors versus Creditors\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\npossible default.\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\nstakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.\nIf such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the\norganization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the\ncompany as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus\nother stakeholders.\nA more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift\nbasket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.4 This was a direct result of the company\nbeing purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of",

When perpetuated, these differences may\neventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative\nthat they address the underlying problems of these differences. This will help ensure that normal business\noperations are not being adversely impacted by the agency problem.\nWhile there is no surefire way to resolve all conflicts of interest and agency problems, some measures that can\n52\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nhelp mitigate such issues include the following:\n•\nOffering incentives to management for strong performance and ethical behavior\n•\nAwarding decision makers with stock packages, commissions, and other long-term compensation\npackages to encourage long-term thinking and matching of company objectives with shareholders’\npriorities\n•\nPenalizing poor performance, shortsightedness, and unethical behavior\nThe prevailing belief in agency theory is that when a business creates organizational incentives that encourage\nhard work on projects that will benefit the company in both the short and long term, more employees will be\nencouraged to act in the business’s best interest.\nAnother means of resolving agency problems is through a hostile takeover of the organization. Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.",

These ratings and\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies.

Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).\nLet’s consider what the demand for pizza might look like. Suppose that at a price of $30 per pizza, no one will\npurchase a pizza, but if the price of a pizza is $25, 10 people might buy a pizza. If the price falls even lower,\nmore pizzas will be purchased, as shown in Table 3.1.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n0\n25\n10\n20\n20\n15\n30\n10\n40\n5\n50\nTable 3.1 Demand\nSchedule for Pizza\nThe information in Table 3.1 can be viewed in the form of a graph, as in Figure 3.2. Economists refer to the line\nin Figure 3.2 as a demand curve. When plotting a demand curve, price is placed on the vertical axis, and\nquantity is placed on the horizontal axis. Because more pizzas are bought at lower prices than at higher prices,\nthis demand curve is downward sloping. This inverse relationship is referred to as the law of demand.\n68\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 3.2 Demand Curve for Pizzas\nThe inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of a good sold occurs for two reasons.\nFirst, as you consume more and more pizza, the amount of happiness that one more pizza will bring you\ndiminishes. If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\npurchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing.

All\nother relevant economic factors are assumed to remain unchanged when the curve is drawn. If a factor such\nas the cost of cheese or the salaries paid to workers changes, then the supply curve will move. A shift to the\nright indicates that a greater quantity of pizzas will be provided by firms at a particular price; this would\nindicate an increase in supply.

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls.

You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n77\ndelivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows\neconomists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a\ntypical family’s purchases.\nIn an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods\npurchased and the purchasing habits of families, Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon founded the Billion\nPrices Project. Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world. The Billion Prices Project website\n(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project) provides measures for inflation using this data as well as\nresearch papers regarding macroeconomic research.\nHistorical Trends in the Inflation Rate\nInflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed in Figure 3.10. The graph shows that for the past\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.",

A country’s GDP is the dollar value of\nall of the final goods and service produced within that country during a year. GDP measures the value of all of\nthe automobiles produced, apples grown, heart surgeries performed, students educated, and all other new\ngoods and services produced in a current year.\nHow Is GDP Measured?\nGDP can be measured by adding up all of the items that are purchased in the economy. Purchases are divided\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\nexports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,\ncups of coffee, and clothing. Consumption expenditure accounts for about two-thirds of the US GDP.4\nInvestment spending refers primarily to purchases by businesses. It is important to note that in this context,\nthe term investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial securities. Instead, the\nterm refers to purchasing new capital goods, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment, that will be used\nto produce other goods. Residential housing is also included in the investment-spending category, as are\ninventories.

The investment\nspending category is roughly 15% to 18% of the US GDP.\nGovernment spending includes spending by federal, state, and local governments. Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported\nfrom other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because\nwe already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must\nsubtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation.

If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced.

The NBER is the entity that officially declares\nrecessions in the United States. Historically, a recession was defined as two consecutive quarters of declining\nGDP. Today, the NBER defines a recession in a broader, less precise manner; it will declare a recession when\nthere is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts for at least a few\nmonths.8 Measures of real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale and retail sales are\nconsidered in addition to real GDP.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research was founded in 1920 to create measures of economic activity\nthat could be used in public policy discussions. It is a private, nonpartisan organization that conducts\nresearch that is followed by businesses and the public sector. You can find out more about the NBER and\nview many of its research papers by visiting its website (https://openstax.org/r/nber-website).\nHistorical Trends\nThe NBER has identified business cycle peaks and troughs in data going back to the mid-19th century.

The concepts of supply, demand, and equilibrium apply in this\nmarket just as they do in other markets. This market is referred to as the market for loanable funds.\nIn the market for loanable funds, the suppliers of funds are economic entities that currently have a surplus in\ntheir budget. In other words, they have more income than they currently want to spend; they would like to\nsave some of their money and spend it in future time periods. Instead of just putting these savings in a box on\na shelf for safekeeping until they want to spend it, they can let someone else borrow that money. In essence,\nthey are renting that money to someone else, who pays a rental price called the interest rate.\nThe suppliers of loanable funds, also known as lenders, are represented by the upward-sloping curve in Figure\n3.17. A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\nborrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At that\ninterest rate, the quantity supplied of loanable funds exactly equals the quantity demanded of loanable funds.",

As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\nexposure. The ski lodge in Colorado will find that its customers from Mexico decrease when the dollar",

This risk refers to the uncertainty that businesses face when they engage in international trade and investment. Exchange rate risk can arise from changes in the exchange rate between two currencies, which can affect the value of a business's assets and liabilities. For example, if a business sells goods or services in a foreign currency, the value of those goods or services will change if the exchange rate between the two currencies changes. Similarly, if a business has assets or liabilities in a foreign currency, the value of those assets or liabilities will change if the exchange rate changes. Exchange rate risk can also arise from changes in the interest rates of two countries, which can affect the value of a business's investments. For example, if a business invests in a foreign currency, the value of that investment will change if the interest rates of the two countries change. Exchange rate risk can also arise from changes in the political and economic conditions of two countries, which can affect the value of a business's assets and liabilities.

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a",

The financial statements you will use in\nfinance are a part of the foundation for many decisions. They are an important tool. Even though you don’t\nhave to create financial statements in a finance role, it’s still necessary to understand the accounting principles\nthey are based on.

Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\nCash-Basis Accounting\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris",

For example, as you saw above, Chris\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\n102\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexpense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\nWho Uses Each Method?\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is",

In this section you will explore the impact business transactions have on\nfinancial statements under each method. In doing so, you’ll be introduced to double-entry accounting and\nsee how it functions to support the accounting equation.\nTiming of Business Activity versus Cash Flow\nThe first financial statement prepared is the income statement, a statement that shows the organization’s\nfinancial performance for a given period of time. We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a\nsummer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used\nthe cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was\nusing her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance\ncosts. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.\nThis balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and\ninsurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)",

While she would like the checking balance\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\n104\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSeptember rather than in August. In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,\na result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\nThe Accounting Equation\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance. Therefore, we must\nensure that the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. We will explore the components of the\naccounting equation in more detail shortly.

Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful to also think of net worth as the\naccounting value of the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and\nservices) increase the accounting value of the organization. So every dollar of revenue an organization\ngenerates increases the overall value of the organization.\n4.2 • Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\n105\nLikewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue) decrease the value of the organization. So\neach dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization. The same\napproach can be taken with the other elements of the financial statements:\n•\nGains increase the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nLosses decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nInvestments by owners increase the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nDistributions to owners decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nChanges in assets and liabilities can either increase or decrease the value (equity) of the organization\ndepending on the net result of the transaction.\nLet’s look at Chris’s Landscaping business again and do the same quick exercise you did with your personal\nfinances. If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s\ntractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset. Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash\nfor all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0. Using the\naccounting equation, we find her equity to currently be $250, or\nDouble-Entry Accounting\nAccounting is based on a double-entry accounting system, which requires the following:\n•\nEach time we record a transaction, we must record a change in at least two different accounts. Having two\nor more accounts change will allow us to keep the accounting equation in balance.\n•\nNot only will at least two accounts change, but there must also be at least one debit and one credit side\nimpacted.\n•\nThe sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits for each transaction.\nIn order for companies to record the myriad of transactions they have each year, there is a need for a simple",

Each of these categories, in turn, includes many individual accounts, all of which a\ncompany maintains in its general ledger. A general ledger is a comprehensive listing of all of a company’s\naccounts with their individual balances.\n4.3\nHow Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the revenue recognition principle and how it relates to current and future sales transactions.\n•\nExplain the expense recognition principle and how it relates to current and future purchase transactions.\n•\nAssess the role of ethics in revenue and expense recognition.\nYou’ve learned the basics of each method as well as the accounting equation and double-entry accounting.\nNext, let’s turn our attention to when we record transactions, as timing is key.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is the value of goods and services the organization sold or provided to customers for a given period\nof time. In our current example, Chris’s landscaping business, the “revenue,” or the value of services\n4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\n107\nperformed, for the month of August would be $1,400. It is the value Chris received in exchange for the services\nprovided to her clients. Likewise, when a business provides goods or services to customers for cash at the time\nof the service or in the future, the business classifies the amount(s) as revenue. Just as the $1,400 revenues\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In",

Liam has a lot of information to consider before making this decision.\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\n111\nWhat Is a Fixed Asset?\nAn asset is considered a tangible asset when it is an economic resource that has physical substance—it can\nbe seen and touched. Tangible assets can be either short term, such as inventory and supplies, or long term,\nsuch as land, buildings, and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset, the item needs to be\nused in the normal operation of the business for more than one year, be of material value, and not be near the\nend of its useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item in the near future. The useful life is\nthe time period over which an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known as fixed assets. It’s\nalso key to note that companies will capitalize a fixed asset if they have material value. A $10 stapler to be\nused in the office, for example, may last for years, but the value of the item is not significant enough to\nwarrant capitalizing it.\nBusinesses typically need many different types of these assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ\nfrom the company’s products. For example, the computers that Apple, Inc. intends to sell are considered\ninventory (a short-term asset), whereas the computers Apple’s employees use for day-to-day operations are\nlong-term assets. In Liam’s case, the new silk screen machine would be considered a long-term tangible asset\nas they plan to use it over many years to help generate revenue for their business. Long-term tangible assets\nare listed as noncurrent assets on a company’s balance sheet. Typically, these assets are listed under the\ncategory of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as fixed assets or plant assets.\nApple, Inc. lists a total of $36.766 million in total Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) on its September 2020\nconsolidated balance sheet (see Figure 4.7).

Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it\nis expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs\nover its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s\nfinancial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in\nexpenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense\nrecognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the\nrevenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over\nthe years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.\nAs stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated\ncosts on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,\nthey will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry in Figure 4.8).\nFigure 4.8 Journal Entry for Machine/Cash\nWhen capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This\nincludes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.\nFor example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the\nland would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.\nOver time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the\nasset.\n3\nIn the Chapter 4 financial statements, a number contained within parentheses is a negative number, such as the “Accumulated",

If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\ntypically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense.

Companies\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\nestimated useful life.\nRecording the Initial Asset\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years.

It is common and\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\nand increase annual net income.

The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000.

                    "answer": "The salvage value is the estimated value of an asset at the end of its useful life. It is an estimate of what the asset will be worth when it is no longer usable. For example, if a company purchases a piece of equipment for $50,000 and expects it to have a useful life of 5 years, with a salvage value of $5,000, the company would depreciate the asset over 5 years, with a depreciation expense of $9,000 per year."

Accumulated depreciation, on the other hand,\nrepresents the sum of all depreciation expense recognized to date, or the total of all prior depreciation\nexpense for the asset. It is a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account and is used to offset\nthe main account balance that records the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life. In this case,\nthe asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated\ndepreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet\nto show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense\nthrough depreciation.\nIt is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated. For example, land is not\ndepreciated because depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over its useful life. How can one\ndetermine a useful life for land? It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\naccounting courses.

However, “management teams typically fail to invest either time or attention into\nmaking or periodically revisiting and revising reasonably supportable estimates of asset lives or salvage\nvalues, or the selection of depreciation methods, as prescribed by GAAP.”5 This failure is not an ethical\napproach to properly accounting for the use of assets.\nAccountants need to analyze depreciation of an asset over the entire useful life of the asset. As an asset\nsupports the cash flow of the organization, expensing its cost needs to be allocated, not just recorded as an\narbitrary calculation. An asset’s depreciation may change over its life according to its use. If asset depreciation\nis arbitrarily determined, the recorded “gains or losses on the disposition of depreciable property assets seen\nin financial statements”6 are not true best estimates. Due to operational changes, the depreciation expense\nneeds to be periodically reevaluated and adjusted.\nAny mischaracterization of asset usage is not proper GAAP and is not proper accrual accounting. Therefore,\n“financial statement preparers, as well as their accountants and auditors, should pay more attention to the\nquality of depreciation-related estimates and their possible mischaracterization and losses of credits and\ncharges to operations as disposal gains.”7 An accountant should always follow GAAP guidelines and allocate",

The double-declining balance method is often used by companies in the fast food industry because it allows them to quickly recoup the cost of their assets through tax deductions. I agree with this choice because it allows McDonald’s to maximize its tax deductions and reduce its overall tax liability. By using the double-declining balance method, McDonald’s can quickly write off the cost of its assets and free up cash flow for other uses. This can be particularly beneficial for a company like McDonald’s, which has a high rate of asset turnover and needs to continually invest in new equipment and facilities to stay competitive."

While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses.

High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses.

Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\nthey are incurred.\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\nof-production methods.\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\noperations. Gains and losses, on the other hand, occur when the business does something they don’t normally\ndo (like sell a piece of their equipment) and earns or loses money on the transaction. It’s key to note that the\ntiming of cash flows can vary from the timing of recording revenues or expenses.

Thus, the statements are prepared in a\nspecific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\nrather than a net loss.\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\nfuture results.",

They begin with\ngross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and\n$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit.

Both assets\nand liabilities are broken down on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to\nprovide more detail and transparency as well as abide by the convention of reporting in descending order of\nliquidity. Current assets are those that can be used or converted to cash within a year. Common examples of\ncurrent assets include cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. Assets that will be in\nuse longer than a year are considered noncurrent. Common examples of noncurrent assets include notes\nreceivable, machinery and equipment, buildings, and land.\nJust as we noted a few key differences in the income statements based on the type of firm, you may also notice\na few slight differences in the balance sheet depending on the firm type. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a\nretailer. Thus, you will see that their inventory for resale on their balance sheet is simply called “Inventory.”\nThis is the goods they have purchased for resale but have not yet sold. A manufacturer, like Apple, Inc. in the\nLink to Learning sections, will have a variety of inventory types including raw materials, work in progress, and\nfinished goods inventory. These represent the various states of the inventory (ready to use, partially complete,\nand fully completed product). A service firm, on the other hand, may not have inventory at all. If it does, it may\nbe simple goods it uses to help deliver its service. For example, a cleaning company may keep an inventory of\ncleaning supplies.\nFigure 5.6 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\nnoncurrent.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has cash, accounts receivable, inventory, short-term investments, and equipment.\nIt rents its facilities, so it has no buildings on its balance sheets.

(Amounts are in\nmillions.)\nWe’ve covered the assets side of the accounting equation; now let’s turn our attention to the other side of the\nequation and the other two sections of the balance sheet: liabilities and equity. Just like the assets section, the\nliabilities section is broken down between current and noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be\ndue within a year. Common examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and\nunearned revenue. Noncurrent liabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future. Notes\npayable is a common noncurrent liability.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has accounts payable and has collected payments from a few customers that it\nhasn’t yet shipped its product to (unearned revenue). It also owes money on a note payable. Its accounts\npayable and unearned revenue are both current liabilities. The note payable is not due for several years, thus\nmaking it a noncurrent liability (see Figure 5.8).\nFigure 5.8 Liability Section of Classified Balance Sheet\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCurrent and Noncurrent Liabilities\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake\nSporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid\nout in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\nearnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced\nretained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning\nbalance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of\ntheir earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.\nFigure 5.10 Statement of Retained Earnings",

The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable?

Common stockholders normally have voting rights.\nPreferred stock has unique rights that are “preferred,” or more advantageous, to shareholders than common\nstock. Unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights and do not\nshare in the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the “preferred” classification entitles shareholders\nto a dividend that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared). Treasury stock is shares that were\noutstanding and have been repurchased by the firm but not retired. Thus they are still issued, but not\noutstanding. Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and par value of the common\nstock. For example, if a firm issued and sold stock at a market price of $20 that had a $5 par value, $5 for each\nshare would be recorded into common stock and the excess $15 per share would be recorded into the\nadditional paid-in capital account.\nIf we review the balance sheet for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see just two elements of equity: common\nstock and retained earnings.

The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income.

For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these\nare liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an\nincrease to the statement.",

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task.

A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements.

In Part II of the table of contents, find the MD&A report (page 20) and use the\ntable of contents link to navigate to it. What key highlights and challenges did the company report for the\nyear?\nSolution:\nAnswers may vary. A few key items of note might include risk factors, financial statements, the MD&A letter,\nand disclosures about market risk. Apple’s MD&A reported significant updates on the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a few financial updates, product updates, segment performance data, a conversation\nabout its debt, contractual obligations, and accounting policies.\nSEC Reporting Requirements\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded firms to regularly provide several\nreports. The two most common are the 10-K and quarterly report (10-Q). Certain unique events also require an\nadditional filing called an 8-K. There are many events that might require reporting. A few key examples include\nchanges to rights of shareholders, changes in control of the company, and amendments to the company",

It contains the firm’s financial\nstatements, required accounting disclosures, statements on internal control, and a management discussion\nand analysis (MD&A) letter. It does not contain an auditor’s report, as firms are not audited on a quarterly\nbasis. Quarterly reports are helpful to investors because they provide information on a timely enough basis to\nbe relevant.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInvestor Relations\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Most financial statements are\nprepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to\narrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other\nnonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.\n5.2 The Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly\ndepict and support the accounting equation:\nA classified balance\nsheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nThe financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is\nneeded in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of\nthe balance sheet.\n5.4 The Statement of Owner’s Equity\nThe statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,",

It allows shareholders to review the company's financial progress. An annual report typically includes a letter from the CEO, financial statements, and other information about the company."

The 10-K is an annual report that provides a comprehensive overview of a company's financial condition and operations. The 10-Q is a quarterly report that provides a more detailed look at a company's financial performance."

Beginning balances are provided, and all key\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\nneeds for growth.\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.\n5.8 Reporting Financial Activity\nPublicly traded firms must file company and financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\non a regular basis. Key reports include the quarterly report, called a 10-Q, and the annual report, called a 10-K.\n158\n5 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nKey Terms\naccounting equation\naccrual basis\naccounting system in which revenue is recorded or recognized when earned yet not\nnecessarily received, and in which expenses are recorded when legally incurred and not necessarily when\npaid\nassets",

It differs\ndepending on the role and perspective of those performing the analysis. For example, your personal\naccountant will have different goals and needs in making recommendations to you about your personal\nfinances. All accounting professionals use financial analysis to check for validity, accurate data, compliance in\nreporting, and more.\nSome tactics for managing your personal finances can be the same as for managing business finances. For\nexample, reducing expenses and maximizing returns on long-term investments are always good practices.\nDebt can also be a beneficial tool in both personal and professional finances when used appropriately. Debt is\nneither inherently good nor bad; it simply needs to be properly managed in order to achieve a reasonable\nreturn in exchange for the cost and risk it poses.\nThough the process and tools may be similar, financial analysis from a business perspective has different goals\nand needs.

As you watch the video about\nfinancial analysts (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-financial-analysts), consider your own career path\nand how your skills, abilities, and interests may fit this role.\n6.1\nRatios: Condensing Information into Smaller Pieces\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the importance of financial statement analysis in making informed decisions about business\nopportunities.\n•\nOutline the limitations of financial statement analysis in making investment decisions.\nWhen considering the outcomes from analysis, it is important for a company to understand that the data\ngenerated needs to be compared to similar data within the industry at large as well as that of close\ncompetitors. The company should also consider its past experience and how it corresponds to current and\nfuture performance expectations.\nImportance of Ratios and Analysis\nFinancial ratios help internal and external stakeholders make informed decisions about actions like investing,\nbecoming a supplier, making a loan, or altering internal operations, among other things. The information\nresulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success,\nset budget expectations, and compare industry competitors. There are four main types of ratios: liquidity,\nsolvency, efficiency, and profitability. While outcomes for some ratios may seem more ideal, the industry in\nwhich the business operates can change the influence of these outcomes on stakeholder decisions.",

                    "answer": "Financial statement analysis is a process of evaluating the financial statements of a business to assess its performance and financial position. It involves analyzing the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement to identify trends and patterns that can help management make informed decisions about the future of the business. Financial statement analysis can be used to assess a company's financial health, identify areas of strength and weakness, and make predictions about future performance. It can also be used to compare a company's performance to its competitors and industry benchmarks, as well as to evaluate the impact of various decisions and strategies on the company's financial performance."

                    "answer": "The four main types of financial ratios are liquidity ratios, solvency ratios, profitability ratios, and efficiency ratios. Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations, solvency ratios measure a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations, profitability ratios measure a company's ability to generate profits, and efficiency ratios measure a company's ability to use its resources effectively. Each type of ratio provides a different perspective on a company's financial health and can be used to identify areas of strength and weakness."

While outcomes for some ratios may seem more ideal, the industry in\nwhich the business operates can change the influence of these outcomes on stakeholder decisions.\nThere are several benefits to analyzing financial statements. The information can show trends over time, which\ncan help in making future business decisions. Converting information to percentages or ratios eliminates\nsome of the disparities between competitors’ sizes and operating abilities, making it easier for stakeholders to\nmake informed decisions. It can assist with understanding the makeup of current operations within the\nbusiness and which shifts need to occur internally to increase productivity.\nLimitation of Financial Statement Analysis\nThough useful, it’s important to note that there are limitations to financial statement analysis as well.\nStakeholders need to remember that past performance does not always predict future performance. Economic\ninfluences, such as inflation or a recession, could skew the data being analyzed. Additionally, the way a\ncompany reports information may change over time. For example, there could be changes in where and when\ncertain transactions are recorded, and this may not be immediately evident to financial statement users. It is\nalso key to note that though all publicly traded companies in the United States are required to follow Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), there are many estimates and flexibility in how some standards are\napplied. This means that firms can still follow accounting standards appropriately but present some\ninformation differently from other firms.\nIt makes good sense for a company to use financial statement analysis to guide future operations so it can\n166\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbudget properly, control costs, increase revenues, and make long-term expenditure decisions. As long as\nstakeholders understand the limitations of financial statement analysis, it is a useful way to predict growth and\nfinancial strength.\nDespite limitations, ratios are still a valuable tool if used appropriately.

Let’s examine\nfour efficiency ratios: accounts receivable turnover, total asset turnover, inventory turnover, and days’ sales\nin inventory.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover\nFor our discussion of financial statement analysis, we will look at Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Clear Lake\nSporting Goods is a small merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells them to\nconsumers) that sells hunting and fishing gear. Figure 6.2 shows the comparative income statements and\nbalance sheets for the past two years.\nFigure 6.2 Comparative Income Statements and Year-End Balance Sheets Note that the comparative income statements and\n6.2 • Operating Efficiency Ratios\n167\nbalance sheets have been simplified here and do not fully reflect all possible company accounts.\nTo begin an analysis of receivables, it’s important to first understand the cycles and periods used in the\ncalculations.\nOperating Cycle\nA period is one operating cycle of a business. The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the\naccounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make\ninventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of\nfishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle",

It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other",

Examples of the most liquid assets include\ncash, accounts receivable, and inventory for merchandising or manufacturing businesses. The reason these\nare among the most liquid assets is that these assets will be turned into cash more quickly than land or\nbuildings, for example. Accounts receivable represents goods or services that have already been sold and will\ntypically be paid/collected within 30 to 45 days.\nInventory is less liquid than accounts receivable because the product must first be sold before it generates\ncash (either through a cash sale or sale on account).

Most of the liabilities relate to debt that carries a covenant requiring that the company maintain a debt-to-equity ratio not exceeding 0.50. Determine the effect that each of the two options of obtaining additional capital will have on the debt covenant. Solution: We know the total liabilities for the firm to be $600,000. Using the accounting equation, we can find that the firm has $1,800,000 in equity. If the firm borrows $400,000, the debt-to-equity ratio changes to, which is 0.33, which is well below the requirement for the debt covenant. If the firm issues debt, the ratio changes to, which is 0.55 and would violate the debt covenant. If the firm chooses to issue "

In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value\ntomorrow.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will\npay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year\nfrom now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\nturns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is\n$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that\ntime. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the\nprincipal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\nBy taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a\ntotal value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to\n$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that\n$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss\ninterest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can\nconsider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds\nand/or charged to the borrower of these same funds. Following are a few more examples of the single-period\nscenario.\nIf a person deposits $300 in an account that pays 5% per year, at the end of one year, they will have\nIf a company has earnings of $2.50 per share and experiences a 10% increase in the following year, the\nearnings per share in year two are\nIf a retail store decides on a 3% price increase for the following year on an item that is currently selling for $50,\nthe new price in the following year will be\nThe Impact of Compounding\nWhat would happen if your friend were willing to wait one more year to receive their lump sum payment?\nWhat would the future dollar value in their account be after a two-year period?

Unfortunately, you\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\ncost after six years?\nSolution:\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\nvalue of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn\nor $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of\nor $105, in the account at the end of one\nyear.\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\nand five?\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\n195\nUsing the future value formula, the calculation is as follows:\nHow the Interest Rate Impacts Compounding\nMelvin likes the idea of earning more money over time, but he also believes that what he would earn in\ninterest may not be enough for some of the things he plans to buy in the future.

One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it\nis preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when\ninflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending\nmoney later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing\npower of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move\ninto the future.\nMost investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a\npayment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general\nprices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of\nnormal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value\nof financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\nmay be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than\ninflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.\nConversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\nas time goes by under such conditions.\nThe Impact of Inflation on TVM\nThe difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the\neffects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods\nand services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that\nincreasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services\navailable will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services.

Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to\nincreased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the\ncosts of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\nConsumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it\nnow, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a\ndecision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\ninflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in\ntimes when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing\npower erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\nnow in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through\ninterest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\nLower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed\nas the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on\nto sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money\nless expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and\nservices they may require.

This relationship of saving and planning\nfor the future is one of the most important reasons to understand the concept of the time value of money.\nNominal versus Real Interest Rates\nOne of the main problems of allowing inflation to determine interest rates is that current interest rates are\nactually nominal interest rates. Nominal rates are “stated,” not adjusted for the effects of inflation. In order to\ndetermine more practical real interest rates, the original nominal rate must be adjusted using an inflation\nrate, such as those that are calculated and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics within the consumer\nprice index (CPI).\nA concept referred to as the Fisher effect, named for economist Irving Fisher, describes the relationship\nbetween inflation and the nominal and real interest rates and is expressed using the following formula:\nwhere i is the nominal interest rate, R is the real interest rate, and h is the expected inflation rate.\nAn example of the Fisher effect would be seen in the case of a bond investor who is expecting a real interest\nrate of return of 6% on the bond, in an economy that is experiencing an expected inflation rate of 2%. Using\nthe above formula, we have\nSo, the nominal interest rate on the bond amounts to 8.12%, with a real interest rate of 6% within an economy\nthat is experiencing a 2% inflation rate. This is a logical result because in a scenario of positive inflation, a real\nrate of return would always be expected to amount to less than the stated or nominal rate.\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n217\nInterest and Savings\nSavings are adversely affected by negative real interest rates.

It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples",

So, this ends up being a bit of a\nrisk, but one that you have considered.

Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\nThe idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.\nTVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the\nfuture. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money\nearly can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects\nof inflation. Of course, it is important to remember that there will always be possible options that are sacrificed\nwith every option you decide on and every choice you make.\nKey Terms\nBureau of Labor Statistics\na group within the United States Department of Labor that is the primary fact-",

Unfortunately, many individuals then increase their spending habits in response,\njustifying a better car, a second home, or more lavish vacations. Wealth, in contrast, is comparable to taking a\nbucket of water from the river and holding it aside in a tank for oneself.

Decision-\nmakers consider how investments, projects, and even opportunity costs gain value as we move forward into\nthe future. They similarly consider how value in the future can be reduced to a value in present or past\nperiods. We saw that these value projections are called determination of future value (compounding, moving\nforward on a timeline) or present value (discounting, moving backward on a timeline). The easiest way to\nvisualize this movement through time, whether forward or backward, is by use of a timeline.\nThroughout the first chapter on the time value of money, we were analyzing a single amount.

Assume\nthat we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at the end of each year for five years, earning 7%\ncompounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\ninterest from past periods.\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we\ndeposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the\nbeginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at\nthe end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity.

Although we’ll gradually deplete the fund as we withdraw\nperiodic payments of the same amount, whatever funds remain in the account will always be earning interest.\n8.2 • Annuities\n231\nBefore we investigate a formula to calculate this amount, we can illustrate the objective: determining the\npresent value of this future stream of payments, either manually or using Microsoft Excel. We can take each of\nthe five payments of $25,000 and discount them to today’s value using the simple present value formula:\nwhere FV is the future value, PV is the present value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nFor example, the first $25,000 is discounted by the equation as follows:\nProof that $23,148.15 will grow to $25,000 in one year at 8% interest:\nIf we use this same method for each of the five years, increasing the exponent n for each year, we see the\nresult in Table 8.2.\nYear\nCalculation\nResult\n1\n$23,148.15\n2\n$21,433.47\n3\n$19,846.81\n4\n$18,375.75\n5\n$17,014.58\nTOTAL\n$99,818.76\nTable 8.2 Present Value of Future Payments\nWe begin with the amount calculated in our table, $99,818.76. Before any money is withdrawn, a year’s worth\nof interest at 8% is compounded and added to our balance. Then our first $25,000 is withdrawn, leaving us\nwith $82,804.26. This process continues until the end of five years, when, aside from a minor rounding\ndifference, the fund has “done its job” and is equal to zero. However, we can make this simpler. Because each\npayment withdrawn (or added, as we will see later) is the same, we can calculate the present value of an\nannuity in one step using an equation. Rather than the multiple steps above, we will use the following\nequation:\nwhere PVa is the present value of the annuity and PYMT is the amount of one payment.\nIn this example, PYMT is $25,000 at the end of each of five years. Note that the greater the number of periods\nand/or the size of the amount borrowed, the greater the chances of large rounding errors.

It’s important to note that rounding differences can\nbecome significant when dealing with larger multipliers, as in the financing of a multimillion-dollar machine or\nfacility. In this text, we will ignore them.\nIn conclusion, five payments of $25,000, or $125,000 in total, can be funded today with $99,817.81, with the\ndifference being obtained from interest always accumulating on the remaining balance at 8%. The running\nbalance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and\nsubtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year. In the last (fifth) year, just enough\ninterest will accrue to bring the balance to the $25,000 needed to complete the fifth payment.\nA common use of the PVa is with large-money lotteries.

The reason is that you can’t\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\nmoney. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives\non the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission",

When the result is expressed as a\npercent, it must be the same as the rate of interest used in the annuity calculations. Using our example of an\nannuity with five payments of $25,000 at 8%, we compare the present values of the ordinary annuity of\n$99,817.81 and the annuity due of $107,803.24.\nThe result shows that the present value of the annuity due is 8% higher than the present value of the ordinary\nannuity.\nCalculating the Future Value of an Annuity\nIn the previous section, we addressed discounting a periodic stream of payments from the future to the\npresent. We are also interested in how to project the future value of a series of payments. In this case, an\ninvestment may be made periodically. Keeping with the definition of an annuity, if the amount of periodic\ninvestment is always the same, we may take a one-step shortcut to calculate the future value of that stream by\nusing the formula presented below:\nwhere FVa is the future value of the annuity, PYMT is a one-time payment or receipt in the series, r is the\ninterest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nAs we did in our section on present values of annuities, we will begin with an ordinary annuity and then\nproceed to an annuity due.\nLet’s assume that you lock in a contract for an investment opportunity at 4% per year, but you cannot make\nthe first investment until one year from now.

Unsecured means that the loan\nis not secured by collateral but is instead based on the strong credit history of the borrower.\n•\nIn contrast, a secured personal loan has an asset backing up the unpaid amount, and if the consumer\ndefaults on the debt, the asset can be seized by the lender to satisfy their claim. A common example is an\nauto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the\nborrower’s car being repossessed.\n•\nA mortgage loan is another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even\n30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the\nborrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance\nremains on the debt.\n•\nStudent loans are borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a\nfinancial institution or the federal government. Interest rates on these loans are generally low and\nadvantageous, and repayment does not begin until after the borrower’s education is complete (or if they\ndrop below a certain level of time status, such as becoming a half-time student).\nCalculating Loan Payments Using Simple Amortization\nLoan amortization refers to a schedule of how and when a debt will be repaid with interest.

In many cases, this is\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples.

The practice of offering such loans can be controversial because it can lead to\nvery high rates of interest, perhaps even illegally high, in an act known as usury. Although some states have\noutlawed PALs and others place limits on them, some do not. A PAL is a short-term loan in anticipation of a\nperson’s next paycheck. A person in need of money for short-term needs will write a check on Thursday but\ndate the check next Thursday, which is their normal payday; assume this transaction is for $200. The lender,\ntypically operating from a storefront, will advance the $200 cash and hold the postdated check. The lender\ncharges a fee—let’s say $14—as their compensation. The following Thursday, the borrower is expected to pay\noff the advance, and if they do not, the lender can deposit the postdated check. If that check has insufficient",

                    "answer": "The effective annual rate of a credit card that charges 1.5% monthly interest is 19.56%. This is because interest compounds monthly rather than annually, so the effective annual rate is 19.56%, not the intuitive rate of the stated 1.5% times 12 months, or 18%. Our basic compounding formula of (1+i)^n by substitution shows: (1 + 0.015)^12 = 1.1956. To isolate the effective annual rate, we then deduct 1 because our interest calculations are based on the value of $1: 1.1956 - 1 = 0.1956, or 19.56%. Therefore, it falls to the consumer/borrower to understand the true cost of borrowing, especially when larger dollar amounts are involved. If we had been dealing with $10,000 rather than $1,000, the annual difference would be more than $156."

If a stream of payments occurs in\nwhich the amount of the payments changes at any point, the techniques for solving for annuities must be\nmodified. Shortcuts that we have seen in earlier chapters cannot be taken. Fortunately, with tools such as\nfinancial or online calculators and Microsoft Excel, the method can be quite simple.\nThe ability to analyze and understand cash flow is essential. From a personal point of view, assume that you\nhave an opportunity to invest $2,000 every year, beginning next year, to save for a down payment on the\npurchase of your first home seven years from now. In the third year, you also inherit $10,000 and put it all\ntoward this goal. In the fifth year, you receive a large bonus of $3,000 and also dedicate this to your ongoing\ninvestment.\nThe stream of regular payments has been interrupted—which is, of course, good news for you. However, it\ndoes add a new complexity to the math involved in finding values related to time, whether compounding into\nthe future or discounting to the present value. Analysts refer to such a series of payments as a mixed stream.\nIf you make the first payment on the first day of next year and continue to do so on the first day of each\nfollowing year, and if your investment will always be earning 7% interest, how much cash will you have\naccumulated—principal plus earned interest—at the end of the seven years?\nThis is a future value question, but because the stream of payments is mixed, we cannot use annuity formulas\nor approaches and the shortcuts they provide. As noted in previous chapters, when solving a problem\ninvolving the time value of money, a timeline and/or table is helpful. The cash flows described above are\nshown in Table 9.1 . Remember that all money is assumed to be deposited in your investment at the beginning\nof each year. The cumulative cash flows do not yet consider interest.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nCash Invested\n$0.00 $2,000 $2,000 $2,000 $12,000\n$2,000\n$5,000\n$2,000",

What will your year 1 investment be worth at\nthe end of seven years?\nYou need to address the year 2 investment separately at this point because you’ve calculated the year 1\ninvestment and its compounding on its own. Now you need to know what your year 2 investment will be worth\nin the future, but it will only compound for six years. What will it be worth?\nYou can perform the same operation on each of the remaining five invested amounts, remembering that you\ninvest $12,000 at the start of year 4 and $5,000 at the start of year 6, as per the table.

We will begin with a\npersonal example. You win a cash windfall through your state’s lottery. You would like to take a portion of the\nfunds and place them in a fixed investment so that you can draw $17,000 per year starting one year from now\nand continue to do so for the next two years. At the end of year 4, you want to withdraw $17,500, and at the\nend of year 5, you will withdraw the last $18,000 to close the account. When you take your last payment of\n$18,000, your fund will be totally depleted. You will always be earning 6% annually. How much of your cash\nwindfall should you set aside today to accomplish this?\nLet us break down the problem, remembering that we are thinking in reverse from the earlier problems that\ninvolved future values. In this case, we’re bringing future values back in time to find their present values. You\nwill recall that this process is called discounting rather than compounding.\nRegardless of how we solve this, the question remains the same: How much money must we invest today\n(present value) to achieve this? And remember that we will always be earning 6% compounded annually on\nany invested balances.\n9.1 • Timing of Cash Flows\n267\nWe are calculating present values as we did in previous chapters, given a known future value “target,” in order\nto determine how much money you need today to achieve that goal.

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to",

The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate. Rates for floating-rate bonds are typically tied to a benchmark interest rate that exists in the\neconomy.

These bond investors are aware that when\ninterest rates rise, their bond investments will lose value. This is not the case with floating- or variable-rate\nbonds.\nBonds with very low coupon rates are referred to as deep discount bonds. Of course, the bond that has the\ngreatest discount is the zero-coupon bond, with a coupon rate of zero. The smaller the coupon rate, the\ngreater the change in price when interest rates move.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRelationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nReview this video (https://openstax.org/r/relationship-bond-prices) explaining the relationship between\nbond prices and interest rates within financial and capital markets.\n10.2\nBond Valuation\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDetermine the value (price) of a bond.\n•\nUnderstand the characteristics of and differences between discount and premium bonds.\n•\nDraw a timeline indicating bond cash flows.\n•\nDifferentiate between fixed-rate and variable-rate bonds.\n•\nDetermine bond yields.\nPricing a Bond in Steps\nWhy do we want to learn how to price a bond? The answer goes to the heart of finance: the valuation of\nassets. We need to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. What is its value\nto these interested parties? Remember that a bond is a financial asset that a company sells to raise money\nfrom willing investors. Whether you are the company selling the bond or the investor buying the bond, you\nwant to make sure that you are selling or buying at the best available price.\nLet’s begin our pricing examples with the 3M Company corporate bond listed in Table 10.1 above. The table\n288\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninformation tells us that 3M issued a series of corporate bonds that promise to pay coupons annually on\nSeptember 19 and to pay back the principal, or face value, on the maturity date of September 19, 2026.

While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,",

The annual payments continue for 15 years, with the last payment being\nmade on September 19, 2026. At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments\nconstitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.\nThe principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount\nis a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.\nIn Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments. For now, we\nwill jump to the answer and simply use the YTM of 1.24% from the bond data in Table 10.1. Later in the\nchapter, we will develop the concepts behind how an appropriate discount rate is determined.\nFor Step 3, we now apply two equations to the set of future cash flows from the bond. This will then provide us\nwith the present values of these cash flows, or the expected present-day value of the bond.

Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a\nnegative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but",

The coupon rate of a\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders.

Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they",

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call",

However, stocks differ significantly from bonds in how they are issued and managed by\ncompanies, the methodology used to calculate their values in public markets, and how they can generate\nincome and eventual value for individual investors.\nWith common stock, there is no specific promise of how much cash investors will receive or when they will\nreceive it. This differs from bond investments, which are valued entirely on the basis of their guaranteed\ntiming of future cash flows to bondholders.\nThis means that with stocks, there are no maturity dates, face values, or coupon payment guarantees. It also\nmeans that stocks do not promise any specified cash flows in the form of coupons or a face value payment at\nsome point in the future. Instead, stocks (only some, not all) may pay dividends. These dividends are declared\nafter shares of stock have been issued by a company and then purchased by the investing public. Following a\ndividend declaration, the designated per-share amounts are paid to shareholders of record on a specified\ndate, also determined by a company’s board.\nBecause stock investments carry no guarantee of payments to investors, they are far riskier than bonds and\nother forms of fixed-income investments.\nWhile there are many reasons for an investor to choose to purchase common stock, three of the most\nStocks and Stock Valuation\n11\n11 • Why It Matters\n319\ncommon reasons are\n•\nto use stocks as instruments or repositories for maintaining value;\n•\nto accumulate wealth over the term of the stock investment; and\n•\nto earn income through capital gains and dividend payments.\nAs with any financial instrument, common stock purchases offer advantages and disadvantages to investors.\nImportant advantages include the following:\n•\nReturns through dividends and price appreciation of shares can be substantial.\n•",

            "chunk": "Another form of the P/E ratio is known as the forward (or leading) P/E. This uses future earnings projections\nrather than actual trailing amounts. The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the\ndenominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.\nAnalyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when\na company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry\nthat it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as\nwhether a stock that has a ratio of\nis a good buy at its current price or if a stock with a P/E ratio of\nis\ntoo expensive, without performing any relevant comparisons or further analysis.\nAnalysts have many different ways to interpret P/E ratio data. One of the most common interpretations is that\nfirms with high P/E ratios should be growth companies. Also, a high P/E ratio could mean that a stock’s price is\nhigh relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. This could signal a possible undesired downward\nadjustment in market price in the future.\nWe can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be\nstabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to\nearnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential\ninvestment gains through stock price appreciation.\nWhile this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution\nmust always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,\nwhich would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term.

It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share. The book value per share is essentially the tangible assets of the company minus its liabilities divided by the number of outstanding shares of its stock. The P/B ratio is used to give investors an idea of the market's sense of a company's value compared to its book value. A high P/B ratio often indicates that a stock is overvalued and may experience a decline. A low P/B ratio, on the other hand, may indicate that a stock is undervalued and could represent a good buy opportunity. It is important to note that the P/B ratio should not be used as the sole factor in determining the value of a stock, but rather as one of many tools in the valuation process."

Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses. The P/CF ratio is helpful for arriving at a less\ndistorted view of such a company’s value.",

Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their\ncommon stock:\nEV/Revenue (EV/R). Also called EV/Sales, EV/R is a valuation metric used to understand a company’s total\nvaluation compared to its annual sales levels. EV/R can help provide an analyst with an idea of exactly how\nmuch investors pay for every dollar of a company’s sales revenue.\nEV/R is considered a relatively crude metric but can be useful when analyzing companies that have different\nmethods of revenue recognition. P/E ratios, for example, can be significantly affected by changes in the\naccounting policies of companies being evaluated. This is another reason why multiple metrics should be used\nin valuations.\nAdditionally, EV/R is a useful measure for companies that are consuming cash or experiencing financial losses.\nSuch companies may be start-ups or emerging technology firms that have not fully matured and are still in a\ngrowth stage of development.\nEV/EBIT.

This metric divides\nenterprise value by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rental costs (EBITDAR).\nThis multiple is used in businesses that have substantial rental and lease expenses, such as hotel chains\nand airlines.

Using the stock’s price, a required rate of return, and the value\nof the next year’s dividend, investors can determine a stock’s value based on the total present value of future\ndividends.\nThis means that if an investor is buying a stock primarily based on its dividend, the DDM can be a useful tool to\ndetermine exactly how much of the stock’s price is supported by future dividends.

In such a case, the\nstock’s intrinsic value is determined by dividing the annual dividend amount by the required rate of return:\nWhen examined closely, it can be seen that this is the exact same formula that is used to calculate the present\nvalue of a perpetuity, which is\nFor the purpose of using this formula in stock valuation, we can express this as\nwhere PV is equal to the price or value of the stock, D represents the dividend payment, and r represents the\nrequired rate of return.\nThis makes perfect sense because a stock that pays the exact same dividend amount forever is no different\nfrom a perpetuity—a continuous, never-ending annuity—and for this reason, the same formula can be used\nto price preferred stock. The only factor that might alter the value of a stock based on the zero-growth model\nwould be a change in the required rate of return due to fluctuations in perceived risk levels.\n326\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nExample:\nWhat is the intrinsic value of a stock that pays $2.00 in dividends every year if the required rate of return on\nsimilar investments in the market is 6%?\nSolution:\nWe can apply the zero growth DDM formula to get\nWhile this model is relatively easy to understand and to calculate, it has one significant flaw: it is highly unlikely",

As companies change and grow, dividend policies will change, and it naturally follows that the\npayout of dividends will also change. This is why it is important to become familiar with other DDMs that may\nbe more practical in their use.\nConstant Growth Dividend Discount Model\nAs indicated by its name, the constant growth DDM assumes that a stock’s dividend payments will grow at a\nfixed annual percentage that will remain the same throughout the period of time they are held by an investor.\nWhile the constant growth DDM may be more realistic than the zero growth DDM in allowing for dividend\ngrowth, it assumes that dividends grow by the same specific percentage each year. This is also an unrealistic\nassumption that can present problems when attempting to evaluate companies such as Amazon, Facebook,\nGoogle, or other organizations that do not pay dividends. Constant growth models are most often used to\nvalue mature companies whose dividend payments have steadily increased over a significant period of time.\nWhen applied, the constant growth DDM will generate the present value of an infinite stream of dividends that\nare growing at a constant rate.\nThe constant growth DDM formula is\nwhere D0 is the value of the dividend received this year, D1 is the value of the dividend to be received next\nyear, g is the growth rate of the dividend, and r is the required rate of return.\nAs can be seen above, after simplification, the constant growth DDM formula becomes the Gordon growth\nmodel formula and works in the same way.

Also,\nbecause the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or\nsubjectivity.

They may not want to manipulate dividend payments, as this can\ndirectly lead to stock price volatility. Rather, they may manipulate dividend payments in the interest of buoying\nup their stock price.\nTo further illustrate limitations of DDMs, let’s examine the Concepts in Practice case.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nLimitations of DDMs\nA major limitation of the dividend discount model is that it cannot be used to value companies that do not\npay dividends. This is becoming a growing trend, particularly for young high-tech companies. Warren\nBuffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has stated that companies are usually better off if they take their\nexcess funds and reinvest them into infrastructure, evolving technologies, and other profitable ventures.\nThe payment of dividends to shareholders is “almost a last resort for corporate management,”1 says\nBuffett, and cash balances should be invested in “projects to become more efficient, expand territorially,\nextend and improve product lines or . . . otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from\nits competitors.”2 Berkshire follows this practice of reinvesting cash rather than paying dividends, as do",

If we assume that we will sell the stock at some point in the future,\nhowever, can we use this formula to estimate the value of a stock held for a finite period of time?

Let’s assume that the new owner also wants a 17% return and that the dividend\ngrowth rate will remain at 13.04%. We calculate the dividend in 10 years by taking the current growth rate plus\none raised to the tenth power times the current dividend:\nWe then use the dividend growth model with infinite horizon to determine the price in 10 years as follows:\nYour price for the stock today—given that you will receive the growing dividend stream for 10 years and sell\nfor $258.10 in 10 years, and also given that you want a 17% return over the 10 years—is as shown below:\nWhy did you get the same price of $60.23 for your stock with both the infinite growth model and the finite\nmodel? The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model\nwith a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales\nof the stock.\nAlthough this point may be subtle, what we have just shown is that a stock’s price is the present value of its\nfuture dividend stream.

However, problems can arise\nwhen using these models because the timing and amounts of future cash flows may be difficult to predict.\n340\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n11.3\nDiscounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how the DCF model differs from DDMs.\n•\nApply the DCF model.\n•\nExplain the advantages and disadvantages of the DCF model.\nWhen investors buy stock, they do so in order to receive cash inflows at different points in time in the future.\nThese inflows come in the form of cash dividends (provided the stock does indeed pay dividends, because not\nall do) and also in the form of the final cash inflow that will occur when the investor decides to sell the stock.\nThe investor hopes that the final sale price of the stock will be higher than the purchase price, resulting in a\ncapital gain. The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young",

We arrive at this amount by applying the discount rate of 8% for a one-year period to determine\nthe present value.\nIn subsequent years, Mayweather’s cash flow will be increasing by 3%. These future cash flows also must be\ndiscounted back to present values at an 8% rate, so the discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years\nwill be as follows:\nOur earlier assumption that the terminal value will be 2.5 times the value in the sixth year gives us a total\nterminal cash flow (TCF) of\n, or $3,652,697. Now, if we take all these future discounted cash\nflows and add them together, we arrive at a grand total of $13,554,477. So, based on our DCF model analysis,\nthe total value of Mayweather Inc. is just over $13.5 million.\nAt this point, we have the estimated value of the entire company, but we need to work this down to the level of\nper-share value of common stock.\nLet’s say that Mayweather is currently trading at $12 per share, and it has 1,000,000 common shares\noutstanding. This tells us that the market capitalization of the company is\n, or $12 million,\nand that a $12 share price may be considered relatively low. The reason for this is that based on our DCF\nmodel analysis, investors would theoretically be willing to pay $13,554,477 divided by 1,000,000 shares, or\n$13.55 per share, for Mayweather. The overall conclusion would be that at $12.00 per share, Mayweather\ncommon stock would be a good buy at the present time.

The only time a company would pay this par value to the\nshareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\n11.4 • Preferred Stock\n343\nFor example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future. It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant\ncash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of\nperpetuity.\nIt is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another\nform of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred\nstock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.\nDetermining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock\nWe can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the\nfollowing example. Oh-Well Heath Services Inc. has issued preferred stock that has a par value of $1,000 and\npays an annual dividend rate of 5%. If the market considers the risk of Oh-Well to warrant a 10% discount rate,\nwhat would be a fair market price for Oh-Well preferred stock?",

When investors buy this ETF, they purchase a small bundle of Treasury\nnotes that they can buy or sell, just as if they owned an individual share of stock. ETFs are a convenient way for\ninvestors to own broad portfolios of securities while still being able to trade the whole group in a single\ntransaction if they choose.\n2\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York. “Effective Federal Funds Rate.” Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\n356\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.2 Daily Trading Volume for US Treasury Notes and Bonds (data source: treasurydirect.gov)",

T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of\n20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8\ntrillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.\nIn 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument, Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once\nper month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the\nsecurity and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts\nmonthly in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of\nthe principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a\ntotal outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury\nborrowing we have discussed.3\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (munis). Local\nborrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,\nmunis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on\nthe perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-\nfree. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\nThere are two primary types of municipal bonds: revenue bonds and general obligation (GO) bonds.

Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\ncost of borrowing for the firm.

So which is the riskier asset?”14 Siegel brings up a valid point\nabout inflation. Returns adjusted for changes in prices provide a better measure of value or wealth. Baseball\npundit Sam Ewing noted, “Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten-dollar haircut you used to get\nfor five dollars when you had hair.”15 If what you have earned on your investments fails to keep up with\nchanging prices, you may have a larger portfolio with less purchasing power.\nExpected versus Actual Inflation\nInflation occurs when things cost more and your money buys less today than it did yesterday. It is\nunderstandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the\nprimary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.\nHowever, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others\nat the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical\nevidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that\nmatch the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are\nwilling to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation\nexceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the\nloan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate. Lenders, however, receive those\ninflation-impacted dollars and are harmed due to their unexpected decrease in purchasing power.\nDeflation, or falling prices, is associated with economic recessions or even depressions and is thought to be an\neven more serious problem than inflation. Generally, policy makers tend to support moderate inflation, being\ncareful to stay away from zero or negative price changes.\n14\nJeremy J. Siegel.

For example, if you have $100 in your pocket today, it will only be able to buy you $80 worth of goods tomorrow. This is because the prices of goods and services increase over time, and your money loses its value as a result. Inflation also makes it more difficult for businesses to plan and invest, as they cannot be sure of what their costs will be in the future. Additionally, high inflation can lead to economic instability, as people may hoard their money rather than spending it, which can cause a slowdown in economic activity. Overall, inflation is bad for individuals, businesses, and the economy as a whole."

On the positive side, inflation can help stimulate economic growth by encouraging people to spend their money rather than saving it. This is because when prices are rising, people may feel more inclined to buy goods and services before their prices increase even further. Additionally, inflation can help reduce unemployment by making it easier for businesses to raise wages and increase hiring. On the negative side, inflation can also lead to economic instability and uncertainty, as people may be hesitant to make long-term investments or take on debt if they are unsure of what the future holds. Additionally, high inflation can lead to a decline in the value of savings and investments, as the purchasing power of money decreases. Overall, the impact of inflation on the economy is complex and depends on a variety of factors, including the rate of inflation, the underlying causes of inflation, and the policies put in place by governments and central banks to manage it."

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average. For the selected items presented\nhere, only the average price for used cars and trucks rose at a rate significantly lower than the average rate of\ninflation.\nYear\n1980 2000 2020 Annual Change\nCollege tuition and fees\n70.8 331.9 877.3\n6.49%\nRent\n80.9 183.9 341.5\n3.67%\nUsed cars and trucks\n62.3 155.8 144.2\n2.12%\nGround beef\n104.6 125.2 296.2\n2.64%\nButter\n89.4 135.9 248.7\n2.59%\nCPI (1982 to 1984 = 100)\n82.4 172.2 258.8\n2.90%\nTable 12.3 Changing Consumer Price Levels—Selected Goods (source:\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index)\nUsing Graphs and Charts to Plot Inflation Behavior\nThe CPI is a measure of how prices have changed for a basket of goods across the United States.

After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, Yellen later\nattended Yale University and was the only woman in her 1971 PhD graduating class in economics. Men have\nlong dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.\nMotivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen\nrealized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary\npeople. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record. During her four-year tenure, the rate of unemployment\ndecreased by more than 2.5%, and employment increased in every month of her term. This is the first and\nonly time in the history of the Federal Reserve that the board chair has overseen continuous increases in\n12.2 • Historical Picture of Inflation\n365\nemployment over their entire tenure.",

In fact, T-bonds often\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,\nbond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments",

When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If\nyou’re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.”\nBuffett has begun the process to give away most of his fortune, but he has left this pearl of wisdom for his\nown children: “A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do\nnothing.”\n(Sources: Joshua Kennon. “How Warren Buffett Became One of the Wealthiest People in America.” The\nBalance.

The Federal Reserve System's main tool for achieving this is monetary policy, which consists of three tools: the discount rate, the reserve requirement, and open market operations. The discount rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges banks to borrow money from it. The reserve requirement is the amount of money that banks must keep on hand to meet customer withdrawals. Open market operations are the purchase and sale of government securities by the Federal Reserve to control the money supply. The Federal Reserve System also has the power to regulate banks and other financial institutions. The Federal Reserve System can use these tools to prevent bank runs by increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, and increasing the reserve requirement. This would make it easier for banks to meet customer withdrawals and prevent them from failing."

The figure shows that growth stocks have outperformed value stocks in the long run, but there have been many periods where value stocks have outperformed growth stocks. This means that growth investors have been taking on more risk than value investors without necessarily achieving higher returns.

For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000.

It is small when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little\nvariation or spread. It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\nvariation.\nSuppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The average stock\nprice for both stocks is $5. For Stock A, the standard deviation of the stock price is 2, whereas the standard\ndeviation for Stock B is 4. Because Stock B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more\nvariation in the stock price for Stock B than in the price for Stock A.\nThere are two different formulas for calculating standard deviation. Which formula to use depends on whether\nthe data represents a sample or a population. The notation s is used to represent the sample standard\ndeviation, and the notation\nis used to represent the population standard deviation. In the formulas shown\nbelow, x̄ is the sample mean,\nis the population mean, n is the sample size, and N is the population size.\nFormula for the sample standard deviation:\nFormula for the population standard deviation:\nVariance\nVariance also provides a measure of the spread of data values. The variance of a data set measures the extent\nto which each data value differs from the mean. The more the individual data values differ from the mean, the\nlarger the variance. Both the standard deviation and the variance provide similar information.\nIn a finance application, variance can be used to determine the volatility of an investment and therefore to\nhelp guide financial decisions. For example, a more cautious investor might opt for investments with low\nvolatility.\nSimilar to standard deviation, the formula used to calculate variance also depends on whether the data is\ncollected from a sample or a population. The notation\nis used to represent the sample variance, and the\nnotation σ2 is used to represent the population variance.\nFormula for the sample variance:\nFormula for the population variance:\nThis is the method to calculate standard deviation and variance for a sample:\n1.\nFirst, find the mean\nof the data set by adding the data values and dividing the sum by the number of\ndata values.\n2.\nSet up a table with three columns, and in the first column, list the data values in the data set.\n3.\nFor each row, subtract the mean from the data value\n, and enter the difference in the second\n386",

To calculate these statistical results in Excel, enter the data values in a column.\nLet’s assume the data values are placed in cells A2 through A11. In any cell, type the Excel command\n=AVERAGE(A2:A11) and press enter. Excel will calculate the arithmetic mean in this cell. Then, in any other cell,\ntype the Excel command =STDEV.S(A2:A11) and press enter. Excel will calculate the sample standard deviation\nin this cell. Figure 13.2 shows the mean and standard deviation for the 10 ages.\nFigure 13.2 Mean and Standard Deviation in Excel.\nRelationship between Standard Deviation and Variance\nIn the formulas shown above for variance and standard deviation, notice that the variance is the square of the\nstandard deviation, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nOnce you have calculated one of these values, you can directly calculate the other value. For example, if you\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.\nIn the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by\ncalculating the square root of the variance. For example, if the variance of a data set is known to be 31.36, then\nthe standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of 31.36, which is 5.6.\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n389\nOne disadvantage of using the variance is that the variance is measured in square units, which are different\nfrom the units in the data set. For example, if the data set consists of ages measured in years, then the\nvariance would be measured in years squared, which can be confusing. The standard deviation is measured in\nthe same units as the original data set, and thus the standard deviation is used more commonly than the\nvariance to measure the spread of a data set.\n13.3\nMeasures of Position\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate z-scores for a measurement.\n•\nDefine and calculate quartiles and percentiles for a data set.\n•\nUse quartiles as a method to detect outliers in a data set.\nz-Scores",

The mean is the same\nas the median, which is the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about\n. As the notation\nindicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. Because the area\nunder the curve must equal 1, a change in the standard deviation,\n, causes a change in the shape of the\nnormal curve; the curve becomes fatter and wider or skinnier and taller depending on\n. A change in\ncauses\nthe graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability\ndistributions.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the normal distribution, we find specific areas under the normal\ncurve, and this is further discussed in Apply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts. For example,\nsuppose that at a financial consulting company, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with a standard\ndeviation of $7,500. A normal curve can be drawn to represent this scenario, in which the mean of $60,000\nwould be plotted on the horizontal axis, corresponding to the peak of the curve. Then, to find the probability\nthat an employee earns more than $75,000, you would calculate the area under the normal curve to the right\nof the data value $75,000.\nExcel uses the following command to find the area under the normal curve to the left of a specified value:\n=NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE)\nFor example, at the financial consulting company mentioned above, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with\na standard deviation of $7,500. To find the probability that a random employee’s salary is less than $55,000\nusing Excel, this is the command you would use:\n=NORM.DIST(55000, 60000, 7500, TRUE)\nResult: 0.25249\nThus, there is a probability of about 25% that a random employee has a salary less than $55,000.\nExponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.

One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb\nis to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more.\nA histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The\nhorizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The\nvertical axis is labeled either Frequency or Relative Frequency (or Percent Frequency or Probability). The graph\nwill have the same shape regardless of the label on the vertical axis. A histogram, like a stem-and-leaf plot, can\ngive you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data.\nThe relative frequency is equal to the frequency of an observed data value divided by the total number of data\nvalues in the sample. Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times a solution occurs. Relative\nfrequency is calculated using the formula\nwhere f = frequency, n = the total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and RF =\nrelative frequency.\nTo construct a histogram, first decide how many bars or intervals, also called classes, will represent the data.\nMany histograms consist of 5 to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose\na starting point for the first interval that is less than the smallest data value. A convenient starting point is a\nlower value carried out to one more decimal place than the value with the most decimal places. For example, if",

One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a discrete value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one (grouped bar graphs), and others show the bars standing alone (stacked bar graphs). Typically, each bar represents a percentage (relative to all the data) or absolute value (relative to a scale)."

                    "answer": "A histogram is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights. Histograms are used to summarize discrete or continuous data. Histogram bars are similar to bars in a vertical bar graph. The area of each histogram bar is proportional to the data it represents. Instead of displaying raw data, histograms group the data into ranges. The ranges are called bins. The bins are similar to intervals in a frequency table. The bins are displayed on the horizontal axis, and the frequency distribution is displayed on the vertical axis. Histograms are often used to illustrate the distribution of data. Histograms are also used to compare data sets in scientific research."

The largest value is 74, and\n, so 74.05 is the ending value.\nNext, calculate the width of each bar or class interval. To calculate this width, subtract the starting point from\nthe ending value and divide the result by the number of bars (you must choose the number of bars you\ndesire). Suppose you choose eight bars. The interval width is calculated as follows:\nWe will round up to 2 and make each bar or class interval 2 units wide. Rounding up to 2 is one way to prevent\na value from falling on a boundary. Rounding to the next number is often necessary, even if it goes against the\nstandard rules of rounding. For this example, using 1.76 as the width would also work. A guideline that is\nfollowed by some for the width of a bar or class interval is to take the square root of the number of data values\nand then round to the nearest whole number if necessary. For example, if there are 150 data values, take the\nsquare root of 150 and round to 12 bars or intervals. The boundaries are as follows:\nThe data values 60 through 61.5 are in the interval 59.95–61.95. The data values of 63.5 are in the interval\n61.95–63.95. The data values of 64 and 64.5 are in the interval 63.95–65.95. The data values 66 through 67.5 are\nin the interval 65.95–67.95. The data values 68 through 69.5 are in the interval 67.95–69.95. The data values 70\nthrough 71 are in the interval 69.95–71.95. The data values 72 through 73.5 are in the interval 71.95–73.95. The\ndata value 74 is in the interval 73.95–75.95.

There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector. The following R command will generate a vector called salaries that contains the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nThis vector salaries can then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as\nshown:\n> mean(salaries)\n[1] 64250\n> median(salaries)\n[1] 62500\n> min(salaries)\n[1] 40000\n> max(salaries)\n[1] 92000\n13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool\n407\nAnother option for generating a vector in R is to use the seq function, which will automatically generate a\nsequence of numbers.

The\nterms mean and average are often used interchangeably. To calculate the mean for a set of numbers, add the\nnumbers together and then divide the sum by the number of data values. The geometric mean redistributes\nnot the sum of the values but the product by multiplying all of the individual values and then redistributing\nthem in equal portions such that the total product remains the same. To calculate the median for a set of\nnumbers, order the data from smallest to largest and identify the middle data value in the ordered data set.\n13.2 Measures of Spread\nThe standard deviation and variance are measures of the spread of a data set. The standard deviation is small\nwhen the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard\ndeviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. The\nformula used to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the data represents a sample or a\npopulation, as the formulas for the sample standard deviation and the population standard deviation are\nslightly different.\n13.3 Measures of Position\nSeveral measures are used to indicate the position of a data value in a data set. One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean.

The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest.

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year. When we are looking at the historical\ndescription of the distribution of returns and want to predict what to expect in a particular year, the arithmetic\naverage is the relevant calculation.\nMeasuring Risk\nAlthough the arithmetic average return for Delta Airlines (DAL) for 2011–2020 was 22.4%, there is not a year in\nwhich the return was exactly 22.4%. In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.\nLooking at the yearly returns in Table 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL.

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

Geopolitical events, major storms, and pandemics can also impact the\nentire market. Investors in stocks cannot avoid this type of risk. This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that\ninvestors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.\nIn addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,4 the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as\nthe number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration in this\nsubsequent article by Statman (https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman) for context). Increasing the size\nof the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio\nincreases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How\nmany stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all\nfinancial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification\nthan a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients. A portfolio that consists of American Airlines,\nSpirit Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Jet Blue, along with a few other stocks, is\nnot very diversified because of the heavy concentration in the airline industry. The term diversified portfolio is\na relative concept, but the average investor can create a reasonably diversified portfolio with approximately a\ndozen stocks.\n15.3\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine risk premium.\n•\nExplain the concept of beta.\n•\nCompute the required return of a security using the CAPM.\nRisk-Free Rate\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a financial theory based on the idea that investors who are willing\nto hold stocks that have higher systematic risk should be rewarded more for taking on this market risk. The\nCAPM focuses on systematic risk, rather than a stock’s individual risk, because firm-specific risk can be\neliminated through diversification.",

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%.

The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio.

A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the\nportfolio returns can also be calculated easily. By comparing the returns of a stock with the returns of the\noverall market using Excel charting tools, the beta for a stock, which measures systematic risk, can be\ndetermined.\nKey Terms\narithmetic average return",

It is typically estimated using the return on short-term government bonds, such as US Treasury bills. The risk-free rate is an important concept in finance because it is used to calculate the expected return of an investment. The expected return of an investment is the return that an investor expects to earn, based on the risk-free rate and the risk premium.

Customers have been inquiring about customizing items such as baseball caps and equipment\nbags with logos and other designs. Sam’s is considering purchasing an embroidery machine so that it can\nprovide these customized items in-house. The machine will cost $16,000. Purchasing the embroidery machine\nwould be an investment in a fixed asset. If it purchases the machine, Sam’s will be able to charge customers\nfor customization.\nHow Companies Think about Investing\n16\n16 • Why It Matters\n479\nThe managers think that selling customized items will allow the company to increase its cash flow by $2,000\nnext year. They predict that as customers become more aware of this service, the ability to customize products\nin-house will increase the company’s cash flow by $4,000 the following year. The managers expect the\nmachine will be used for five years, with the embroidery products increasing cash flows by $5,000 during each\nof the last three years the machine is used. Should Sam’s Sporting Goods invest in the embroidery machine?\nIn this chapter, we consider the main capital budgeting techniques Sam’s and other companies can use to\nevaluate these types of decisions.\n16.1\nPayback Period Method\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine payback period.\n•\nCalculate payback period.\n•\nList the advantages and disadvantages of using the payback period method.\nThe payback period method provides a simple calculation that the managers at Sam’s Sporting Goods can use\nto evaluate whether to invest in the embroidery machine. The payback period calculation focuses on how\nlong it will take for a company to make enough free cash flow from the investment to recover the initial cost of\nthe investment.\nPayback Period Calculation\nIn order to purchase the embroidery machine, Sam’s Sporting Goods must spend $16,000. During the first\nyear, Sam’s expects to see a $2,000 benefit from purchasing the machine, but this means that after one year,\nthe company will have spent $14,000 more than it has made from the project. During the second year that it\nuses the machine, Sam’s expects that its cash inflow will be $4,000 greater than it would have been if it had not\nhad the machine. Thus, after two years, the company will have spent $10,000 more than it has benefited from\nthe machine.

The payback period method breaks the important finance\nrule of not adding or comparing cash flows that occur in different time periods.\nA second disadvantage of using the payback period method is that there is not a clearly defined acceptance or\nrejection criterion. When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length of time in which a\nproject must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods\nthan the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s were to set a payback period of four\nyears, Project A would be accepted, but Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and so would\nbe rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years would be arbitrary; it is not grounded in any\nfinancial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of three, four, five, or\nany other number of years as its criterion for accepting projects.\nA third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all\nhave payback periods of five years. However, Projects B and C end after year 5, while Project D has a large cash\nflow that occurs in year 6, which is excluded from the analysis. The payback method is shortsighted in that it\nfavors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash\nflows after the arbitrary payback time criterion.\nFourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful the planning and analysis,\na business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier than others, with less\ncertain cash flows, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash\nflows.\n16.1 • Payback Period Method\n481\n16.2\nNet Present Value (NPV) Method\nLearning Outcomes",

This website on calculating the NPV on an MBA degree\n(https://openstax.org/r/calculating-the-NPV) lets you apply this concept in an educational setting. The\ninitial cost of the MBA includes both the dollars spent on tuition and the wages that a full-time student\ncould have earned if they were not in school. Why is it appropriate to include these forgone wages in the\ncalculation? What adjustments would students need to make to this analysis if they wanted to consider\nattending a part-time MBA program that allowed them to continue working while completing the program?\nNPV Profile\nThe NPV of a project depends on the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to\ntranslate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the\nembroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash\nflows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.\nTheoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In\nreality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an\napproximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall\nconclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and\nallows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.\nTo construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery\nmachine project using each of those discount rates. Table 16.6 below shows the NPV for several discount rates.\nNotice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate",

The cash flow from these projects will be great enough to cover the cost of attracting money\nfrom investors in addition to the other costs of the project. A company should reject any project that has an\nIRR less than the company’s cost of attracting funds; the cash flows from such a project are not enough to\ncompensate the investors for the use of their funds.\nCalculating IRR without a financial calculator is an arduous, time-consuming process that requires trial and\nerror to find the discount rate that makes NPV exactly equal zero.

The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from\nbest to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.\nDiscounted Payback Period\nThe payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the\nfact that it ignores the time value of money. The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\ndetermine the payback period.\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project.

This approach involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\n•\nThe NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\n•\nThe NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\nproject.\n•\nFor the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.\n•\nFor the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\nformula.\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that",

The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\nestimate of what it expects.\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\nby the end of April.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReducing Capital Spending\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is the time it takes the company to recoup its\ninitial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\nNPV is negative.\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\n16.4 Alternative Methods\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered.

If a firm will produce shirts, for\nexample, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to\nstore its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These\nitems the company needs to conduct its operations are assets. They appear on the left-hand side of the\nbalance sheet.\nThe company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets\nappear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent its capital.\nThere are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).\nFigure 17.2 is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet\nmust be\n. Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling\nownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders). The debt that a firm uses is\noften referred to as financial leverage. The relative proportions of debt and equity that a firm uses in\nfinancing its assets is referred to as its capital structure.\nFigure 17.2 Basic Balance Sheet for Company with Debt, Preferred Stock, and Common Equity in Capital Structure\nAttracting Capital\nWhen a company raises money from investors, those investors forgo the opportunity to invest that money\nelsewhere.

In economics terms, there is an opportunity cost to those who buy a company’s bonds or stock.\nSuppose, for example, that you have $5,000, and you purchase Tesla stock. You could have purchased Apple\nstock or Disney stock instead. There were many other options, but once you chose Tesla stock, you no longer\nhad the money available for the other options. You would only purchase Tesla stock if you thought that you\nwould receive a return as large as you would have for the same level of risk on the other investments.\nFrom Tesla’s perspective, this means that the company can only attract your capital if it offers an expected\nreturn high enough for you to choose it as the company that will use your money. Providing a return equal to\nwhat potential investors could expect to earn elsewhere for a similar risk is the cost a company bears in\nexchange for obtaining funds from investors. Just as a firm must consider the costs of electricity, raw\nmaterials, and wages when it calculates the costs of doing business, it must also consider the cost of attracting\ncapital so that it can purchase its assets.\nWeights in the Capital Structure\nMost companies have multiple sources of capital. The firm’s overall cost of capital is a weighted average of its\n508\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndebt and equity costs of capital. The average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted by the\nfractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity, is known as the weighted average cost of\ncapital (WACC).\nThe weights in the WACC are the proportions of debt and equity used in the firm’s capital structure. If, for\nexample, a company is financed 25% by debt and 75% by equity, the weights in the WACC would be 25% on the\ndebt cost of capital and 75% on the equity cost of capital. The balance sheet of the company would look like\nFigure 17.3.\nThese weights can be derived from the right-hand side of a market-value-based balance sheet. Recall that\naccounting-based book values listed on traditional financial statements reflect historical costs. The market-\nvalue balance sheet is similar to the accounting balance sheet, but all values are current market values.\nFigure 17.3 Balance Sheet of Company with Capital Structure of 25% Debt and 75% Equity\nJust as the accounting balance sheet must balance, the market-value balance sheet must balance:",

However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data.

The lack of any debt in the capital structure means the firm\nwould have no financial leverage. The equity in a firm that has no financial leverage is called unlevered\nequity.\nThe Levered Firm\nNext, consider borrowing some of the money that you will need to start this T-shirt business. Although the\ncash flows from the business are uncertain, suppose you are certain that the business will generate at least\n$18,000. (Perhaps you have a guaranteed order from the cycling competition sponsors.) If you borrowed\n$17,000 at the risk-free interest rate of 4%, you would owe\nto the lenders at the\nend of the year. Because you are certain that you will generate at least $18,000 in cash, which is greater than\n$17,680, you can borrow the $17,000 without any risk of defaulting.\nThe $17,000 will not be enough to pay for all the start-up costs. You will also need to raise some capital by\nselling equity. Because your firm will have some debt, or financial leverage, the equity that you raise will be\nknown as levered equity. The equity holders expect the firm to generate $52,000 in cash flows. Debt holders\nmust be paid before equity holders, so this will leave\nfor the shareholders.\nThe expected future cash flows generated by the business are determined by the productivity of its assets, not\nthe manner in which those assets are financed. It is the present value of these expected future cash flows that\ndetermines the firm’s value.

They began by considering what would occur in a perfectly competitive\nmarket. One of the assumptions of this perfect capital market is that there are no taxes. The idea that the\nmarket value of the unlevered and levered firm is the same in perfect capital markets is known in the field\nof finance as MM Proposition I.\nVisit Milken Institute’s 5-Minute Finance site to explore more about Modigliani and Miller’s contributions\n(https://openstax.org/r/Modigliani) to the understanding of capital structure.\nThe value of your T-shirt business remains at $45,614. You can calculate the value of the levered equity as\nNow, shareholders are willing to pay $28,614 for ownership in this company. They expect to get $34,320 in one\nyear in return for purchasing this equity. What discount rate does this imply?\n17.4 • Capital Structure Choices\n517\nNotice that the expected return to shareholders has risen from 14% for the unlevered firm to 19.94% for the\nlevered firm. Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.\nWhy does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders. Equity holders\nare residual claimants; they will only receive payment if there is money left over after the debt holders are fully\npaid. The business is risky. You are certain that the company will have cash flow of at least $18,000 at the end\nof the year and that $17,680 will be paid to the debt holders. Therefore, if the company performs poorly\n(perhaps bad weather results in the cancellation of much of the cycling competition) and the cash flows fall\nway below what you are expecting, there may be only several hundred dollars left for the shareholders.\nWhen the firm was unlevered, if the cash flow at the end of the year was only $18,000, the shareholders would\nreceive $18,000. When leverage is used, the same cash flow would result in shareholders receiving only $320.\nThe risk to the shareholders increases as leverage is used; thus, the risk premium that shareholders require",

When leverage is used, the same cash flow would result in shareholders receiving only $320.\nThe risk to the shareholders increases as leverage is used; thus, the risk premium that shareholders require\nalso increases as leverage is used.\nLeverage and the WACC\nWhat happens to the WACC as leverage is used? To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\nequity in the capital structure:\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases.

As debt increases, the interest tax shield becomes less important, and the increased risk of default becomes more important. Eventually, the interest tax shield is outweighed by the increased risk of default, and the company should reduce its leverage. This point is called the optimal capital structure. The optimal capital structure is the point at which the interest tax shield is maximized and the increased risk of default is minimized. This point is different for each company.

For firms that have higher costs of financing distress, this point will be\nreached sooner. Thus, firms that face higher costs of financial distress have a lower optimal level of leverage\nthan firms that face lower costs of financial distress.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNetflix\nNetflix has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 25 years. Starting as a DVD rental company, Netflix\nquickly shifted its model to content streaming. In recent years, the company has become a major producer\nof content, and it is currently the largest media/entertainment company by market capitalization. It is\nexpensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content. Netflix has funded much of its content through\nselling debt.\nYou can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answers the\ncompany provides to common investor questions (https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can\nalso find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s\nbalance sheet has increased over the past few years.\nFigure 17.4 demonstrates how the value of a levered firm varies with the level of debt financing used. Vu is the\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\ninterest and taxes (EBIT). Once the interest expense equals EBIT, the firm will have no taxable income. There is\nno tax benefit from paying more interest after that point.\n17.5 • Optimal Capital Structure\n521\nFigure 17.4 Maximum Value of a Levered Firm\nAs the firm increases debt and increases the value of the tax benefit of debt, it also increases the probability of\nfacing financial distress.

The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to\ndetermine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target. Reducing debt and increasing equity would require transaction costs that might be quite\nsignificant.\nTable 17.7 shows the average WACC for some common industries. The calculations are based on corporate\ninformation at the end of December 2020. A risk-free rate of 3% and a market-risk premium of 5% are assumed\nin the calculations. You can see that the capital structure used by firms varies widely by industry. Companies in\nthe online retail industry are financed almost entirely through equity capital; on average, less than 7% of the\ncapital comes from debt for those companies. On the other hand, companies in the rubber and tires industry\ntend to use a heavy amount of debt in their capital structure. With a debt weight of 63.62%, almost two-thirds\nof the capital for these companies comes from debt.\nIndustry Name\nEquity Weight Debt Weight Beta Cost of Equity Tax Rate\nAfter-Tax\nCost of Debt WACC\nRetail (online)\n93.33%\n6.67% 1.16\n8.82%\n2.93%\n2.19% 8.38%\nComputers/peripherals\n91.45%\n8.55% 1.18\n8.92%\n3.71%\n1.88% 8.32%\nHousehold products\n87.07%\n12.93% 0.73\n6.65%\n5.06%\n2.19% 6.07%",

The company must finance 100% of its assets.\nIssuing New Common Stock\nAn existing firm can acquire equity capital to expand its assets in two ways: the retention of earnings or the\nsale of new shares of stock. Thus far in the chapter, the cost of equity capital calculations have assumed that\nthe earnings were being retained for equity capital financing.\nThe net income that is left after all expenses are paid is the residual income that belongs to the shareholders.\nInstead of receiving a fixed payment for letting the firm use their capital (like bondholders who receive fixed\ninterest payments), the reward to shareholders for letting the company use their capital varies from year to\nyear. In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth. Shareholders are willing to allow the company to retain these\nearnings because they expect that the money will be used to fund profitable projects, leading to an even larger\nreward for shareholders in future years.\nAlthough managers do not need to actively solicit the funds that are retained to fund the business, managers\ncannot view these funds as costless. The shareholders will require a return on those funds to entice them to\nallow the company to delay paying the dollars to them immediately in terms of a dividend.\nSuppose a company has $1 million in net income one year. If it pays $250,000 in dividends and retains\n$750,000, then it can finance $750,000 more in assets. If the company has a capital structure of 25% debt and\n75% equity and wants to maintain that capital structure, it must increase its debt by $250,000 to balance the\nincrease in equity.

It might seem as if the firm\ncould lower its weighted average cost of capital by issuing convertible debt rather than nonconvertible debt.\nHowever, this is not the case. Remember that holders of convertible bonds choose whether they would prefer\nto convert the bond and become a stockholder or receive the face value of the bond at maturity.\nIf a bond has a face value of $1,000, the convertible bond holders will consider whether the stock they can\nconvert to is worth more than $1,000. Only when the price of the stock has increased enough that the value of\nthe stock received is more than $1,000 will the bondholders convert. However, this means that instead of\npaying $1,000, the firm is paying the bondholder in stock worth more than $1,000. In essence, the firm (and\nthe current shareholders) would be selling an equity position in the company for less than the market price of",

As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.\n17.5 Optimal Capital Structure\nA company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases. Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt\nequals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.\n17.6 Alternative Sources of Funds\nPreferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over\ncommon stockholders in the order of claimants. A fixed dividend is paid to preferred shareholders and must\nbe paid before common shareholders receive dividends. Equity capital can be raised through either retaining\nearnings or selling new shares of stock. Significant flotation costs are associated with issuing new shares of\nstock, making it the most expensive source of financing.

The statement of\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n537\ncash flows is broken down into three key categories: operating, investing, and financing. This allows users to\nclearly see what elements of the business are generating or using cash. In Figure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake\nhad cash flow from operating activities of $53,600, cash used for investing activities of ($18,600), and cash\nused for financing activities of ($15,000).\nFigure 18.4 Statement of Cash Flows\nAnother key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is\nnecessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance.

Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis. To prepare a common-size analysis of the\nbalance sheet, every item on the statement must be expressed as a percentage of total assets. Seeing each\nitem as a percentage—that is, seeing its relationship to total assets—is also helpful for assessing historical\nstatements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.\nFor example, in Figure 18.5, you can see that Clear Lake’s current assets represented 80% of its total assets in\nboth the current and prior years.\nFigure 18.5 Common-Size Balance Sheet\nIncome Statement Analysis\nLike balance sheet analysis, income statement analysis is also quite helpful in preparing for the forecasting\nprocess. In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other\ngains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. the bottom line. Each segment of the income\nstatement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to",

This method relies on sales data, further highlighting why accuracy in forecasting\nsales is crucial.\nSales as the Driver\nA significant portion of a business’s costs are driven by how much it sells. Thus, the sales forecast is the\nnecessary first step in preparing a financial forecast. Common costs driven by sales include direct product\ncosts, direct labor costs, and other key variable costs (i.e., costs that vary proportionately to sales), such as\nsales commissions.\nLooking to the Past\nForecasting sales is not always an easy task, as no one knows the future. We can, however, use the information\nwe do have to forecast future sales with the greatest accuracy possible. Most firms start by looking at the past.\nA firm may look at past sales from a variety of prior periods. It’s common to look at the past 12 months to\nestimate the coming 12 months. Looking at 12 consecutive months helps identify seasonality of sales trends,\nwhat time of year sales tend to drop off and when they increase, possible sales spikes that might reoccur, and\nany other trends that tend to appear over a 12-month period. In Figure 18.7, we see Clear Lake’s sales by\nmonth for the past 12 months.\nPast data is often used in conjunction with probabilities and weighted average calculations derived from\nprobabilities. Though used in several areas of forecasting, this approach is particularly common in drafting the\nsales forecast. Using multiple scenarios and the probability of each scenario occurring is a common approach\nto estimating future sales.\nFigure 18.7 Historical Sales Data\nWe can see at first glance that sales remain fairly steady from January to April.

Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For example, if the company has a goal of maintaining a certain level of inventory or a\nminimum balance in its cash account, that information can be used to guide the estimate for those accounts.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n549\n18.5\nForecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a cash flow forecast.\n•\nAssess a cash flow forecast to determine future cash funding needs.\n•\nUse pro forma financial statements and cash flow forecasts to assess the value of growth to the firm.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will use the forecasted income statement, forecasted balance sheet, and\nother information we know about the firm’s policies and goals for the coming year to generate and assess a\ncash flow forecast.\nCreate a Cash Flow Forecast\nA cash flow forecast isn’t overly complex, yet it is not easy to assemble because it requires making many\nassumptions about the future. A cash forecast begins with the beginning cash balance, adds anticipated cash\ninflows, and deducts anticipated cash outflows. This identifies cash surpluses and shortages.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, we see in Figure 18.15 that the company begins with cash of\n$42,581,000 in January of the new year. Next, it lists the cash inflows, or cash received from customers. Given\nthe assumption that customers pay in 90-day terms, the cash flow is filled in by plugging in the sales forecast\nfor the three prior months. For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the\nnet sales forecast for March (see Figure 18.13).",

Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase",

Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential\nchanges they are considering. They may reduce the new salaries package by a percentage point to see if it\ngets them closer to their goal. They may adjust cost of goods sold by a certain percentage if they feel they can\nnegotiate with vendors to work down their costs. They may adjust rent and see if they can find a better retail\nlocation to either reduce costs or increase sales due to increased foot traffic in a new location. They may save\nan entirely new version of the forecast and change it drastically to see what investing in opening a second\nretail location would do.\nAs you can see, the list of possibilities is endless. Though the main goal of financial managers may be cash\nplanning, the power of a well-developed forecast is tremendous. It can help assess potential growth, new\nopportunities, and even small changes in the business as well.\nSensitivity Analysis in Forecasting\nSensitivity analysis will often look at the change in just one variable rather than the entire scenario. It\nexamines how sensitive a particular output (commonly net income) will be to a change in a particular\nunderlying input (sales or costs, for example). What if sales are 10% more or less than forecasted? What if the\nprices the firm can charge its customers are 10% more or less? What if the cost of goods sold increases by\n10%? The purpose is to see which variables are crucial to “get right.” It isn’t worth spending a lot of research\ndollars to make sure you are accurately predicting a variable if that variable won’t notably change the\noutcome. However, a slight change in other variables may have significant impact.\nUsing pro forma financial statements created in Excel allows management to quickly generate new pro forma\nfinancials and see the impact that each possible variable might have on the overall financial results.",

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.",

Three of the financial\nratios covered in that chapter are brought back into this chapter’s discussion to demonstrate how financial\nmanagers examine working capital and liquidity. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted\ninto cash. Those ratios are the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio. A higher ratio indicates a\ngreater level of liquidity.\nThe formulas for the three liquidity ratios are:\nNotice how the current ratio includes the two elements of net working capital—current assets and current\nliabilities. It makes for a quick comparison of relative size or proportion.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCurrent Ratio\nA company has $2,000,000 of current assets, while its current liabilities are $1,000,000. What is the current\nratio, and what does it mean?\nSolution:\nThe current ratio would be\nwhich is a 2:1 proportion of current asset value to\nthe amount of the current liabilities.

Industry averages can be aspirational, motivating management to set\nliquidity goals and best practices for working capital management.\nIt is common to think about working capital with a simple assumption: current assets are being “financed” by\ncurrent liabilities.

In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a long operating cycle because of the\nproduction process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current\nratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much\nlower current ratios.\nIn recent years, Walmart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has had a current ratio of around 0.9 and has been able to\nmanage its working capital needs by efficient management of its supply chain, quick turnover of inventory,\nand a very small investment in accounts receivables.1 Big retailers like Walmart are effective at negotiating\nfavorable payment terms with their vendors.

With a credit card, a consumer opens an account with a credit limit. Most trade credit is\noffered to a company with an open account that has a credit limit up to which the company can purchase\ngoods or services without having to pay the cash up front. As long as the payments are made in accordance\nwith the terms of the agreement (also called credit terms), no interest or additional fees are charged on the\ncredit balance except possibly for a fee for late payment.\nInitially, the vendor’s credit department approves both a trade credit limit and credit payment terms (i.e.,\nnumber of days after the invoice date that payment is due). Timely payments on accounts payable (trade\ncredit) helps create a credit history for the purchasing firm.\nTrade Credit Terms\nTrade credit arrangements often carry credit terms that offer an incentive, called a discount, for a company\n(the buyer) to pay its bill within a relatively short period of time. Net terms, also referred to as the full credit\nperiod, are the number of days that a business (purchaser) has before they must pay their invoice. A common\nnet term is Net 30, with payment due in full within 30 days of the invoice.\nMany vendors also offer cash discounts to customers that pay their bill early. A company’s invoice that\nspecifies payment terms of “2/10 n/30” (stated as: “two ten net 30”) would allow a 2 percent discount if the\nbuyer’s account balance is paid within 10 days of the invoice date; otherwise, the net amount owed would be\ndue in 30 days. The “10 days” in the example is the discount period—the number of days the buyer has to\ntake advantage of the cash discount for an early payment, also known as quick payment.\nFor example, Jackson’s Premium Jams Inc. received a $10,500 invoice for the purchase of jelly jars. The invoice\nhas payment terms of 2/10 n/30. Jackson’s pays the bill within 10 days of the invoice date. Jackson’s payment\nwould be\n.

Trade credit is similar to a loan, except that it does not involve a third party.

Using accounts payable to purchase goods and services can involve an\nopportunity cost—a cost of the forgone opportunity of making a quick payment and benefiting from a cash\ndiscount. A business that does not take advantage of a cash discount for early payment of trade credit will pay\nmore for goods and services than a business that routinely takes advantage of discounts.\nThe annual percentage rate of forgoing quick payment discounts can be estimated with the following formula:\nExample: Novelty Accessories Inc. (NAI) purchases products from a vendor that offers credit payment terms of\n2/10, net 30. The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73\npercent.\n19.3\nCash Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why firms hold cash.\n•\nList instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.\nCash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows. To manage\ncash, the cash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected",

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments.

For example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an uncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an uncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a total estimated uncollectible balance. The aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating how much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill down to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics. Accountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as bad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts receivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts receivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how much of its accounts receivable will never be collected."

Old\ninventory could mean obsolesce or, in the case of perishable goods, spoilage. In either case, old inventory\nmeans losses.\nImagine a company selling high-tech products such as consumer electronics. A high days in inventory ratio\ncould mean that technologically obsolete products will be sold at a discount. There are similar issues with\nolder inventory in the fashion industry. Last year’s styles are not as appealing to the fashion-conscious\nconsumer and are usually sold at significant discounts. In the accounting world, lower of cost or market value\nis a test of inventory value to determine if inventory needs to be “written down,” meaning that the company\ntakes an expense for inventory that has lost significant value. Lower of cost or market is required by Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to state inventory valuations at realistic and conservative values.\nInventory is a very significant working capital component for many companies, such as manufacturers,\nwholesalers, and retailers. For those companies, inventory management involves management of the entire\nsupply chain: sourcing, storing, and selling inventory. At its very basic level, inventory management means\nhaving the right amount of stock at the right place and at the right time while also minimizing the cost of\ninventory. This concept is explained in the next section.\nInventory Cost\nControlling inventory costs minimizes working capital needs and, ultimately, the cost of goods sold. Inventory\nmanagement impacts profitability; minimizing cost of goods sold means maximizing gross profit (Gross Profit\n= Net Sales Less Cost of Goods Sold).\nThere are four components to inventory cost:\n•\nPurchasing costs: the invoice amount (after discounts) for inventory; the initial investment in inventory\n19.5 • Inventory Management\n583\n•\nCarrying costs: all costs of having inventory in stock, which includes storage costs (i.e., the cost of the\nspace to store the inventory, such as a warehouse), insurance, inventory obsolescence and spoilage, and\neven the opportunity cost of the investment in inventory\n•\nOrdering costs: the costs of placing an order with a vendor; the cost of a purchase and managing the\npayment process\n•\nStockout costs: an opportunity cost incurred when a customer order cannot be filled and the customer\ngoes elsewhere for the product; lost revenue",

Customers are disappointed if they cannot see and touch the item or if they\nfind out upon arrival at the store that it is out of stock.\nCustomers of all kinds don’t want to wait for the delivery of a purchase.

The budgeting process of a company is a really an integrated process—it links a\nseries of budgets together so that company objectives can be achieved.

The purpose of the cash budget is to estimate\ncash flows, to help ensure sufficient cash balances are maintained during the planning period, and to plan for\nexternal financing during periods of cash deficits.\nWhen a budget is prepared in Excel, cash budget analysts can play “what if” with different scenarios to see\nwhen cash surpluses and deficits are expected. Cash surpluses means that funds can be invested in\nmarketable securities to earn a rate of return, while cash deficits mean that financing, such as a line of credit,\nwill be necessary (assuming forecasts are accurate).\nAlthough the example shown in Figure 19.10 is a monthly cash budget, a cash budget could be prepared using\nany useful time elements: weekly, monthly, or quarterly.\nOne common practice is to use a rolling cash budget. A rolling cash budget is continually updated to add a\nnew budget period, such as a month’s amount of cash flow activity, as the most recent budgeted month\nexpires. For example, assume that a 12-month cash budget is prepared for a period covering January 20X1 to\nDecember 20X1. Once the month of January 20X1 has concluded, a 12-month planning period continues by\nadd January 20X2 to the last column of the budget. The rolling cash monthly budget is an extension of the\ninitial cash budget model, adding one month and thereby always extending cash flow projections one year\ninto the future.\nFigure 19.9 Operating Expenses Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n587\nFigure 19.10 Sample Cash Budget\nUsing Figure 19.9 as an example, Table 19.5 shows the formulas that form the skeleton of a monthly cash\nbudget.\nBeginning\nCash Balance\nThis is the amount of cash the company expects to have on the first day of the month.

The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables. The credit managers’ mantra rings true: “The\nolder the receivable, the greater the likelihood that the account will not be collected.”\n19.5 Inventory Management\nInventory, usually the least liquid of the current assets, presents its own set of management challenges.\nFinding the optimal level of inventory is probably more of an art than a science. JIT helps to reduce the\ninvestment in inventory and lower the costs of storage, but stockout costs can be very damaging to\nprofitability.\n19.6 Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\nShort-term plans of a business are funded with cash, with cash budgets being a critical tool of planning. The\ncash budget takes into account a target amount of cash, factoring in all the motives for holding cash. A cash\nbudget looks ahead—predicting cash inflows and outflows, allocating for minimum cash balances to be\nmaintained, and helping management determine short-term financing needed.

The three major areas of focus for the financial manager are the size, the timing, and the riskiness\nof the cash flows of the company. Broadly, the financial manager should work to\n•\nincrease cash coming into the company and decrease cash going out of the company;\n•\nspeed up cash coming into the company and slow down cash going out of the company; and\n•\ndecrease the riskiness of both money coming in and money going out of the company.\nThe first item in this list is obvious. The more revenue a company has, the more profitable it will be.\nBusinesspeople talk about “top line” growth when discussing this objective because revenue appears at the\ntop of the company’s income statement. Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book.

In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future.

The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee.

A change in the\nmarket price of these raw materials can significantly impact the profitability of a company.\nFor example, Starbucks must purchase coffee beans in order to make its coffee drinks. The price of coffee\nbeans is highly volatile. Sample prices of a pound of Arabica coffee beans over the past couple of decades are\nshown in Table 20.1. Over this period, the price of coffee beans ranged from a low of $0.52 per pound in the\nsummer of 2002 to a high of over $3.00 per pound in the spring of 2011. The costs, and thus the profits, of\nStarbucks will vary greatly depending on if the company is paying less than $1.00 per pound for coffee or if it is\npaying three times that much.\nDate\nPrice per Pound ($)\nJanuary 1, 2000\n1.09\nJanuary 1, 2004\n0.74\nJanuary 1, 2008\n1.39\nJanuary 1, 2012\n2.41\nJanuary 1, 2016\n1.46\nJanuary 1, 2020\n1.50\nTable 20.1 Price of Coffee in Select Years,\n2000-20205\nLong-Term Contracts\nOne method of hedging the risk of volatile input prices is for a firm to enter into long-term contracts with its\nsuppliers. Starbucks, for example, could enter into an agreement with a coffee farmer to purchase a particular\nquantity of coffee beans at a predetermined price over the next several years.\nThese long-term contracts can benefit both the buyer and the seller. The buyer is concerned that rising\ncommodity prices will increase its cost of goods sold. The seller, however, is concerned that falling commodity\nprices will mean lower revenue. By entering into a long-term contract, the buyer is able to lock in a price for its\nraw materials and the seller is able to lock in its sales price. Thus, both parties are able to reduce uncertainty.\nWhile long-term contracts reduce uncertainty about the commodity price, and thus reduce risk, there are\nseveral possible disadvantages to these types of contracts. First, both parties are exposed to the risk that the\nother party may default and fail to live up to the terms of the contract. Second, these contracts cannot be",

For Starbucks, a vertical integration would involve\nStarbucks owning a coffee bean farm. If the price of coffee beans rises, the firm’s costs increase and the\nsupplier’s revenues rise. The two companies can offset these risks by merging.\nAlthough vertical integration can reduce commodity price risk, it is not a perfect hedge. Starbucks may\ndecrease its commodity price risk by purchasing a coffee farm, but that action may expose it to other risks,\nsuch as land ownership and employment risk.\nFutures Contracts\nAnother method of hedging commodity price risk is the use of a futures contract. A commodity futures\ncontract is designed to avoid some of the disadvantages of entering into a long-term contract with a supplier.\nA futures contract is an agreement to trade an asset on some future date at a price locked in today. Futures\nexist for a range of commodities, including natural resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, silver, and gold and\nagricultural products such as soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, sugar, and cocoa.\nFutures contracts are traded anonymously on an exchange; the market price is publicly observable, and the\nmarket is highly liquid.

Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the\nexpenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.\nThe Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in\nFigure 20.3. In 2012, $1.00 could be purchased with fewer than 80 Japanese yen. In 2015, it took over 120 yen to\npurchase $1.00.\nFigure 20.3 Japanese Yen to One US Dollar8\nIf a company is receiving yen from customers and paying expenses in dollars, the company is harmed when\nthe yen depreciates relative to the dollar, meaning that the yen the company receives from its customers can\nbe exchanged for fewer dollars. Conversely, when the yen appreciates, it takes fewer yen to purchase each\ndollar; this appreciation of the yen benefits companies with revenues in yen and expenses in dollars.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nProjecting Sales in US Dollars\nThe managers of a firm think that the exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollars will be\nnext year.

A\nforward contract is simply a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of\ncurrencies at a future date.

This contract is similar to your agreeing with a hotel that you\nwill arrive on March 1 and rent a room for three nights at $200 per night. You are agreeing today to show up at\nthe hotel on a future (specified) date and pay the quoted price when you arrive. The hotel agrees to provide\nyou the room on March 1 and cannot change the price of the room when you arrive. With a forward contract,\nyou are also agreeing that you will indeed make the purchase and you cannot change your mind; so, using the\nhotel room analogy, this would mean that the hotel will definitely charge your credit card for the agreed-upon\n$200 per night on March 1.\nThe forward contract is an individualized contract between the buyer and the seller; they are both under a",

                    "answer": "A forward contract is a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of currencies at a future date. A company can approach its bank, for example, saying that it will need to purchase 200 million Korean won on March 1. The bank will quote a forward rate, which is a rate specified today for the sale of currency on a future date, and the company and the bank can enter into a forward contract to exchange dollars for 200 million Korean won at the quoted rate on March 1."

            "chunk": "you are also agreeing that you will indeed make the purchase and you cannot change your mind; so, using the\nhotel room analogy, this would mean that the hotel will definitely charge your credit card for the agreed-upon\n$200 per night on March 1.\nThe forward contract is an individualized contract between the buyer and the seller; they are both under a\ncontractual obligation to honor the contract. Because this contract is not standardized like the futures contract\n(so that it can be traded on an exchange), it can be tailored to the needs of the two parties. While the forward\ncontract has the advantage of being fine-tuned to meet the company’s needs, it has a risk, known as\ncounterparty risk, that the futures contract does not have. The forward contract is only as good as the promise\nof the counterparty. If the company enters into a forward contract to purchase 200 million Korean won on\nMarch 1 from its bank and the bank goes out of business before March 1, the company will not be able to\nmake the exchange with a nonexistent bank. The exchanges on which futures contracts are traded guard the\npurchaser of a futures contract from this type of risk by guaranteeing the contract.\nNatural Hedges\nA hedge simply refers to a reduction in the risk or exposure that a company has to volatility and uncertainty.\nWe have been focusing on how a company might use financial market instruments to hedge, but sometimes a\ncompany can use a natural hedge to mitigate risk. A natural hedge occurs when a business can offset its risk\nsimply through its own operations. With a natural hedge, when a risk occurs that would decrease the value of\na company, an offsetting event occurs within the firm that increases the value of the company.\nAs an example, consider a British-based travel agency. One of the major tours the company offers is a tour of\nItaly. The company arranges for transportation, lodging, meals, and sightseeing for Brits to visit the highlights\nof Rome, Florence, and Venice. Because the company charges customers in British pounds but must pay the\nbus companies, hotels, and other service providers in Italy in euros, the travel agency faces significant\ntransaction exposure. If the value of the British pound depreciates after the company sets the price it will\ncharge for the tour but before it pays the Italian suppliers, the company will be harmed. In fact, if the British\npound depreciates by a great deal, the company could end up in a situation in which the British pounds it",

                    "answer": "A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a specified future date. The price is determined at the time of the contract and does not change during the life of the contract. A futures contract is similar to a forward contract, but it is traded on an exchange and is standardized. This means that the contract has specific terms, such as the quantity and quality of the asset, and the delivery date. The price of a futures contract is determined by the market, and it can change during the life of the contract. The main advantage of a forward contract is that it can be tailored to the specific needs of the two parties involved. The disadvantage is that there is counterparty risk, which means that the party that is obligated to buy or sell the asset may not be able to fulfill its obligation. The main advantage of a futures contract is that it is standardized, which means that it is easier to trade and there is less counterparty risk. The disadvantage is that it is not as flexible as a forward contract, and the price can be volatile."

                    "answer": "A natural hedge is a way for a company to reduce its exposure to risk by using its own operations. For example, a company that sells products in multiple currencies can use a natural hedge to reduce its exposure to currency risk. If the company has operations in multiple countries, it can use a natural hedge to reduce its exposure to political risk. A natural hedge can also be used to reduce exposure to interest rate risk. For example, a company that has a large amount of debt can use a natural hedge to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk by having a portion of its debt in fixed-rate loans and a portion in floating-rate loans. A natural hedge can also be used to reduce exposure to commodity price risk. For example, a company that uses a lot of a particular commodity in its production process can use a natural hedge to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk by having a portion of its inventory in the commodity and a portion in the finished product."

Just as other prices are volatile, interest rates are also\nvolatile. Just as volatility in other prices leads to uncertain cash flows for a company, volatility in interest rates\ncan also lead to uncertain cash flows.\nMeasuring Interest Rate Risk\nSuppose that a company is supposed to pay a bill of $1,000 in 10 years. The present value of this bill depends\non the level of interest rates. If the interest rate is 5%, the present value of the bill is\n. If\nthe interest rate rises to 6%, the present value of the bill is\n. The increase in the interest\nrate by 1% causes the present value of the expected cash flow to fall by\n.\nInterest rate risk can be highlighted by looking at bonds. Consider two $1,000 face value bonds with a 5%\ncoupon rate, paid semiannually. One of the bonds matures in five years, and the other bond matures in 30\nyears. If the market interest rate is 5%, each of these bonds will sell for face value, or $1,000. If, instead, the\nmarket interest rate is 6%, the five-year bond will sell for $957.35 and the 30-year bond will sell for $861.62.\nNotice that as the interest rate rises, the price of both of these bonds will fall. However, the price of the longer-\nterm bond will fall by more than the price of the shorter-term bond. The longer-term bond price will fall by\n1.38%; the shorter-term bond price will fall by only 0.43%.\nConsider two additional $1,000 face value bonds. The difference is that these bonds have a 6% coupon rate,\npaid semiannually. If a bond has a 6% coupon rate and matures in five years, it will sell for $1,043.76 when the\nmarket interest rate is 5%.

Duration is an\nimportant measure of interest rate risk that incorporates the maturity and coupon rate of a bond as well as\nthe level of current market interest rates. Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of\nthis introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that\n•\nthe higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate\n9\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n615\nchanges;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.\nSwap-Based Hedging\nAs the name suggests, a swap involves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something. Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes\nup and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank",

The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases.
