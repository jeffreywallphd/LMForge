Black’s Law Dictionary says that law is “a \nbody of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force. That \nwhich must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1] \n \nFunctions of the Law \nIn a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual \nrights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly \nsocial change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \nauthoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \nor political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism, \nEuropean nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \nthose same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by \nSpain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of",

Describe the constitutional issue that questions whether administrative agencies could have authority to \nmake enforceable rules that affect business. \n \n \nWhy Have Administrative Agencies? \nThe US Constitution mentions only three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial \n(Articles I, II, and III). There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution, even though federal agencies \nare sometimes referred to as “the fourth branch of government.” The Supreme Court has recognized the \nlegitimacy of federal administrative agencies to make rules that have the same binding effect as \nstatutes by Congress. \n \nMost commentators note that having agencies with rule-making power is a practical necessity: (1) \nCongress does not have the expertise or continuity to develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g., \ncommunications, the environment, aviation).

Note, however, that not every agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is entirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, people may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food rather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions of the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—from those that are not."

First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In",

According to the comment, RUPA \ndramatically changes the law governing partnership breakups and dissolution. An entirely new concept, \n“dissociation,” is used in lieu of UPA term “dissolution” to denote the change in the relationship caused by \na partner’s ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business. “Dissolution” is retained but with a \ndifferent meaning. The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm \nitself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. \n \nUnder UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any \nmember from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an \nentity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs \nwhen any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA \nrequires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. \n \nDissociation",

Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634.

These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term.

Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock.

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.

In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies.

Double\ndeclining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under\nstraight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a\nfive-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year.\nNext, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-\n118\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndeclining method takes usage into account by doubling the straight-line percentage.

Changes in market value of big-\nticket items like land or buildings are not reflected in the balance sheet.

When more money is available, consumers and businesses will buy more goods and services. However, when the supply of goods and services is not increased to meet the increased demand, prices for those goods and services will rise. This is the essence of inflation. When inflation occurs, the purchasing power of money decreases over time. This means that a dollar today will not buy as much as a dollar tomorrow. This is because prices for goods and services will be higher tomorrow than they are today. In order to maintain the same level of purchasing power, consumers and businesses must earn more money in the future than they do today. This is the impact of inflation on TVM."

When the manager left the room for a few minutes, we pulled out a financial calculator and proved in less\nthan a minute that the actual interest rate in the payments he was proposing was nearly double the quoted\nand advertised rate.\nIn addition to understanding how the loan process works, which improves your negotiation skills when\nborrowing, businesses and individuals can better control their investments by understanding basic rules of",

The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore\nthis bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to\ncompound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (see Table 8.6).\nMonth Interest Balance\n1,000.00\n1\n15.00 1,015.00\n2\n15.23 1,030.23\n3\n15.45 1,045.69\n4\n15.69 1,061.36\n5\n15.92 1.077.28\n6\n16.16 1,093.44\n7\n16.40 1,109.84\n8\n16.65 1,126.49\n9",

The practice of offering such loans can be controversial because it can lead to\nvery high rates of interest, perhaps even illegally high, in an act known as usury. Although some states have\noutlawed PALs and others place limits on them, some do not. A PAL is a short-term loan in anticipation of a\nperson’s next paycheck. A person in need of money for short-term needs will write a check on Thursday but\ndate the check next Thursday, which is their normal payday; assume this transaction is for $200. The lender,\ntypically operating from a storefront, will advance the $200 cash and hold the postdated check. The lender\ncharges a fee—let’s say $14—as their compensation. The following Thursday, the borrower is expected to pay\noff the advance, and if they do not, the lender can deposit the postdated check. If that check has insufficient\nfunds, more fees and penalties will likely be assessed.",

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management.

Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\nhigher return.

Remember that a bond is a financial asset that a company sells to raise money\nfrom willing investors.

A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public.
