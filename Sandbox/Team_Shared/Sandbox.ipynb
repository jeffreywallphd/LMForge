However, the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth.

The German hyperinflation of the 1920s and the Zimbabwean hyperinflation of the 2000s are notable examples. After World War II, many countries adopted the Bretton Woods system, which pegged their currencies to the US dollar.

When the money supply increases faster than the availability of goods and services, the value of each unit of currency decreases, leading to higher prices. Monetarists advocate for central banks to control the money supply to maintain price stability.\",\n",

According to Keynesian economics, inflation can be caused by demand-pull factors, where an increase in aggregate demand (due to government spending, consumer spending, or investment) exceeds the economy's ability to produce goods and services. This leads to upward pressure on prices. Keynesians also acknowledge the role of cost-push factors, such as rising wages or raw material costs, in causing inflation. They often suggest fiscal and monetary policies to manage aggregate demand.\",\n",
      "        \"Supply-side view: The supply-side view focuses on factors that affect the supply of goods and services. According to this view, inflation can be caused by reductions in aggregate supply, such as supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, or government regulations that restrict production. When the supply of goods and services decreases while demand remains constant, prices tend to rise. Supply-side economists often advocate for policies that promote production and reduce the cost of doing business.\",\n",
      "        \"Rational expectations theory: Rational expectations theory suggests that people's expectations about future inflation play a significant role in determining current inflation. If people expect prices to rise in the future, they will demand higher wages and businesses will raise prices, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy. This theory implies that credible monetary policy is crucial for managing inflation, as it can influence people's expectations.\",\n",
      "        \"The quantity theory of money states that the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation, or money supply. The equation of exchange, M V = P T, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money (the average number of times a unit of money is spent in a given period), P is the price level, and T is the volume of transactions. If V and T are relatively stable, then an increase in M will lead to an increase in P. This theory is a cornerstone of the monetarist view of inflation.\",\n",
      "        \"Money supply: The money supply is the total amount of currency in circulation and demand deposits in an economy. An excessive increase in the money supply, not matched by an increase in real output, is widely considered a primary cause of sustained inflation. Central banks manage the money supply through various tools, such as interest rates, open market operations, and reserve requirements.\",\n",
      "        \"Government spending and fiscal policy: Government spending can contribute to inflation if it leads to an increase in aggregate demand that exceeds the economy's productive capacity. Fiscal policies, such as tax cuts or increased government spending, can stimulate demand and potentially lead to inflation if not managed carefully. When governments finance their spending by printing money (monetizing the debt), it directly increases the money supply and can lead to hyperinflation.\",\n",

High inflation can also lead to a redistribution of wealth, as debtors benefit from repaying loans with money that is worth less than when they borrowed it, while creditors lose. It can also lead to 'menu costs' (the cost of businesses having to change prices) and 'shoe-leather costs' (the cost of people having to make more trips to the bank to manage their money).

A moderate amount of inflation can help to lubricate the labor market, as it allows real wages to fall without nominal wages being cut, which can be difficult for workers to accept.

      "        \"Consumer Price Index (CPI): The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It is a widely used measure of inflation and is often used to adjust wages, pensions, and other payments for inflation. Different countries use slightly different methodologies for calculating their CPI.\",\n",
      "        \"Producer Price Index (PPI): The PPI measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It is an indicator of inflationary pressures at the wholesale or producer level and can often foreshadow changes in the CPI.\",\n",
      "        \"Wholesale Price Index (WPI): The WPI measures the average change in the prices of goods at the wholesale level. It is similar to the PPI and is used in some countries as a key measure of inflation.\",\n",
      "        \"Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index: The PCE price index measures the average change over time in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States. It is preferred by the Federal Reserve as a measure of inflation because it accounts for changes in consumer behavior and substitution effects. The core PCE index excludes volatile food and energy prices.\",\n",
      "        \"GDP deflator: The GDP deflator measures the average level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. It is a broader measure of inflation than the CPI or PPI, as it includes investment goods and government purchases, not just consumer goods. It is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP and multiplying by 100.\",\n",
      "        \"Headline inflation vs. core inflation: Headline inflation refers to the raw inflation figure reported through the CPI, PPI, or WPI. Core inflation excludes the prices of volatile items like food and energy from the overall inflation measure. Central banks often focus on core inflation to get a better sense of underlying inflationary trends, as food and energy prices can fluctuate significantly due to temporary supply shocks.\",\n",
      "        \"Hedonic adjustments: Hedonic adjustments are used in price indexes to account for changes in the quality of goods and services over time. For example, if a new computer is more powerful than an older model but costs the same, a hedonic adjustment would treat this as a price decrease, reflecting the increased value for money. This helps to prevent price indexes from overstating inflation by not accounting for quality improvements.\",\n",
      "        \"Median CPI and Trimmed-mean CPI: These are alternative measures of core inflation that aim to reduce the impact of extreme price changes in specific categories. The median CPI measures the inflation rate of the component whose price change is in the middle of the distribution of all price changes. The trimmed-mean CPI excludes a certain percentage of the highest and lowest price changes from the calculation, providing a more stable measure of underlying inflation.\"\n",

      "        \"- Interest rates: Central banks can raise or lower policy interest rates (e.g., the federal funds rate in the US, the repo rate in the UK). Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which discourages spending and investment, thereby reducing aggregate demand and inflationary pressures. Lower interest rates have the opposite effect.\",\n",
      "        \"- Open market operations: Central banks can buy or sell government securities in the open market. Selling securities reduces the money supply, while buying securities increases it. This directly affects the amount of money in circulation.\",\n",
      "        \"- Reserve requirements: Central banks can set the minimum reserves that banks must hold. Increasing reserve requirements reduces the amount of money banks have available to lend, thereby contracting the money supply. This tool is used less frequently.\",\n",
      "        \"Inflation targeting: Many central banks, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of Australia, have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework. Under this framework, the central bank publicly announces a target inflation rate (e.g., 2% per year) and then uses its policy tools to steer inflation towards that target. This approach aims to anchor inflation expectations and provide transparency.\",\n",
      "        \"Exchange rate policy: In some countries, particularly those with fixed exchange rates, exchange rate policy can be used to control inflation. By pegging its currency to a stable foreign currency, a country can import the monetary discipline of the anchor country, thus helping to keep domestic inflation in check. However, this limits the central bank's ability to conduct independent monetary policy.\",\n",
      "        \"Wage and price controls: Wage and price controls are government interventions that directly limit how much wages and prices can increase. These controls have been used in various countries, particularly during wartime or periods of high inflation. However, they are generally considered to be ineffective in the long run and can lead to shortages, black markets, and distortions in the economy. Economists generally prefer market-based solutions.\",\n",

Reducing government spending or increasing taxes can decrease aggregate demand, thereby reducing inflationary pressures.
