Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed.

In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)?

In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1]",

By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery.

Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court.

In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company.

Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice. \n \nFrom a modern perspective, some of these virtues seem old-fashioned or even odd.

Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy.

They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring.

You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex.

Then, \nassuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: \n1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions \nthat might be made here? \n2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made. \n3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision. \n4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values. \n5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which \ndecision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders. \n \nIt is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why. In Milton \nFriedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders. In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods \nMarket, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come \nfirst, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 \"Corporations \nand Corporate Governance\"). \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n62 \nThe Core Values \nHere are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nTrustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be \nsincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and \ndon’t betray a trust.

Be loyal—stand by \nyour family, friends, co-workers, community, and nation; be discreet with information that \ncomes into your hands; don’t spread rumors or engage in harmful gossip; don’t violate your \nprinciples just to win friendship or approval; don’t ask a friend to do something that is",

Shareholders \nelect directors, who then hire officers to manage the company. From this structure, some very basic \nrealities follow. Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers \nhired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are \nnot always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law \nrequire officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the \ncompany. This is the “agency problem” often discussed in corporate governance: how to get officers and \nother top management to align their own interests with those of the shareholders. For example, a CEO \nmight trade insider information to the detriment of the company’s shareholders. Even board members are \nsusceptible to misalignment of interets; for example, board members might resist hostile takeover bids \nbecause they would likely lose their perks (short for perquisites) as directors, even though the tender offer \nwould benefit stockholders. Among other attempted realignments, the use of stock options was an \nattempt to make managers more attentive to the value of company stock, but the law of unintended \nconsequences was in full force; managers tweaked and managed earnings in the bubble of the 1990s bull \nmarket, and “managing by numbers” became an epidemic in corporations organized under US corporate \nlaw.

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities?

Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist. But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations.

Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response.

If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay. Most Fortune 500 companies have ethics hotlines and processes in place to find legal and ethical \nproblems within the company. \n \nManaging by the Numbers",

Understanding the long-standing \nperspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting \nout the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses. Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices. A firm that has purpose and passion \nbeyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself \nfor long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nConsider again Milton Friedman’s article. \na. What does Friedman mean by “ethical custom”? \nb. If the laws of the society are limiting the company’s profitability, would the company be within \nits rights to disobey the law? \nc. \nWhat if the law is “on the books,” but the company could count on a lack of enforcement from \nstate officials who were overworked and underpaid? Should the company limit its profits? \nSuppose that it could save money by discharging a pollutant into a nearby river, adversely \naffecting fish and, potentially, drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities. In \npolluting against laws that aren’t enforced, is it still acting “within the rules of the game”? What \nif almost all other companies in the industry were saving money by doing similar acts? \n2 \nConsider again the Harris v. Forklift case at the end of Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Law and Legal \nSystems\". The Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Harris was entitled to be heard again by the federal \ndistrict court, which means that there would be a trial on her claim that Mr. Hardy, owner of Forklift \nSystems, had created a “hostile working environment” for Ms. Harris. Apart from the legal aspects, \ndid he really do anything unethical? How can you tell? \na. Which of his actions, if any, were contrary to utilitarian thinking?",

This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial function \nhas original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to \nthem. A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states). Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85",

The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills.

The exception to this is diversity jurisdiction, \ndiscussed later. \n \nThe Constitution was constructed with the idea that state courts would continue to deal with basic kinds \nof claims such as tort, contract, or property claims.

This is not merely a matter of counting the number of witnesses or of the length of time that they \ntalk: the judge in a trial without a jury (a bench trial), or the jury where one is impaneled, must apply the \npreponderance of evidence test by determining which side has the greater weight of credible, relevant \nevidence. \n \nAdjudication and the adversary system imply certain other characteristics of courts.

This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence.

Understand the posttrial process—how appellate courts process appeals. \n2. Explain how a court’s judgment is translated into relief for the winning party. \n \n \nJudgment or Order \nAt the end of a trial, the judge will enter an order that makes findings of fact (often with the help of a jury) \nand conclusions of law. The judge will also make a judgment as to what relief or remedy should be given. \nOften it is an award of money damages to one of the parties. The losing party may ask for a new trial at \nthis point or within a short period of time following. Once the trial judge denies any such request, the \njudgment—in the form of the court’s order—is final. \n \nAppeal \nIf the loser’s motion for a new trial or a judgment n.o.v. is denied, the losing party may appeal but must \nordinarily post a bond sufficient to ensure that there are funds to pay the amount awarded to the winning \nparty. In an appeal, the appellant aims to show that there was some prejudicial error committed by the \ntrial judge. There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic \nidea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides. Enforcement \nof the court’s judgment—an award of money, an injunction—is usually stayed (postponed) until the \nappellate court has ruled. As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the \nparty defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent). \n \nDuring the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge. In \ncompiling a record on appeal, the appellant needs to show the appellate court some examples of mistakes \nmade by the judge—for example, having erroneously admitted evidence, having failed to admit proper \nevidence that should have been admitted, or having wrongly instructed the jury. The appellate court must \ndetermine if those mistakes were serious enough to amount to prejudicial error. \n \nAppellate and trial procedures are different.

Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts. \n2. Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n121 \n \n \nAlmost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney. But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional?

Time—and \nthe Supreme Court—will tell. \n \nClass Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n122 \nMost lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other \norganization. But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave.

Understand the various ways that lawyers charge for services. \n2. Describe the contingent fee system in the United States. \n3. Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n \nLegal Fees \nLawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. \nA flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance \napproximately how long it will take her to do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are \nexamples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the \nworth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price. \n \nLawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial \nmatters. Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range \nfrom $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time. \n \nA contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the \nsuccess of the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., \nautomobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite often, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n125 \ncontingent fee is controversial. Trial lawyers justify it by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such \nlawsuits. A typical automobile accident case can cost at least ten thousand dollars to prepare, and a \ncomplicated products-liability case can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Few people have that kind of \nmoney or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit. Corporate and \nprofessional defendants complain that the contingent fee gives lawyers a license to go big game hunting, \nor to file suits against those with deep pockets in the hopes of forcing them to settle. \n \nTrial lawyers respond that the contingent fee arrangement forces them to screen cases and weed out cases",

That is not the general rule in this country. Here, each party must pay \nmost of its own costs, including (and especially) the fees of lawyers. (Certain relatively minor costs, such \nas filing fees for various documents required in court, are chargeable to the losing side, if the judge \ndecides it.) This type of fee structure is known as the American rule (in contrast to the British rule). \n \nThere are two types of exceptions to the American rule. By statute, Congress and the state legislatures \nhave provided that the winning party in particular classes of cases may recover its full legal costs from the \nloser—for example, the federal antitrust laws so provide and so does the federal Equal Access to Justice \nAct. The other exception applies to litigants who either initiate lawsuits in bad faith, with no expectation \nof winning, or who defend them in bad faith, in order to cause the plaintiff great expense.

No law requires parties who have a legal dispute to seek \njudicial resolution if they can resolve their disagreement privately or through some other public \nforum. In fact, the threat of a lawsuit can frequently motivate parties toward private negotiation. \nFiling a lawsuit may convince one party that the other party is serious.

Bar associations, other private groups, and the courts themselves wanted to find \nquicker and cheaper ways for litigants and potential litigants to settle certain types of quarrels than \nthrough the courts. As a result, neighborhood justice centers or dispute resolution centers have sprung up \nin communities. These are where people can come for help in settling disputes, of both civil and criminal \nnature, that should not consume the time and money of the parties or courts in lengthy proceedings. \n \nThese alternative forums use a variety of methods, including arbitration, mediation, and conciliation, to \nbring about agreement or at least closure of the dispute.

These methods are not all alike, and their \ndifferences are worth noting. \n \nArbitration is a type of adjudication. The parties use a private decision maker, the arbitrator, and the \nrules of procedure are considerably more relaxed than those that apply in the courtroom. Arbitrators \nmight be retired judges, lawyers, or anyone with the kind of specialized knowledge and training that \nwould be useful in making a final, binding decision on the dispute. In a contractual relationship, the \nparties can decide even before a dispute arises to use arbitration when the time comes. Or parties can \ndecide after a dispute arises to use arbitration instead of litigation. In a predispute arbitration agreement \n(often part of a larger contract), the parties can spell out the rules of procedure to be used and the method \nfor choosing the arbitrator. For example, they may name the specific person or delegate the responsibility \nof choosing to some neutral person, or they may each designate a person and the two designees may \njointly pick a third arbitrator. \n \nMany arbitrations take place under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, a private \norganization headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many other cities. The association uses \npublished sets of rules for various types of arbitration (e.g., labor arbitration or commercial arbitration); \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n128 \nparties who provide in contracts for arbitration through the association are agreeing to be bound by the \nassociation’s rules.

The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding, with very \nfew exceptions (such as fraud or manifest disregard of the law by the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators). \nSaying that arbitration is favored means that if you have agreed to arbitration, you can’t go to court if the \nother party wants you to arbitrate. Under the Federal Arbitration Act, the other party can go to court and \nget a stay against your litigation and also get an order compelling you to go to arbitration. \n \nMediation \nUnlike adjudication, mediation gives the neutral party no power to impose a decision. The mediator is a \ngo-between who attempts to help the parties negotiate a solution. The mediator will communicate the \nparties’ positions to each other, will facilitate the finding of common ground, and will suggest outcomes. \nBut the parties have complete control: they may ignore the recommendations of the mediator entirely, \nsettle in their own way, find another mediator, agree to binding arbitration, go to court, or forget the \nwhole thing! \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n129 \nLitigation is not the only way to resolve disputes. Informal negotiation between the disputants usually comes \nfirst, but both mediation and arbitration are available. Arbitration, though, is final and binding.

Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and \nsmall states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states \nhave two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the \npresidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. \nArticle II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the \nelection process.

Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI).

Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch.

The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is \nbrought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business \nafter Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited \nrather than overruled Roe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, \nand efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review.

The commerce clause gives Congress the exclusive power to make \nlaws relating to foreign trade and commerce and to commerce among the various states. Most of the \nfederally created legal environment springs from this one clause: if Congress is not authorized in the \nConstitution to make certain laws, then it acts unconstitutionally and its actions may be ruled \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Lately, the Supreme Court has not been shy about ruling acts of \nCongress unconstitutional. \n \nHere are the first five parts of Article I, Section 8, which sets forth the powers of the federal legislature. \nThe commerce clause is in boldface. It is short, but most federal legislation affecting business depends on \nthis very clause: \n \nSection 8 \n[Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; \nbut all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; \n[Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \n \n[Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes; \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n147 \n[Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of \nBankruptcies throughout the United States; \n \n[Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of \nWeights and Measures; \n \nEarly Commerce Clause Cases \nFor many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying the commerce clause: Congress could only \nuse it to legislate aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another. Anything else was deemed \nlocal rather than national. For example, In Hammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916 federal statute \nhad barred transportation in interstate commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing \nchildren under fourteen or employing children fourteen and above for more than eight hours a day. A \ncomplaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his \nown behalf and on behalf of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other \nbetween fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina.",

The court found that \nCongress did not. The court cited several cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be \nconstitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of \nlotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n148 \nfood and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement \nin prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.” [2] \n \nIn each of those instances, the Supreme Court said, “[T]he use of interstate transportation was necessary \nto the accomplishment of harmful results.” In other words, although the power over interstate \ntransportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of \ninterstate commerce to effect the evil intended. But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was \nlacking. The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the",

The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was \nchallenged on the ground that Congress lacked the power under the commerce clause to regulate what \nwas otherwise fairly local conduct.

This \nwas enough to sustain federal regulation based on the commerce clause. [3] \n \nFor nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that Congress could almost always find some \ninterstate commerce connection for any law it might pass. It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 \nwhen the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that \nprohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The law was part of a twenty-year trend \n(roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime. Lopez’s \nlawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged \nthe law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this \nlegislation. The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the \nSupreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because \neducation of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near \nschool yards detracted from students’ education. The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the \ngovernment’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything. \nLopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court. \n \nCongress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided. But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair \ninterstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy \nBrzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players \nat Virginia Tech, had raped her.

After an appeal through the university’s administrative system, Morrison’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n151 \npunishment was set aside, as it was found to be “excessive.” Ultimately, Brzonkala dropped out of the \nuniversity.

Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional.

Distinguish between “discrimination” dormant-commerce-clause cases and “undue burden” dormant-\ncommerce-clause cases. \n \n \nCongress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause and often does legislate. For example, \nCongress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in \nlength. But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and \nlength of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules. States may do so under the so-\ncalled historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government. \nThese police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, \nmorals, and the environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when \nstate action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate. This power is \nclaimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause. \n \nThere are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an \n“undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be \nstruck down. Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 \"Summary and Exercises\", is an example \nof a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on \nits highways.

For \nexample, in Oregon Waste Systems v. Department of Environmental Quality, the state wanted to place a \nslightly higher charge on waste coming from out of state. [2] The state’s reasoning was that in-state \nresidents had already contributed to roads and other infrastructure and that tipping fees at waste facilities \nshould reflect the prior contributions of in-state companies and residents. Out-of-state waste handlers \nwho wanted to use Oregon landfills objected and won their dormant commerce clause claim that Oregon’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n155 \nlaw discriminated “on its face” against interstate commerce. Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything \nthat moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of \nsomething instead of buying something. \n \nThus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing \nthat differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that \noriginate elsewhere. If Michigan were to let counties decide for themselves whether to take garbage from \noutside of the county or not, this could also be a discrimination based on a place of origin outside the \nstate. (Suppose, for instance, each county were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then \nall Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste from outside of Michigan, which is \ndiscriminatory.) [3] \n \nThe Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste requirements that did not differentiate on the \nbasis of origin. If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific hazards, then the law would apply \nequally to in-state and out-of-state garbage. Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could \nstill act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state \nwaste from coming into their own borders.

At the \nbeginning of 1999, the Toronto area was generating about 2.8 million tons of waste annually, \nabout 700,000 tons of which were shipped to Michigan. By early this year, barring unforeseen \ndevelopments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal. \nWhy can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada? They say that after 20 years of searching they \nhave not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage. Ontario has about \n345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles. With six times the land mass, \nthat argument is laughable. \n \nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, for every five years of \ndisposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill \ncapacity. The environmental impacts on landfills, including groundwater contamination, noise \npollution and foul odors, are exacerbated by the significant increase in the use of our landfills \nfrom sources outside of Michigan. \n \nI have teamed up with Senator Stabenow and Congressman Dingell to introduce legislation that \nwould strengthen our ability to stop shipments of waste from Canada. \n \nWe have protections contained in a 17 year-old international agreement between the U.S. and \nCanada called the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste. \nThe U.S. and Canada entered into this agreement in 1986 to allow the shipment of hazardous \nwaste across the U.S./Canadian border for treatment, storage or disposal.

Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that sets standards for \nforeign vessels to enter the navigable waters and ports of the United States.

The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause.

Connecticut (Section 4.6.1), where the Supreme Court struck down a state statute \nforbidding married adults from using, possessing, or distributing contraceptives on the ground that the \nlaw violated the sanctity of the marital relationship. According to Justice Douglas’s plurality opinion, this \npenumbra of privacy, though not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, must be protected to establish \na buffer zone or breathing space for those freedoms that are constitutionally enumerated. \n \nBut substantive due process has seen fairly limited use since the 1930s. During the 1990s, the Supreme \nCourt was asked to recognize a general right to die under the doctrine of substantive due process. \nAlthough the court stopped short of establishing such a far-reaching right, certain patients may exercise a \nconstitutional liberty to hasten their deaths under a narrow set of circumstances. In Cruzan v. Missouri \nDepartment of Health, the Supreme Court ruled that the due process clause guarantees the right of \ncompetent adults to make advanced directives for the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures should they \nbecome incapacitated by a disability that leaves them in a persistent vegetative state. [4] Once it has been \nestablished by clear and convincing evidence that a mentally incompetent and persistently vegetative \npatient made such a prior directive, a spouse, parent, or other appropriate guardian may seek to terminate \nany form of artificial hydration or nutrition. \n \nFourteenth Amendment: Due Process and Equal Protection Guarantees \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n170",

Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954).

Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights. Classifications based on any of these are \nalmost never upheld. \n \nUnder minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues \nare presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen.

A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner \ntest than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to \nsubstantially relate to important government objectives. Increasingly, courts have nullified government \nsex classifications as societal concern with gender equality has grown. (See Shannon Faulkner’s case \nagainst The Citadel, an all-male state school.) [7] \n \nSuppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could \ndrive a taxicab or be a street vendor. That kind of classification would be examined with strict scrutiny to \nsee if there was any compelling justification for it. As noted, classifications such as this one are almost \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n172 \nnever upheld. The law would be upheld only if it were necessary to promote a compelling state interest. \nVery few laws that have a racial or ethnic classification meet that test. \n \nThe strict scrutiny test will be applied to classifications involving racial and ethnic criteria as well as \nclassifications that interfere with a fundamental right. In Palmore v. Sidoti, the state refused to award \ncustody to the mother because her new spouse was racially different from the child. [8]This practice was \ndeclared unconstitutional because the state had made a racial classification; this was presumptively \ninvalid, and the government could not show a compelling need to enforce such a classification through its \nlaw.

It has been \nhis practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; \nto sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use \nsome in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. \n \nHis 1941 wheat acreage allotment was 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He \nsowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under \nthe terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty \nof 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. \n \nThe general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the \nvolume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the \nconsequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce.

Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities \nthrough Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west \ncoast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route. \n \nConsolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks. One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40-foot two-\naxle trailer. This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall. Such trucks have \nlong been used on the Nation’s highways. Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle \ntrailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single-axle trailer. This combination, known \nas a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall. Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, \nincreasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities. Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways. Unlike all \nother States in the West and Midwest, Iowa generally prohibits the use of 65-foot doubles within its \nborders. \n \n… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n180",

Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce \nimposed by Iowa’s law. On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests.",

Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic.

Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded \nthe use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as \nin Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-\nfoot singles. Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western \nStates. Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck. In the absence of \ncongressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must \nbe tolerated. But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its \nregulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state \nlaw cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause. \n \n \n \nA \nIowa made a more serious effort to support the safety rationale of its law than did Wisconsin in Raymond, \nbut its effort was no more persuasive. As noted above, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” The record supports this finding. The trial focused on a \ncomparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories. The evidence \nshowed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in \nthe ability to brake, turn, and maneuver. The double, because of its axle placement, produces less splash \nand spray in wet weather. And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to",

And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to \ndangerous “off-tracking,” and to wind. \n \nNone of these findings is seriously disputed by Iowa. Indeed, the State points to only three ways in which \nthe 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; \nthey may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife. \n \nThe first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways. As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections. The concern over backing \ncapability also is insignificant, because it seldom is necessary to back up on an interstate.

Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than \nsingles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles. \n \nStatistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and \n60-foot doubles. One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative \naccident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles. Each kind of truck was driven 56 million \nmiles on identical routes. The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one \nfatality. The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality.

Alternatively, trucking companies must use \nthe smaller 55-foot singles or 65-foot doubles permitted under Iowa law. Each of these options engenders \ninefficiency and added expense. The record shows that Iowa’s law added about $12.6 million each year to \nthe costs of trucking companies. \n \nConsolidated alone incurred about $2 million per year in increased costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n185 \n \nIn addition to increasing the costs of the trucking companies (and, indirectly, of the service to \nconsumers), Iowa’s law may aggravate, rather than, ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents. Fifty-\nfive-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles. Either more small trucks must be used to carry the \nsame quantity of goods through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks must drive longer distances to \nbypass Iowa. In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be \ndriven to transport the same quantity of goods. Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to \ndistance traveled. Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa’s law tends to increase the \nnumber of accidents and to shift the incidence of them from Iowa to other States. \n \n[IV.

We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The \nrecord demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the \napple trade. [The record] contains numerous affidavits [stating a] preference [for] apples graded under \nthe Washington, as opposed to the USDA, system because of the former’s greater consistency, its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n189 \nemphasis on color, and its supporting mandatory inspections. Once again, the statute had no similar \nimpact on the North Carolina apple industry and thus operated to its benefit. \n \nThird, by prohibiting Washington growers and dealers from marketing apples under their State’s grades, \nthe statute has a leveling effect which insidiously operates to the advantage of local apple producers. \n[With] free market forces at work, Washington sellers would normally enjoy a distinct market advantage \nvis-à-vis local producers in those categories where the Washington grade is superior.

However, because of \nthe statute’s operation, Washington apples which would otherwise qualify for and be sold under the \nsuperior Washington grades will now have to be marketed under their inferior USDA counterparts. Such \n“downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-\nof-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit. At worst, it will have the effect of an \nembargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them \nfrom the North Carolina market. At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that \nsuch apples would otherwise command. \n \nDespite the statute’s facial neutrality, the Commission suggests that its discriminatory impact on \ninterstate commerce was not an unintended by-product, and there are some indications in the record to \nthat effect. The most glaring is the response of the North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner to the \nCommission’s request for an exemption following the statute’s passage in which he indicated that before \nhe could support such an exemption, he would “want to have the sentiment from our apple \nproducers since they were mainly responsible for this legislation being passed.” [Moreover], we find it \nsomewhat suspect that North Carolina singled out only closed containers of apples, the very means by \nwhich apples are transported in commerce, to effectuate the statute’s ostensible consumer protection \npurpose when apples are not generally sold at retail in their shipping containers.

Hillary mentions Senator Clinton by name and \ndepicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator \nClinton.… \nIn December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make Hillary available on a \nvideo-on-demand channel called “Elections ’08.”…Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-\ndemand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for Hillary.

To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1.

Understand how Congress controls administrative agencies. \n3. Understand how the courts can control administrative agencies. \n \n \nDuring the course of the past seventy years, a substantial debate has been conducted, often in shrill \nterms, about the legitimacy of administrative lawmaking. One criticism is that agencies are \n“captured” by the industry they are directed to regulate. Another is that they overregulate, stifling \nindividual initiative and the ability to compete. During the 1960s and 1970s, a massive outpouring of \nfederal law created many new agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones. In the \nlate 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress began to deregulate American society, and \nderegulation increased under the Reagan administration. But the accounting frauds of WorldCom, \nEnron, and others led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown of 2008 has \nled to reregulation of the financial sector. It remains to be seen whether the Deepwater Horizon oil \nblowout of 2010 will lead to more environmental regulations or a rethinking on how to make \nagencies more effective regulators. \n \nAdministrative agencies are the focal point of controversy because they are policy-making bodies, \nincorporating facets of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form that fits uneasily at \nbest in the framework of American government (see Figure 5.1 \"Major Administrative Agencies of the \nUnited States\"). They are necessarily at the center of tugging and hauling by the legislature, the \nexecutive branch, and the judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising political control \nover them. In early 1990, for example, the Bush administration approved a Food and Drug \nAdministration regulation that limited disease-prevention claims by food packagers, reversing a \nposition by the Reagan administration in 1987 permitting such claims. \n \nFigure 5.1 Major Administrative Agencies of the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n214",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision. The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency \nactions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 \"Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review\" on \n“Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAdministrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate.

Understand why the Administrative Procedure Act was needed. \n2. Understand how hearings are conducted under the act. \n3. Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer.

Agencies can affect future conduct far more directly by \nannouncing rules that apply to all who come within the agency’s jurisdiction. \n \nThe acts creating most of the major federal agencies expressly grant them authority to engage in \nrulemaking. This means, in essence, authority to legislate. The outpouring of federal regulations has been \nimmense. The APA directs agencies about to engage in rulemaking to give notice in the \nFederal Register of their intent to do so. The Federal Register is published daily, Monday through \nFriday, in Washington, DC, and contains notice of various actions, including announcements of proposed \nrulemaking and regulations as adopted. The notice must specify the time, place, and nature of the \nrulemaking and offer a description of the proposed rule or the issues involved.

The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an \nunderage patron to the store). Or a junkyard that specializes in automobiles and automobile parts may \nalso be subject to surprise inspections, on the rationale that junkyards are highly likely to be active in the \nresale of stolen autos or stolen auto parts. [3] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n221 \n \nIt is also possible for inspections to take place without a search warrant and without the permission of the \nbusiness. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wished to inspect parts of the Dow \nChemical facility in Midland, Michigan, without the benefit of warrant. When they were refused, agents of \nthe EPA obtained a fairly advanced aerial mapping camera and rented an airplane to fly over the Dow \nfacility. Dow went to court for a restraining order against the EPA and a request to have the EPA turn over \nall photographs taken. But the Supreme Court ruled that the areas photographed were “open fields” and \nnot subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment.

Under the FOIA, any person has a legally enforceable \nright of access to all government documents, with nine specific exceptions, such as classified military \nintelligence, medical files, and trade secrets and commercial or financial information if “obtained from a \nperson and privileged or confidential.” Without the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions,",

The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose.

Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route.

The specialist \ngave him erroneous information over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form that said \nCharles could safely take on the extra work.

According to \nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976), “feasible” means \n“capable of being done, executed, or effected.” In accord, the Oxford English Dictionary 116 (1933) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n235 \n(“Capable of being done, accomplished or carried out”); Funk & Wagnalls New “Standard” Dictionary of \nthe English Language 903 (1957) (“That may be done, performed or effected”). Thus, § 6(b)(5) directs the \nSecretary to issue the standard that “most adequately assures…that no employee will suffer material \nimpairment of health,” limited only by the extent to which this is “capable of being done.” In effect then, \nas the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits, by \nplacing the “benefit” of worker health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this \n“benefit” unachievable. Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that \nstrikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth \nin § 6(b)(5). Thus, cost-benefit analysis by OSHA is not required by the statute because feasibility analysis \nis. \n \nWhen Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such \nintent on the face of the statute.

A traditional \ncriminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal \nversus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we \nwill consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights. \nUnlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes \ninvolve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state \ngovernment). This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be fair, citizens must \nhave clear notice of what is criminally prohibited. Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to \npunish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly \nvague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for \nvagueness.” \n \nWhat is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time.

Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of \n“criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving \nwithout a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society. You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws.

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree).

Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal.",

The receipt need not be personal; if the property is \ndelivered to a place under the control of the receiver, then he is deemed to have received it. “Knowledge” \nis construed broadly: not merely actual knowledge, but (correct) belief and suspicion (strong enough not \nto investigate for fear that the property will turn out to have been stolen) are sufficient for conviction. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n249 \n \nForgery \nForgery is false writing of a document of legal significance (or apparent legal significance!) with intent to \ndefraud.

Documents commonly \nthe subject of forgery are negotiable instruments (checks, money orders, and the like), deeds, receipts, \ncontracts, and bills of lading. The forged instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood. If \nyou fake your neighbor’s signature on one of his checks made out to cash, you have committed forgery. \nBut if you sign a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that there is no money in your \nchecking account, the instrument is not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the intent to \ndefraud. \n \nThe mere making of a forged instrument is unlawful. So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an \ninstrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false signature is \nby no means the only way to commit forgery.

Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation.

Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the \ncrime. \n \n \nTo be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient. But what \nconstitutes an act? This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead? The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison).

This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit. The law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in recent years. The tendency is to hold \nthe corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group \nwithin the corporation (the president or board of directors). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAlthough proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by \ninference (circumstantially).

Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison capsule to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n259 \nswallow. That is the act. If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his \nstate of mind was. Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her, the act was murder. \nWhat if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison but believing that it would only make her \nmildly ill? The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that \nmay cause harm to others. But suppose that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her two \npills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) \nbut that turned out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he had neither intent nor a state of \nknowledge from which intent could be inferred.",

Describe the basic steps in pretrial criminal procedure that follow a government's determination to arrest \nsomeone for an alleged criminal act. \n2. Describe the basic elements of trial and posttrial criminal procedure. \n \n \nThe procedure for criminal prosecutions is complex. Procedures will vary from state to state. A \ncriminal case begins with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing from the scene; if \nthe defendant is not caught, a warrant for the defendant’s arrest will issue. The warrant is issued by a \njudge or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge of a specific crime against the \naccused. It is not enough for a police officer to go before a judge and say, “I’d like you to arrest \nBonnie because I think she’s just murdered Clyde.” She must supply enough information to satisfy \nthe magistrate that there is probable cause (reasonable grounds) to believe that the accused \ncommitted the crime. The warrant will be issued to any officer or agency that has power to arrest the \naccused with warrant in hand. \n \nThe accused will be brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing. The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money.",

In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis. In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of \nwhom is appointed for every federal district. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n263 \nFollowing the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document \nstating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury for \nan indictment. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence. The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment. The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited.

In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff.

Describe the most significant constitutional rights of defendants in US courts, and name the source of \nthese rights. \n2. Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence. \n \n \nSearch and Seizure \nThe rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that \nmake up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.

In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means \nthat the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the \njury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded \nfrom evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession). \nIn Miranda v.

Death was a common punishment for \nrelatively minor crimes. In many places throughout the world, punishments still persist that seem cruel \nand unusual, such as the practice of stoning someone to death. The guillotine, famously in use during and \nafter the French Revolution, is no longer used, nor are defendants put in stocks for public display and \nhumiliation. In pre-Revolutionary America, an unlucky defendant who found himself convicted could face \nbrutal torture before death. \n \nThe Eighth Amendment banned these actions with the words that “cruel and unusual punishments [shall \nnot be] inflicted.” Virtually all such punishments either never were enacted or have been eliminated from \nthe statute books in the United States. Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment has become a source of \ncontroversy, first with the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1976 that the death penalty, as haphazardly applied \nin the various states, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Later Supreme Court opinions have \nmade it easier for states to administer the death penalty. As of 2010, there were 3,300 defendants on \ndeath row in the United States. Of course, no corporation is on death row, and no corporation’s charter \nhas ever been revoked by a US state, even though some corporations have repeatedly been indicted and \nconvicted of criminal offenses.",

In 1960 defendant \nWinifred Mills, his wife, participated in the business generally by answering the telephone, typing, and \nreceiving clients who came to the office. \n \nIn December 1960, Mills showed the complainant, Nathan Pivowar, a house at 1155 Knox Drive and \nanother at 1210 Easy Street, and asked Pivowar if he would loan money on the Knox Drive house. Pivowar \ndid not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction. Later in the same month \nNathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan $5,000 and $4,000 \non the two houses. Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes \nagain. \n \nMills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar. Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office \nMrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation. After the mortgages had been recorded on \nDecember 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for $5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage \nformerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of $3,000. In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two \npersonal notes in the sums of $5,250.00 and $4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan. \n \nAlthough the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did \nnot present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them. In 1962 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n270 \nthe complainant learned that the mortgages which he had taken as security in the transaction were not \nfirst mortgages on the Knox Drive and Easy Street properties. These mortgages actually covered two \nvacant lots on which there were outstanding senior mortgages. On learning this, Pivowar signed a \ncomplaint charging the defendants with the crime of theft by false pretenses. \n \nOn appeal defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the \ninformation. They urge that a permanent taking of property must be proved in order to establish the \ncrime of theft.

Since the complainant had the right to sue on the defendants’ notes, the defendants assert \nthat complainant cannot be said to have been deprived of his property permanently. Defendants \nmisconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses. Stated in a different form, their \nargument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second \nmortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan. \n \nDefendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction. \nRespectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit. A creditor has a \nright to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor. In the former \ncase, he has a right to know about the security. If he extends credit in reliance upon security which is \nfalsely represented to be adequate, he has been defrauded even if the debtor intends to repay the debt. His \nposition is now that of an unsecured creditor. At the very least, an unreasonable risk of loss has been \nforced upon him by reason of the deceit. This risk which he did not intend to assume has been imposed \nupon him by the intentional act of the debtor, and such action constitutes an intent to defraud. \n \n* * * \n \nThe cases cited by defendants in support of their contention are distinguishable from the instant case in \nthat they involved theft by larceny. Since the crime of larceny is designed to protect a person’s possessory \ninterest in property whereas the crime of false pretenses protects one’s title interest, the requirement of a \npermanent deprivation is appropriate to the former. Accordingly, we hold that an intent to repay a loan \nobtained on the basis of a false representation of the security for the loan is no defense. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n271 \n \n* * * \n \nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished).

Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.

Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

The court found that the \nbehavior of the collection company’s two agents was sufficiently outrageous to prove the tort of \nintentional infliction of emotional distress. In Roche v. Stern (New York), the famous cable television talk \nshow host Howard Stern had tastelessly discussed the remains of Deborah Roche, a topless dancer and \ncable access television host. [1] The remains had been brought to Stern’s show by a close friend of Roche, \nChaunce Hayden, and a number of crude comments by Stern and Hayden about the remains were \nvideotaped and broadcast on a national cable television station. Roche’s sister and brother sued Howard \nStern and Infinity broadcasting and were able to get past the defendant’s motion to dismiss to have a jury \nconsider their claim. \nA plaintiff’s burden in these cases is to show that the mental distress is severe. Many states require that \nthis distress must result in physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, ulcers, or, as in the case of the \npregnant wife, a miscarriage. Other states have not required physical symptoms, finding that shame, \nembarrassment, fear, and anger constitute severe mental distress. \n \nTrespass and Nuisance \nTrespass is intentionally going on land that belongs to someone else or putting something on someone \nelse’s property and refusing to remove it.

The \nspring could not be seen from the outside, and no warning of its presence was posted. \n \nThe plaintiff, Katko, had been hunting in the area for several years and considered the property \nabandoned. He knew it had long been uninhabited. He and a friend had been to the house and found \nseveral old bottles and fruit jars that they took and added to their collection of antiques. When they made \na second trip to the property, they entered by removing a board from a porch window. When the plaintiff \nopened the north bedroom door, the shotgun went off and struck him in the right leg above the ankle \nbone. Much of his leg was blown away. While Katko knew he had no right to break and enter the house \nwith intent to steal bottles and fruit jars, the court held that a property owner could not protect an \nunoccupied boarded-up farmhouse by using a spring gun capable of inflicting death or serious injury. \n \nIn Katko, there is an intentional tort.

The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation.

Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A \nstatement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major \nnetwork weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show \nthat the words were aimed at them. But statements about large groups will not support an action for \ndefamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor). \nThe law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That a person did not intend to defame is \nordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, \nmagazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due care \nis usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel \ncannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else. Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel.

Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment. The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any \nstatements made in connection with legislative business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third \nperson, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the \nwarning, even though false. Likewise, an employee may warn an employer about the conduct or character \nof a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence \nor conduct of a child’s teacher.

This can include statements that are intended to mislead consumers about the quality, safety, or effectiveness of a product, or statements that are intended to damage the reputation of a competitor. The tort of product disparagement is a form of defamation, and can result in legal action being taken against the person or entity responsible for making the false or misleading statements."

This privilege is typically granted to statements made in the course of judicial proceedings, such as testimony in court or statements made by witnesses. Qualified privilege, on the other hand, refers to a legal doctrine that protects certain statements from being considered defamatory if they are made in good faith and for a legitimate purpose. This privilege is typically granted to statements made by individuals in the course of their official duties, such as statements made by government officials or statements made by employees in the course of their employment. The key difference between absolute and qualified privilege is that absolute privilege protects statements regardless of whether they are true or false, while qualified privilege only protects statements that are made in good faith and for a legitimate purpose."

Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot?

If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed \nan unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most \ninstances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do. The reasonable man stops for \ntraffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs \nsurgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of \nhis grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions \nto avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The \"reasonable man\" standard imposes hindsight \non the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may \nsometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable. \n \nDuty of Care and Its Breach \nThe law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person. If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in \nthis interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might \nsubject us to liability for its effect on someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the \nnumber of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful. \n \nIn general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the \ndrowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase.

And users who were not immediate purchasers were said \nnot to be in privity with a supplier or manufacturer. In 1916, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, then on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n300 \nNew York Court of Appeals, penned an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of privity, \nthough it would take half a century before the last state—Mississippi in 1966—would fall in line. \nDetermining a duty of care can be a vexing problem. Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of \nmedical ethics to respect the confidences of their patients. Suppose a patient tells a psychiatrist that he \nintends to kill his girlfriend. Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn prospective victim? \nThe California Supreme Court has said yes.

Under the rule of privity, only the parties who are directly involved in a contract can enforce its terms. This means that third parties who are not parties to the contract cannot enforce its terms or seek damages for breach of contract. The rule of privity is based on the principle that a contract is a private agreement between two parties, and that third parties have no legal rights or obligations under the contract. The rule of privity is often used as a defense in contract disputes, where a party seeks to enforce the terms of a contract against a third party who was not a party to the contract. The rule of privity is also used to limit the scope of liability in tort law, where a plaintiff seeks to hold a defendant liable for damages caused by the defendant's negligence. In tort law, the rule of privity is used to limit the scope of liability to the parties who are directly involved in the tort, and to exclude third parties who are not directly involved from liability. The rule of privity is a common law doctrine that has been adopted by many jurisdictions, but it is not universally accepted. Some jurisdictions have adopted a more liberal approach to the rule of privity, allowing third parties to enforce the terms of a contract or to seek damages for breach of contract.

Factual \nissues are for the jury to resolve.

Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no \none saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly \nconclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference \nof negligence. A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of \nnegligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, \nand the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the \nmanagement use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the \ndefendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] \n \nIf a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane \ncrashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the \ndefendants, that there was negligence.

Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most of the fault being chargeable to \nthe defendant, the court would dismiss the suit if the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to his injury. In a few \nstates today, this rule of contributory negligence is still in effect. Although referred to as negligence, \nthe rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which the defendant is charged, because the \nplaintiff’s only error in such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have been, whereas the \ndefendant is charged with conduct careless toward others. This rule was so manifestly unjust in many \ncases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version \nof comparative negligence. Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned \naccording to the defendant’s degree of culpability. For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages. \n \nAssumption of Risk",

The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she \nmust suffer the consequences. \n \nThe assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways. The plaintiff may have formally agreed with the \ndefendant before entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of liability should injury \noccur. (“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I \nhaven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the \ndefendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is \nhit by a line drive in a ballpark).

The argument in essence is that a duty should spring from the University’s natural interest \nin the welfare and safety of its students, its superior knowledge of the nature and degree of risk involved \nin trampoline use, and its knowledge of the use of trampolines on the University campus. The evidence \namply supports a conclusion that trampoline use involves risks of serious injuries and that the potential \nfor an injury such as that experienced by Whitlock was foreseeable. It shows further that prior injuries \nresulting from trampoline accidents had been reported to campus security and to the student clinic, and \nthat University administrators were aware of the number and severity of trampoline injuries nationwide. \n \nThe record, however, also establishes through Whitlock’s own testimony that he was aware of the risk of \nan accident and injury of the very nature that he experienced.… \n \nWe conclude that the relationship between the University and Whitlock was not one of dependence with \nrespect to the activities at issue here, and provides no basis for the recognition of a duty of the University \nto take measures for protection of Whitlock against the injury that he suffered. \n \nB. \nWe next examine the lease between the University and the fraternity to determine whether a special \nrelationship between the University and Whitlock can be predicated on that document.

A tort can also be a strict liability tort, which means that the defendant is liable for the harm caused even if they were not negligent. Torts can be either public or private. Public torts are those that harm the public at large, such as pollution or nuisance. Private torts are those that harm an individual or group of individuals, such as defamation or invasion of privacy. Torts can be either intentional or unintentional.

Long Island R.R. \n248 N.Y. 339,162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928) \n \nCARDOZO, Chief Judge \n \nPlaintiff was standing on a platform of defendant’s railroad after buying a ticket to go to Rockaway Beach. \nA train stopped at the station, bound for another place. Two men ran forward to catch it. One of the men \nreached the platform of the car without mishap, though the train was already moving. The other man, \ncarrying a package, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as if about to fall. A guard on the car, \nwho had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed \nhim from behind. In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails. It was a package of small \nsize, about fifteen inches long, and was covered by a newspaper. In fact it contained fireworks, but there \nwas nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents. The fireworks when they fell exploded. The \nshock of· the explosion threw down some scales at the other end of the platform many feet away. The \nscales struck the plaintiff, causing injuries for which she sues. \n \nThe conduct of the defendant’s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a \nwrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. \nNothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus \nremoved. Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the \nviolation of a right. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.…If no hazard was apparent to \nthe eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to \nher, did not take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong, though apparently not \none involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with reference to someone else.…The plaintiff sues in her own \nright for a wrong personal to her, and not as the vicarious beneficiary of a breach of duty to another. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n321",

Life will have to be made over, and human nature \ntransformed, before prevision so extravagant can be accepted as the norm of conduct, the customary \nstandard to which behavior must conform. \n \nThe argument for the plaintiff is built upon the shifting meanings of such words as “wrong” and \n“wrongful” and shares their instability. For what the plaintiff must show is a “wrong” to herself; i.e., a \nviolation of her own right, and not merely a “wrong” to someone else, nor conduct “wrongful” because \nunsocial, but not a “wrong” to anyone.

The parties create contract duties through a bargaining process. The \nkey element in the process is control; individuals are in control of a situation because they have the \nfreedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship. Tort duties, in contrast, are \nobligations the law imposes. Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an \nunderstanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.1 General Perspectives on Contracts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

In common parlance, the term is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n329 \nused interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies \nour notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor.

Thus the status of the Slave has \ndisappeared—it has been superseded by the contractual relation of the servant to his master. . . . \nThe status of the Female under Tutelage . . . has also ceased to exist. . . .

Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law.

The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of \ngoods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only \nincidentally used, with Newmark v.

For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car.

Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you. \nA voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing.

(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES",

That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard. The Restatement (Second) of \nContracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n342 \nanother.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their \nlanguage or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or \ncourse of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what \nthey thought they said or did. \n \nThe distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims \nhe spoke in jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment.

The court disagreed, \nholding that it was reasonable to interpret the pledge of $100,000 as a means of promoting punchboards: \n \n(I)f the jest is not apparent and a reasonable hearer would believe that an offer was being made, \nthen the speaker risks the formation of a contract which was not intended.

The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor. Whether \nconsideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to \nmake the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment. (Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the \npromisor is sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did \nthe promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise? Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting.

For centuries, however, a large exception has \ngrown up around the Statute of Frauds, first enacted in England in 1677 under the formal name “An \nAct for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries.” The purpose of the Statute of Frauds is to prevent the \nfraud that occurs when one party attempts to impose upon another a contract that did not in fact exist. \nThe two sections dealing with contracts read as follows: \n[Sect. 4] ...no action shall be brought whereby to charge any executor or administrator upon any \nspecial promise, to answer damages out of his own estate; (2) or whereby to charge the \ndefendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another \nperson; (3) or to charge any person upon any agreement made upon consideration of marriage; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n348 \n(4) or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest in or \nconcerning them; (5) or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one \nyear from the making thereof; (6) unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, \nor some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged \ntherewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. \n \n[Sect. 17] ...no contract for the sale of any goods, wares and merchandizes, for the price of ten \npounds sterling or upwards, shall be allowed to be good, except the buyer shall accept part of the \ngoods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or \nin part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be made \nand signed by the parties to be charged by such contract, or their agents thereunto lawfully \nauthorized. \n \nAgain, as may be evident from the title of the act and its language, the general purpose of the law is to \nprovide evidence, in areas of some complexity and importance, that a contract was actually made. To a \nlesser degree, the law serves to caution those about to enter a contract and “to create a climate in which \nparties often regard their agreements as tentative until there is a signed writing.” (Restatement (Second) \nof Contracts Chapter 5, statutory note) \n \nThe Statute of Frauds has been enacted in form similar to the seventeenth century act in most states. \nHowever, in the twentieth century Section 7 was been replaced by a section Uniform Commercial Code.",

Still, although there are \nnumerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out \ntheir contracts, the courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous \nline that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it.” By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the \npromisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, \nthough not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an \nincentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay. The purpose of \ncontract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to \nput the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach. \n \nCompensatory Damages \nOne party has the right to damages (money ) when the other party has breached the contract unless, of \ncourse, the contract itself or other circumstances suspend or discharge that \nright. Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester.

But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages. When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n352 \nprice as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in \nthe event of breach. \n \nIncidental Damages \nSuppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search.

No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents.

A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature. He is said to \nhave been the first person from the Mayflower to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620; he was a carpenter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n372 \na cooper (barrel maker), and a diplomat.

Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady.

These relationships can be summed up in a simple \ndiagram (see Figure 9.1 \"Agency Relationships\"). \n \nFigure 9.1 Agency Relationships \n \n \nIn this chapter, we will consider the principal-agent side of the triangle. In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer",

Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant.

But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees.

Thus a mentally incompetent agent cannot bind a principal. \n \nAgency Created by Operation of Law \nMost agencies are made by contract, but agency also may arise impliedly or apparently. \n \nImplied Agency \nIn areas of social need, courts have declared an agency to exist in the absence of an agreement. The agency \nrelationship then is said to have been implied “by operation of law.” Children in most states may purchase \nnecessary items—food or medical services—on the parent’s account. Long-standing social policy deems it \ndesirable for the head of a family to support his dependents, and the courts will put the expense on the \nfamily head in order to provide for the dependents’ welfare. The courts achieve this result by supposing \nthe dependent to be the family head’s agent, thus allowing creditors to sue the family head for the debt. \n \nImplied agencies also arise where one person behaves as an agent would and the “principal,” knowing that \nthe “agent” is behaving so, acquiesces, allowing the person to hold himself out as an agent.

Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause \nin the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several \naspects. \n \nDuty to Avoid Self-Dealing \nA fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his \nprincipal’s interest in that same transaction. A broker hired as a purchasing agent, for instance, may not \nsell to his principal through a company in which he or his family has a financial interest.

This doctrine is based on the idea that the employer has invested time, materials, and resources in the employee's work, and therefore has a right to the results of that work. The shop rights doctrine is often used in cases where an employee has developed a new product or process while working for a company, and the company wants to use that invention without having to pay the employee for it. The doctrine is controversial, as it can be seen as unfair to the employee, who may have put in a lot of effort and creativity into developing the invention, but is not being compensated for it. However, the doctrine is also seen as a way to encourage innovation and creativity in the workplace, as it allows employers to take advantage of the ideas and inventions of their employees without having to pay for them."

An implied contract, on the other hand, is a contract that is formed when the parties involved have an understanding of the terms of the contract, but have not explicitly agreed to them in writing or verbally. Implied contracts are often formed when one party provides a service or product to another party, and the other party accepts the service or product without any explicit agreement. For example, if a customer goes to a restaurant and orders a meal, the customer is impliedly agreeing to pay for the meal, even though there is no explicit agreement between the customer and the restaurant. Implied contracts are often used in situations where the parties involved have a long-standing relationship, and the terms of the contract are understood by both parties. However, implied contracts can be more difficult to enforce than express contracts, as they are based on the understanding of the parties involved, rather than an explicit agreement."

The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent? \n4.

After certifying the named plaintiffs as representatives of a class of “common-law \nemployees,” the district court granted summary judgment to Microsoft on all counts. The \nplaintiffs…now appeal as to two of their claims: a) the claim…that they are entitled to savings benefits \nunder Microsoft’s Savings Plus Plan (SPP); and b) that…they are entitled to stock-option benefits under \nMicrosoft’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). In both cases, the claims are based on their \ncontention that they are common-law employees. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n399 \nMicrosoft, one of the country’s fastest growing and most successful corporations and the world’s largest \nsoftware company, produces and sells computer software internationally.

The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status. Indeed, Microsoft has pointed to no \nevidence suggesting that it ever denied eligibility to any employees, whom it understood to be common-\nlaw employees, by paying them through the accounts receivable department or otherwise. \n \nWe therefore construe the ambiguity in the plan against Microsoft and hold that the plaintiffs are eligible \nto participate under the terms of the SPP. \n \n[Next, regarding the ESPP] we hold that the plaintiffs…are covered by the specific provisions of the ESPP. \nWe apply the “objective manifestation theory of contracts,” which requires us to “impute an intention \ncorresponding to the reasonable meaning of a person’s words and acts.” [Citation] Through its \nincorporation of the tax code provision into the plan, Microsoft manifested an objective intent to make all \ncommon-law employees, and hence the plaintiffs, eligible for participation.

(emphasis added) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n402 \n \n[T]he ESPP, when construed in a manner consistent with the requirements of § 423, extends participation \nto all common-law employees not covered by one of the express exceptions set forth in the plan. \nAccordingly, we find that the ESPP, through its incorporation of § 423, expressly extends eligibility for \nparticipation to the plaintiff class and affords them the same options to acquire stock in the corporation as \nall other employees. \n \nMicrosoft next contends that the [employment agreements] signed by the plaintiffs render them ineligible \nto participate in the ESPP. First, the label used in the instruments signed by the plaintiffs does not control \ntheir employment status. Second, the employment instruments, if construed to exclude the plaintiffs from \nreceiving ESPP benefits, would conflict with the plan’s express incorporation of § 423. Although Microsoft \nmay have generally intended to exclude individuals who were in fact independent contractors, it could \nnot, consistent with its express intention to extend participation in the ESPP to all common-law \nemployees, have excluded the plaintiffs.

There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights. It is “well established” that an optionor may not rely on an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n403 \noptionee’s failure to exercise an option when he has committed any act or failed to perform any duty \n“calculated to cause the optionee to delay in exercising the right.” [Citation] “[T]he optionor may not \nmake statements or representations calculated to cause delay, [or] fail to furnish [necessary] \ninformation.…” Similarly, “[I]t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause \nof the failure of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own \nliability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.” [Citation]… \n \nApplying these principles, we agree with the magistrate judge, who concluded that Microsoft, which \ncreated a benefit to which the plaintiffs were entitled, could not defend itself by arguing that the plaintiffs \nwere unaware of the benefit, when its own false representations precluded them from gaining that \nknowledge. Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer. It may not now take advantage of that failure to defeat the plaintiffs’ rights to ESPP \nbenefits.

It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays.

She was again discharged and, in mid-January, 1972, \nresumed her employment with Sibley, Lindsay & Curr. \nMrs. Wolfe’s claim for workmen’s compensation was granted by the referee and affirmed by the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Board.

We do not agree with this conclusion. \n \nWorkmen’s compensation, as distinguished from tort liability which is essentially based on fault, is \ndesigned to shift the risk of loss of earning capacity caused by industrial accidents from the worker to \nindustry and ultimately the consumer. In light of its beneficial and remedial character the Workmen’s \nCompensation Law should be construed liberally in favor of the employee [Citation]. \n \nLiability under the act is predicated on accidental injury arising out of and in the course of \nemployment.…Applying these concepts to the case at bar we note that there is no issue raised concerning \nthe causal relationship between the occurrence and the injury. The only testimony on this matter was \ngiven by Dr. Grinols who stated unequivocally that the discovery of her superior’s body was the competent \nproducing cause of her condition. Nor is there any question as to the absence of physical impact. \nAccordingly, the focus of our inquiry is whether or not there has been an accidental injury within the \nmeaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Law. \n \nSince there is no statutory definition of this term we turn to the relevant decisions. These may be divided \ninto three categories: (1) psychic trauma which produces physical injury, (2) physical impact which",

Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority",

If express authority were the only valid kind, there would be no efficient way to use an agent, \nboth because the effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the third party would be \nreluctant to deal with him. \nBut the law permits authority to be “implied” by the relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of \nthe business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question, the wording of the agency contract, and \nthe knowledge that the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it. In \neither event, the business manager has a relatively large domain of implied authority. He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business.

In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a \nnew logo for the hotel’s stationery.

Describe the principal’s liability for crimes committed by the agent. \n \n \n \nPrincipal’s Tort Liability \nThe Distinction between Direct and Vicarious Liability \nWhen is the principal liable for injuries that the agent causes another to suffer? \n \nDirect Liability \nThere is a distinction between torts prompted by the principal himself and torts of which the principal \nwas innocent. If the principal directed the agent to commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the \nagent’s carrying out his instructions would bring harm to someone, the principal is liable. This is an \napplication of the general common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by delegating an \nunlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls \nthe trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in his use of agents will be held liable for their \nnegligence. This rule comes into play when the principal fails to supervise employees adequately, gives \nfaulty directions, or hires incompetent or unsuitable people for a particular job. Imposing liability on the \nprincipal in these cases is readily justifiable since it is the principal’s own conduct that is the underlying \nfault; the principal here is directly liable. \n \nVicarious Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n424 \nBut the principle of liability for one’s agent is much broader, extending to acts of which the principal had \nno knowledge, that he had no intention to commit nor involvement in, and that he may in fact have \nexpressly prohibited the agent from engaging in. This is the principle of respondeat superior (“let the \nmaster answer”) or the master-servant doctrine, which imposes on the \nprincipal vicarious liability (vicarious means “indirectly, as, by, or through a substitute”) under which \nthe principal is responsible for acts committed by the agent within the scope of the employment \n(see Figure 10.2 \"Principal’s Tort Liability\"). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10.2 Principal’s Tort Liability \n \n \nThe modern basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed the “deep pocket” theory: the principal \n(usually a corporation) has deeper pockets than the agent, meaning that it has the wherewithal to pay for",

A million-dollar industrial accident is \nwithin the means of a company or its insurer; it is usually not within the means of the agent—employee—\nwho caused it. \n \nThe “deep pocket” of the defendant-company is not always very deep, however. For many small \nbusinesses, in fact, the principle of respondeat superior is one of life or death. One example was the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n425 \nclosing in San Francisco of the much-beloved Larraburu Brothers Bakery—at the time, the world’s second \nlargest sourdough bread maker. The bakery was held liable for $2 million in damages after one of its \ndelivery trucks injured a six-year-old boy. The bakery’s insurance policy had a limit of $1.25 million, and \nthe bakery could not absorb the excess. The Larraburus had no choice but to cease operations. \n(Seehttp://www.outsidelands.org/larraburu.php.) \n \nRespondeat superior raises three difficult questions: (1) What type of agents can create tort liability for \nthe principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors. The plumber who rushes to a client’s house to repair a leak and causes a traffic accident does \nnot subject the homeowner to liability. But there are exceptions to the rule.

By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for \nvicarious liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be, doing—more or less—what she is \nsupposed to be doing, and the incident arose from the employee’s pursuit of the employer’s interest \n(again, more or less).

However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers.

It \nalso makes sense that—as is the general rule—an agent is not liable on contracts she makes on the \nprincipal’s behalf; the agent is not a party to a contract made by the agent on behalf of the principal. No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.)

A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high.

Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal. Who may enforce the contracts against them? \n \nThe developer and the agents may sue to compel transfer of title. The undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal may act to enforce his rights unless the contract specifically prohibits it or there is a \nrepresentation that the signatories are not signing for an undisclosed principal. The agents may also bring \nsuit to enforce the principal’s contract rights because, as agents for an undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal, they are considered parties to their contracts. \n \nNow suppose the developer attempts to call off the deal. Whom may the sellers sue? Both the developer \nand the agents are liable. That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there \nwas a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may \nstill recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior \nto winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the \nplaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway. Similarly, if the \nseller sues the principal and recovers a judgment, the agents are relieved of liability. The seller thus has a \n“right of election” to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, a right that in many states may be \nexercised any time before the seller collects on the judgment. \n \n \nLack of Authority in Agent \nAn agent who purports to make a contract on behalf of a principal, but who in fact has no authority to do \nso, is liable to the other party.

Brown. The aggregate loans made by the Bank to \nKanavos at any given time went as high as $800,000. \n \nOver that same decade, Brown’s responsibilities at the Bank grew, and he had become executive vice-\npresident. Brown was also the chief loan officer for the Bank, which had fourteen or fifteen branches in \naddition to its head office. Physically, Brown’s office was at the head office, toward the rear of the main \nbanking floor, opposite the office of the president—whose name was Kelley. Often Brown would tell \nKanavos that he had to check an aspect of a loan transaction with Kelley, but Kelley always backed Brown \nup on those occasions. \n… \n[The plaintiff, Harold Kanavos, entered into an agreement with the defendant Bank whereby stock owned \nby the Kanavos brothers was sold to the Bank and the plaintiff was given an option to repurchase the \nstock. Kanavos’ suit against the Bank was based on an amendment to the agreement offered by Brown.] \n \nKanavos was never permitted to introduce in evidence the terms of the offer Brown made. That offer was \ncontained in a writing, dated July 16, 1976, on bank letterhead, which read as follows: “This letter is to \nconfirm our conversation regarding your option to re-purchase the subject property. In lieu of your not \nexercising your option, we agree to pay you $40,000 representing a commission upon our sale of the \nsubject property, and in addition, will give you the option to match the price of sale of said property to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n439 \nextend for a 60 day period from the time our offer is received.” Brown signed the letter as executive vice-\npresident.

Whether Brown had apparent authority to make the July 16, 1976, modification is \na question of how, in the circumstances, a third person, e.g., a customer of the Bank such as Kanavos, \nwould reasonably interpret Brown’s authority in light of the manifestations of his principal, the Bank. \n \nTitles of office generally do not establish apparent authority.

In Costonis v. Medford Housing \nAuthy.…(1961), the executive director of a public housing authority was held to have apparent authority to \nvary specifications on the basis of the cumulative effect of what he had done and what the authority \nappeared to permit him to do. \n \nIn the instant case there was evidence of the following variety of circumstances: Brown’s title of executive \nvice-president; the location of his office opposite the president; his frequent communications with the \npresident; the long course of dealing and negotiations; the encouragement of Kanavos by the president to \ndeal with Brown; the earlier amendment of the agreement by Brown on behalf of the Bank on material \npoints, namely the price to be paid by the Bank for the shares and the repurchase price; the size of the",

Officer James then transported Cockrell to the Reservoir Patrol office \nand administered an intoxilyzer test. The results of the test are not before us; however, we do know that \nafter the test was administered, Officer James apologized to Cockrell for arresting her, and he assured her \nthat he would prepare her paperwork so that she would not have to spend much time in jail. As they were \nleaving the Reservoir Patrol office, Officer James began asking Cockrell personal questions such as where \nshe lived, whether she was dating anyone and if she had a boyfriend. Officer James then asked Cockrell \nfor her cell phone number so that he could call and check on her. As they were approaching his patrol car \nfor the trip to the Rankin County jail, Officer James informed Cockrell that she should be wearing \nhandcuffs; however, he did not handcuff Cockrell, and he allowed her to ride in the front seat of the patrol \ncar with him. In route to the jail, Cockrell became emotional and started crying. As she was fixing her \nmakeup using the mirror on the sun visor, Officer James pulled his patrol car into a church parking lot \nand parked the car. He then pulled Cockrell towards him in an embrace and began stroking her back and \nhair telling her that things would be fine. Cockrell told Officer James to release her, but he continued to \nembrace her for approximately five minutes before continuing on to the jail. \n \nOn June 30, 1998, Cockrell returned to the Reservoir Patrol office to retrieve her driver’s license. Officer \nJames called Cockrell into his office and discussed her DUI charge with her. As she was leaving, Officer \nJames grabbed her from behind, turned her around, pinned both of her arms behind her and pulled her to \nhis chest. When Officer James bent down to kiss her, she ducked her head, thus causing Officer James to \ninstead kiss her forehead.

Three types of authority \nmay bind the principal: (1) express authority—that which is actually given and spelled out, (2) implied \nauthority—that which may fairly be inferred from the parties’ relationship and which is incidental to the \nagent’s express authority, and (3) apparent authority—that which reasonably appears to a third party \nunder the circumstances to have been given by the principal. Even in the absence of authority, a principal \nmay ratify the agent’s acts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n452 \nThe principal may be liable for tortious acts of the agent but except under certain regulatory statutes may \nnot be held criminally liable for criminal acts of agents not prompted by the principal. Under the doctrine \nof respondeat superior, a principal is generally liable for acts by a servant within the scope of employment. \nA principal usually will not be held liable for acts of nonservant agents that cause physical damage, \nalthough he will be held liable for nonphysical torts, such as misrepresentation. The principal will not be \nheld liable for tortious acts of independent contractors, although the principal may be liable for injuries \nresulting from his failure to act in situations in which he was not legally permitted to delegate a duty to \nact. Whenever an agent is acting to further the principal’s business interests, the principal will be held \nvicariously liable for the agent’s intentional torts. What constitutes scope of employment is not easy to \ndetermine; the modern trend is to hold a principal liable for the conduct of an agent if it was foreseeable \nthat the agent might act as he did. \n \nMost states have special rules of vicarious liability for special situations; for example, liability of an \nautomobile owner for use by another. Spouses are not vicariously liable for each other, nor are parents for \nchildren, except for failing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nIn general, an agent is not personally liable on contracts he has signed on behalf of a principal. This \ngeneral rule has several exceptions recognized in most states: (1) when the agent is serving an undisclosed \nor partially disclosed principal, (2) when the agent lacks authority or exceeds his authority, and (3) if the \nagent entered into the contract in a personal capacity.",

Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order.

An amended UPA appeared in 1992, and \nfurther amendments were promulgated in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. The NCCUL reports that thirty-\nnine states have adopted some version of the revised act. This chapter will discuss the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) as promulgated in 1997, but because not all jurisdictions have not adopted it, \nwhere RUPA makes significant changes, the original 1914 UPA will also be considered. [2] The NCCUL \nobserves in its “prefatory note” to the 1997 act: “The Revised Act is largely a series of ‘default rules’ that \ngovern the relations among partners in situations they have not addressed in a partnership agreement. \nThe primary focus of RUPA is the small, often informal, partnership. Larger partnerships generally have a \npartnership agreement addressing, and often modifying, many of the provisions of the partnership act.” [3] \n \nEntity Theory \nMeaning of “Legal Entity” \nA significant difference between a partnership and most other kinds of business organization relates to \nwhether, and the extent to which, the business is a legal entity. A legal entity is a person or group that the \nlaw recognizes as having legal rights, such as the right to own and dispose of property, to sue and be sued, \nand to enter into contracts; the entity theory is the concept of a business firm as a legal person, with \nexistence and accountability separate from its owners. When individuals carry out a common enterprise \nas partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said \nno. In other words, under the common-law theory, a partnership was but a convenient name for an \naggregate of individuals, and the rights and duties recognized and imposed by law are those of the \nindividual partners. By contrast, the mercantile theory of the law merchant held that a partnership is a \nlegal entity that can have rights and duties independent of those of its members. \n \nDuring the drafting of the 1914 UPA, a debate raged over which theory to adopt. The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460",

The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460 \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit”) and retained the \ncommon-law theory that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals—the aggregate theory. \n \nRUPA moved more toward making partnerships entities. According to the NCCUL, “The Revised Act \nenhances the entity treatment of partnerships to achieve simplicity for state law purposes, particularly in \nmatters concerning title to partnership property. RUPA does not, however, relentlessly apply the entity \napproach. The aggregate approach is retained for some purposes, such as partners’ joint and several \nliability.” [4] Section 201(a) provides, “A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.” [5] \nEntity Characteristics of a Partnership \nUnder RUPA, then, a partnership has entity characteristics, but the partners remain guarantors of \npartnership obligations, as always—that is the partners’ joint and several liability noted in the previous \nparagraph (and discussed further in Chapter 12 \"Partnership Operation and Termination\"). This is a very \nimportant point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them \nis, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes \npersonal and unlimited liability. This personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished, \nsubject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and limited liability companies, as discussed \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\".

Similarly, to sue a partnership, the plaintiff must name and sue each of the \npartners. This cumbersome procedure was modified in many states, which enacted special statutes \nexpressly permitting suits by and against partnerships in the firm name. In suits on a claim in federal \ncourt, a partnership may sue and be sued in its common name. The move by RUPA to make partnerships \nentities changed very little. Certainly it provides that “a partnership may sue and be sued in the name of \nthe partnership”—that’s handy where the plaintiff hopes for a judgment against the partnership, without \nrecourse to the individual partners’ personal assets. [6] But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and \nthe partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment \nagainst a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating \nthat partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in \npartnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership. [8] Under RUPA, \n“property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.” [9] But RUPA \nis no different from UPA in practical effect.

For example, Carlos decides to paint houses during his summer break. He gathers some \nmaterials and gets several jobs. He hires Wally as a helper. Wally is very good, and pretty soon both of \nthem are deciding what jobs to do and how much to charge, and they are splitting the profits. They have \nan implied partnership, without intending to create a partnership at all. \n \nTests of Partnership Existence \nBut how do we know whether an implied partnership has been created? Obviously, we know if there is an \nexpress agreement. But partnerships can come into existence quite informally, indeed, without any \nformality—they can be created accidentally. In contrast to the corporation, which is the creature of \nstatute, partnership is a catchall term for a large variety of working relationships, and frequently, \nuncertainties arise about whether or not a particular relationship is that of partnership. The law can \nreduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price of severely restricting the flexibility of people to \nassociate. As the chief drafter of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA, 1914) explained, \n \nAll other business associations are statutory in origin. They are formed by the happening of an \nevent designated in a statute as necessary to their formation. In corporations this act may be the \nissuing of a charter by the proper officer of the state; in limited partnerships, the filing by the \nassociates of a specified document in a public office. On the other hand, an infinite number of \ncombinations of circumstances may result in co-ownership of a business. Partnership is the \nresiduum, including all forms of co-ownership, of a business except those business associations \norganized under a specific statute.

We \nreturn to the definition of a partnership: “the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners \na business for profit[.]” The three elements are (1) the association of persons, (2) as co-owners, (3) for \nprofit. \n \nAssociation of Persons \nThis element is pretty obvious. A partnership is a contractual agreement among persons, so the persons \ninvolved need to have capacity to contract. But RUPA does not provide that only natural persons can be \npartners; it defines person as follows: “‘Person’ means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, \ntrust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or \ninstrumentality, or any other legal or commercial entity.” [3] Thus unless state law precludes it, a \ncorporation can be a partner in a partnership. The same is true under UPA. \n \nCo-owners of a Business \nIf what two or more people own is clearly a business—including capital assets, contracts with employees \nor agents, an income stream, and debts incurred on behalf of the operation—a partnership exists. A \ntougher question arises when two or more persons co-own property. Do they automatically become \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n468 \npartners? The answer can be important: if one of the owners while doing business pertinent to the \nproperty injures a stranger, the latter could sue the other owners if there is a partnership. \n \nCo-ownership comes in many guises. The four most common are joint tenancy, tenancy in common, \ntenancy by the entireties, and community property. In joint tenancy, the owners hold the property under a \nsingle instrument, such as a deed, and if one dies, the others automatically become owners of the \ndeceased’s share, which does not descend to his heirs. Tenancy in common has the reverse rule: the \nsurvivor tenants do not take the deceased’s share. Each tenant in common has a distinct estate in the \nproperty. The tenancy by the entirety and community property (in community-property states) forms of \nownership are limited to spouses, and their effects are similar to that of joint tenancy. \n \nSuppose a husband and wife who own their home as tenants by the entirety (or community property)",

The paucity of coherent law \ngoverning these organizations gave rise in 2005 to the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform \nLaws’ promulgation of the Revised Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (RUUNAA). The \nprefatory note to this act says, “RUUNAA was drafted with small informal associations in mind. These \ninformal organizations are likely to have no legal advice and so fail to consider legal and organizational \nquestions, including whether to incorporate.

In essence, a \njoint venture is a “temporary partnership.” In the United States, the use of joint ventures began with the railroads \nin the late 1800s. Throughout the middle part of the twentieth century joint ventures were common in the \nmanufacturing sector. By the late 1980s, they increasingly appeared in both manufacturing and service industries \nas businesses looked for new, competitive strategies. They are aggressively promoted on the Internet: “Joint \nVentures are in, and if you’re not utilizing this strategic weapon, chances are your competition is, or will soon be, \nusing this to their advantage.…possibly against you!” (Scott Allen, “Joint Venturing 101,” About.com \nEntrepreneurs,http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/beyondstartup/a/jointventures.htm).As a risk-avoiding device, \nthe joint venture allows two or more firms to pool their differing expertise so that neither needs to “learn the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n472 \nropes” from the beginning; neither needs the entire capital to start the enterprise.

Joint venturers are fiduciaries toward one another. \nAlthough no formality is necessary, the associates will usually sign an agreement. The joint venture need have no \ngroup name, though it may have one. Property may be owned jointly. Profits and losses will be shared, as in a \npartnership, and each associate has the right to participate in management. Liability is unlimited. Sometimes two \nor more businesses will form a joint venture to carry out a specific task—prospecting for oil, building a nuclear \nreactor, doing basic scientific research—and will incorporate the joint venture. In that case, the resulting \nbusiness—known as a “joint venture corporation”—is governed by corporation law, not the law of partnership, \nand is not a joint venture in the sense described here. Increasingly, companies are forming joint ventures to do \nbusiness abroad; foreign investors or governments own significant interests in these joint ventures. For example, \nin 1984 General Motors entered into a joint venture with Toyota to revive GM’s shuttered Fremont, California, \nassembly plant to create New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). For GM the joint venture was an \nopportunity to learn about lean manufacturing from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first \nmanufacturing base in North America and a chance to test its production system in an American labor \nenvironment. Until May 2010, when the copartnership ended and the plant closed, NUMMI built an average of six \nthousand vehicles a week, or nearly eight million cars and trucks. These vehicles were the Chevrolet Nova (1984–\n88), the Geo Prizm (1989–97), the Chevrolet Prizm (1998–2002), and the Hilux (1991–95, predecessor of the \nTacoma), as well as the Toyota Voltz, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Pontiac Vibe.

Employment Security Commission \n274 A.2d 707 (Del. 1971) \n \nSTOREY, J. \n \nThe Employment Security Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, levied an involuntary \nassessment against Richard K. Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important. Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade. The paragraph also declared that upon \ndissolution of the partnership, ownership of items would revert to the party providing them.

On the other hand, distribution of partnership assets to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n475 \npartners upon dissolution is only allowed after all partnership liabilities are satisfied. But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent, \ncoupled with the absence of profit sharing, they become strong factors in discrediting the partnership \nargument. Such weighing of the elements against a partnership finding compares favorably with Fenwick \nv. Unemployment Compensation Commission, which decided against the partnership theory on similar \nfacts, including the filing of partnership income tax forms. \n \nIn addition, the total circumstances of the case taken together indicate the employer-employee \nrelationship between Chaiken and his barbers. The agreement set forth the hours of work and days off—\nunusual subjects for partnership agreements. The barbers brought into the relationship only the \nequipment required of all barber shop operators. And each barber had his own individual “partnership”",

Shanahan and Loomis subsequently alleged that their cattle were \nmalnourished and that a number of their cattle died from starvation that winter at Whitehead’s ranch. \nWhitehead denied these allegations. \n \nSuit against Whitehead \nThe following summer, Shanahan and Loomis sued Whitehead, claiming negligence and breach of \ncontract.

The district court agreed with Whitehead, granted the motion, \nand dismissed Loomis and Shanahan’s claims.

We agree.… \n \nWhen looking at a statute’s language, this court is bound to follow the statute’s plain meaning, unless the \nplain meaning was clearly not intended. Here, in using the phrase “under the assumed or fictitious name,” \nthe statute clearly bars bringing an action when the claims arise from a contract, transaction, or business \nconducted beneath the banner of an unregistered fictitious name.

Moreover, Whitehead does not allege \nthat he was misled by either Loomis or Shanahan in any way that would cause him to think he was doing \nbusiness with the 52 Cattle Company. In fact, Whitehead did not know of the 52 Cattle Company until \nShanahan mentioned it in his deposition.

This doctrine is based on the principle of estoppel, which prevents a person from denying a representation that they have made to another party. In the context of a partnership, the doctrine of partnership by estoppel allows a person to be held liable for the debts and obligations of a partnership if they have held themselves out to the public as a partner, or if they have knowingly or negligently permitted another person to do so. This doctrine is used to prevent fraud and to protect the interests of creditors and other third parties who have dealt with the partnership on the assumption that the person in question is a partner."

She might end up having to pay if the partnership hired a \nsubstitute to do her work. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n493 \nIn general, this requires partners to put the firm’s interests ahead of their own. Partners are fiduciaries as \nto each other and as to the partnership, and as such, they owe a fiduciary duty to each other and the \npartnership. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty “something \nstricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most \nsensitive, is then the standard of behavior.” [3]Breach of the fiduciary duty gives rise to a claim for \ncompensatory, consequential, and incidental damages; recoupment of compensation; and—rarely—\npunitive damages. See Section 12.4.1 \"Breach of Partnership Fiduciary Duty\", Gilroy v. Conway, for an \nexample of breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n \nApplication of the Fiduciary Standard to Partnership Law \nUnder UPA, all partners are fiduciaries of each other—they are all principals and agents of each other—\nthough the word fiduciary was not used except in the heading to Section 21. The section reads, “Every \npartner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by \nhim without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, \nconduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.” \n \nSection 404 of RUPA specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other \npartners. It imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three circumstances: \n \n(1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived \nby the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use \nby the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership \nopportunity; \n \n(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership \nbusiness as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n494 \n(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business \nbefore the dissolution of the partnership.",

Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”?

The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404.

The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights. A partner’s \n‘transferable interest’ is a more limited concept and means only his share of the profits and losses and",

It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty? Section 28 of UPA and RUPA Section 504 permit a judgment creditor to obtain \na charging order, which charges the partner’s interest in the partnership with obligation to satisfy the \njudgment. The court may appoint a receiver to ensure that partnership proceeds are paid to the judgment \ncreditor. But the creditor is not entitled to specific partnership property. The partner may always pay off \nthe debt and redeem his interest in the partnership.

Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners.

Understand the dissolution of general partnerships under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). \n2. Understand the dissociation and dissolution of general partnerships under the Revised Uniform Partnership \nAct (RUPA). \n3. Explain the winding up of partnerships under UPA and RUPA. \n \n \nIt is said that a partnership is like a marriage, and that extends to its ending too. It’s easier to get into a \npartnership than it is to get out of it because legal entanglements continue after a person is no longer a \npartner. The rules governing “getting out” of a partnership are different under the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) than under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). We take up UPA first. \n \nDissolution of Partnerships under UPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n512 \nDissolution, in the most general sense, means a separation into component parts. \n \nMeaning of Dissolution under UPA \nPeople in business are sometimes confused about the meaning of dissolution. It does not mean the \ntermination of a business. It has a precise legal definition, given in UPA Section 29: “The dissolution of a \npartnership is the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in \nthe carrying on as distinguished from the winding up of the business.” The partnership is not necessarily \nterminated on dissolution; rather, it continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed, \nand the remaining partners may choose to continue on as a new partnership if they want. [1] But, again, \nunder UPA the partnership dissolves upon the withdrawal of any partner. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nPartnerships can dissolve for a number of reasons. [2] \n \nIn Accordance with the Agreement \nThe term of the partnership agreement may have expired or the partnership may be at will and one of the \npartners desires to leave it. All the partners may decide that it is preferable to dissolve rather than to \ncontinue. One of the partners may have been expelled in accordance with a provision in the agreement. In \nnone of these circumstances is the agreement violated, though its spirit surely might have been. Professor \nSamuelson calls to mind the example of William Dean Howells’s Silas Lapham, who forces his partner to \nsell out by offering him an ultimatum: “You may buy me out or I’ll buy you out.” The ultimatum was given",

In the former case, the remaining partners are liable for damages for wrongful \ndissolution, and in the latter case, the withdrawing partner is liable to the remaining partners the same \nway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n513 \n \nBy Operation of Law \nA third reason for dissolution is the occurrence of some event, such as enactment of a statute, that makes \nit unlawful to continue the business.

[7] The firm may need to borrow money to pay the former partner or her \nestate; or, in the case of a deceased partner, the money to pay the former partner is obtained through a life \ninsurance buyout policy. \n \nPartnerships routinely insure the lives of the partners, who have no ownership interests in the insurance \npolicies. The policies should bear a face amount equal to each partner’s interest in the partnership and \nshould be adjusted as the fortunes of the partnership change. Proceeds of the insurance policy are used on \ndeath to pay the purchase price of the interest inherited by the deceased’s estate. If the insurance policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n515 \npays out more than the interest at stake, the partnership retains the difference.

In any event, common agreement formats for dissolution will provide for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n519 \nbuilt-in dispute resolution, and enlightened partners often agree to such mechanisms in advance to \navoid the kinds of problems listed here. \n• \nAny partnership will dissolve upon the happening of an event the partners specified would cause \ndissolution in their agreement. They may change their minds, of course, agree to continue, and amend \nthe partnership agreement accordingly. \n• \nA term partnership may be dissolved before its term expires in three ways. First, if a partner \ndissociated by death, declaring bankruptcy, becoming incapacitated, or wrongfully dissociates, the \npartnership will dissolve if within ninety days of that triggering dissociation at least half the \nremaining partners express their will to wind it up. Second, the partnership may be dissolved if the \nterm expires. Third, it may be dissolved if all the partners agree to amend the partnership agreement \nby expressly agreeing to dissolve. \n \n(2) Dissolution will happen in some cases by operation of law if it becomes illegal to continue the \nbusiness, or substantially all of it. For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable.

It is the amount that would have been distributed to the \ndissociated partner if, on the date of dissociation, the firm’s assets were sold “at a price equal to the \ngreater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern,” \nminus damages for wrongful dissociation.

The partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business, \nafter which it is terminated.

While “reasonably \npracticable” is not defined in RUPA, the term is broad enough to encompass the inability of partners to \ncontinue working together, which is what the court found. \n \nCertainly the law predating RUPA allowed for recovery of lost profits upon the wrongful dissolution of a \npartnership.

It follows that the pre-RUPA cases providing for future damages \nupon wrongful dissolution are no longer applicable to a partnership dissolution. In other words a \n“wrongful dissolution” referred to in the pre-RUPA case law is now, under RUPA, known as “wrongful \ndissociation.” Simply stated, under [RUPA], only when a partner dissociates and the dissociation is \nwrongful can the remaining partners sue for damages.

Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability, partnerships \nthe inestimable benefit of limited taxation. Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their \ntaxation. \n \nAt base, whether to allow businesspeople and investors to grasp the holy grail of limited liability is a \npolitical issue. When we say a person is “irresponsible,” it means he (or she, or it) does not take \nresponsibility for his harmful actions; the loss is borne by others. Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment.

A revised version, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), was adopted \nby the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1976 and further amended in 1985 and \nin 2001. \n \nThe 2001 act was \ndrafted for a world in which limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies can \nmeet many of the needs formerly met by limited partnerships.

This Act therefore targets two \ntypes of enterprises that seem largely beyond the scope of LLPs and LLCs: (i) sophisticated, \nmanager-entrenched commercial deals whose participants commit for the long term, and (ii) \nestate planning arrangements (family limited partnerships). The Act accordingly assumes that, \nmore often than not, people utilizing it will want (1) strong centralized management, strongly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n549 \nentrenched, and (2) passive investors with little control over or right to exit the entity. The Act’s \nrules, and particularly its default rules, have been designed to reflect these assumptions.

                    "answer": "A limited liability company (LLC) is a business structure that combines the limited liability features of a corporation with the tax benefits and operational flexibility of a partnership. A corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners, also known as shareholders. The owners of a corporation are not personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the company, which means that their personal assets are protected in the event that the company is sued or unable to pay its debts. A corporation is also subject to double taxation, meaning that the company is taxed on its profits and the shareholders are taxed on any dividends they receive. In contrast, an LLC is a pass-through entity, meaning that the profits and losses of the company are passed through to the owners, who are then taxed on their personal income tax returns. This can result in lower overall tax liability for the owners of an LLC.

                    "answer": "A limited liability company (LLC) and a partnership are both business structures that offer limited liability protection to their owners. However, there are several key differences between the two. A partnership is a business structure in which two or more people join together to carry on a business for profit. The partners share the profits and losses of the business, and each partner is personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. A limited liability company (LLC) is a business structure that combines the limited liability features of a corporation with the tax benefits and operational flexibility of a partnership. The owners of an LLC are called members, and they share in the profits and losses of the business. However, the members of an LLC are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the LLC, which means that their personal assets are protected in the event that the LLC is sued or unable to pay its debts. Additionally, an LLC is a pass-through entity, meaning that the profits and losses of the company are passed through to the members, who are then taxed on their personal income tax returns. This can result in lower overall tax liability for the members of an LLC. In terms of operational flexibility, an LLC has more flexibility than a partnership. For example, an LLC can have a single member or multiple members, whereas a partnership must have at least two members. Additionally, an LLC can have a more flexible management structure, with the members having more control over the decision-making process. Overall, the main difference between an LLC and a partnership is that an LLC offers limited liability protection to its members, whereas a partnership does not. This means that the members of an LLC are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the LLC, whereas the partners of a partnership are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership."

Comprehend the historical significance of corporate formation. \n2. Learn about key court decisions and their effect on interstate commerce and corporate formation. \n3. Become acquainted with how states formed their corporate laws. \n \n \nA Fixture of Every Major Legal System \nLike partnership, the corporation is an ancient concept, recognized in the Code of Hammurabi, and to \nsome degree a fixture in every other major legal system since then. The first corporations were not \nbusiness enterprises; instead, they were associations for religious and governmental ends in which \nperpetual existence was a practical requirement. Thus until relatively late in legal history, kings, popes, \nand jurists assumed that corporations could be created only by political or ecclesiastical authority and that \ncorporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711).

When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread.

Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589",

The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by \nDelaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present \nday there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an \naddress on file with the secretary of state in Dover. \n \nDuring the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform \nBusiness Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws.

Yet the Supreme Court \nrecently affirmed in Citizens United v.

In Citizens United, the Court struck down the part of the McCain-Feingold Act [2] that \nprohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting \n“electioneering communications.” \nAbsence of Rights \nCorporations lack certain rights that natural persons possess. For example, corporations do not have the \nprivilege against self-incrimination guaranteed for natural persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation.

Its president, one of the company’s largest creditors and \nalso virtually its sole owner, instigated the fire. The corporation sued the insurance company to recover \nthe amount for which it was insured. According to the court in the Felsenthal case, “The general rule of \nlaw is that the willful burning of property by a stockholder in a corporation is not a defense against the \ncollection of the insurance by the corporation, and…the corporation cannot be prevented from collecting \nthe insurance because its agents willfully set fire to the property without the participation or authority of \nthe corporation or of all of the stockholders of the corporation.” [3] But because the fire was caused by the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n596 \nbeneficial owner of “practically all” the stock, who also “has the absolute management of [the \ncorporation’s] affairs and its property, and is its president,” the court refused to allow the company to \nrecover the insurance money; allowing the company to recover would reward fraud. [4] \n \nFailure to Act as a Corporation \nIn other limited circumstances, individual stockholders may also be found personally liable. Failure to \nfollow corporate formalities, for example, may subject stockholders to personal liability. This is a \nspecial risk that small, especially one-person, corporations run. Particular factors that bring this rule into \nplay include inadequate capitalization, omission of regular meetings, failure to record minutes of \nmeetings, failure to file annual reports, and commingling of corporate and personal assets. Where these \nfactors exist, the courts may look through the corporate veil and pluck out the individual stockholder or \nstockholders to answer for a tort, contract breach, or the like. The classic case is the taxicab operator who \nincorporates several of his cabs separately and services them through still another corporation. If one of \nthe cabs causes an accident, the corporation is usually “judgment proof” because the corporation will have \nfew assets (practically worthless cab, minimum insurance).

In some states, statutes give employees \nspecial rights against shareholders.

Major cities and counties, and many \ntowns, villages, and special governmental units, such as sewer, transportation, and public utility \nauthorities, are incorporated.

During \nthe 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax \nbenefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a professional corporation just as it would \nany other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of \ntax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension.

Congress has chartered several enterprises, including national \nbanks (under the National Banking Act), federal savings and loan associations, national farm loan \nassociations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract.

            "chunk": "attempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware?",

Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed. If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable.",

If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable. \n \nNow assume that the corporation is formed on October 15, and on October 18 it formally accepts all the \ncontracts that Bob signed prior to October 15. Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance. Under RMBCA, Section 6.20, however, a \nsubscription for shares is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement itself provides",

For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles of incorporation typically include the \nfollowing: the corporate name; the address of the corporation’s initial registered office; the period of the \ncorporation’s duration (usually perpetual); the company’s purposes; the total number of shares, the \nclasses into which they are divided, and the par value of each; the limitations and rights of each class of \nshareholders; the authority of the directors to establish preferred or special classes of stock; provisions for \npreemptive rights; provisions for the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation, including any \nprovision restricting the transfer of shares; the number of directors constituting the initial board of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n606 \ndirectors and the names and addresses of initial members; and the name and address of each \nincorporator.

For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes. Section 3.01 of the RMBCA goes one step further in providing that a corporation \nautomatically “has the purpose of engaging in any lawful business” unless the articles specify a more \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n607 \nlimited purpose.

Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1. When (but only when) the corporate veil may be pierced, a parent corporation may be charged with \nderivative CERCLA liability for its subsidiary’s actions in operating a polluting facility. It is a general \nprinciple of corporate law that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of \nanother corporation’s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. CERCLA does not purport to reject \nthis bedrock principle, and the Government has indeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as \nan owner or an operator under §107(a)(2) simply because its subsidiary owns or operates a polluting \nfacility. But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary \nrelationship as well as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for \nthe corporation’s conduct when, inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish \ncertain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud, on the shareholder’s behalf.

What are the differences between creating a corporation de facto and by estoppel? \n \n \n \n \n14.8 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThe hallmark of the corporate form of business enterprise is limited liability for its owners. Other features \nof corporations are separation of ownership and management, perpetual existence, and easy \ntransferability of interests. In the early years of the common law, corporations were thought to be \ncreatures of sovereign power and could be created only by state grant. But by the late nineteenth century, \ncorporations could be formed by complying with the requirements of general corporation statutes in \nvirtually every state. Today the standard is the Revised Model Business Corporation Act. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n625 \n \nThe corporation, as a legal entity, has many of the usual rights accorded natural persons. The principle of \nlimited liability is broad but not absolute: when the corporation is used to commit a fraud or an injustice \nor when the corporation does not act as if it were one, the courts will pierce the corporate veil and pin \nliability on stockholders. \n \nBesides the usual business corporation, there are other forms, including not-for-profit corporations and \nprofessional corporations. Business corporations are classified into two types: publicly held and closely \nheld corporations. \n \nTo form a corporation, the would-be stockholders must choose the state in which they wish to \nincorporate. The goal of the incorporation process is issuance of a corporate charter. The charter is a \ncontract between the state and the corporation. Although the Constitution prohibits states from impairing \nthe obligation of contracts, states reserve the right to modify corporate charters. \n \nThe corporation is created by the incorporators (or promoters), who raise capital, enter into contracts on \nbehalf of the corporation to be formed, and prepare the articles of incorporation. The promoters are \npersonally liable on the contracts they enter into before the corporation is formed. Incorporators owe a \nfiduciary duty to each other, to investors, and to the corporation.",

Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups. Generally, private equity firms that provide a lot \nof venture capital must be extremely savvy about the start-up plans of new businesses and must ask the \nstart-up entrepreneurs numerous challenging and pertinent questions. Such private equity firms expect a \nhigher rate of return on their investment than would be available from established companies. Today, \nventure capital is often used to finance entrepreneurial start-ups in biotechnology and clean technology. \n \nSometimes, a private equity firm will buy all the publicly traded shares of a company—a process \ncommonly termed “going private.” Private equity may also be involved in providing financing to \nestablished firms. \n \nAnother source of private equity is angel investors, affluent individuals who operate like venture \ncapitalists, providing capital for a business to get started in exchange for repayment with interest or an \nownership interest.

This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration.

There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy.

The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends",

                    "answer": "A stock split is a corporate action in which the number of shares of a company's stock increases, but the total market capitalization of the company remains the same. This is accomplished by dividing each existing share into multiple shares. For example, a 2-for-1 stock split would result in each shareholder receiving two shares for every one share they held before the split. This effectively reduces the price of each share, making it more affordable for investors. A stock split does not change the value of the company or the ownership of its shareholders. It is primarily used to make the stock more accessible to a wider range of investors and to increase liquidity in the stock market."

This is typically done when a company has excess assets that it no longer needs or when it wants to distribute a portion of its assets to its shareholders. Property dividends are typically taxed differently than cash dividends, and the tax treatment can vary depending on the type of property being distributed.

Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v.

(For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule).

One method is to reinvest profits in the \ncorporation. Another method is to use private equity. Private equity involves financing from private \ninvestors, whether individuals (angel investors) or a private equity firm. Venture capital is often used as a \nfundraising mechanism by businesses that are just starting operations. \n \nA third method is to finance through debt, such as a loan or a bond. A corporation sells a bond and agrees \nto make interest payments over the life of the bond and to pay the face value of the bond at the bond’s \nmaturity. \nThe final important method of raising capital is by the sale of stock. The articles of incorporation govern \nthe total number of shares of stock that the corporation may issue, although it need not issue the \nmaximum. Stock in the hands of shareholders is said to be authorized, issued, and outstanding. Stock may \nhave a par value, which is usually the floor price of the stock. No-par shares may be sold for any price set \nby the directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n663 \nPreferred stock (1) may have a dividend preference, (2) takes preference upon liquidation, and (3) may be \nconvertible.

Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions.

At the annual meeting, the shareholders decide to issue an additional 1,000 shares at par and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n678 \nto sell them to Alice. Carol vehemently objects because her percentage of ownership will decline. She goes \nto court seeking an injunction against the sale or an order permitting her to purchase 200 of the shares \n(she currently has 20 percent of the total). How should the court rule? \n \nThe answer depends on the statutory provision dealing with preemptive rights—that is, the right of a \nshareholder to be protected from dilution of her percentage of ownership. In some states, shareholders \nhave no preemptive rights unless expressly declared in the articles of incorporation, while other states \ngive shareholders preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation deny it. Preemptive rights were \nonce strongly favored, but they are increasingly disappearing, especially in large publicly held companies \nwhere ownership is already highly diluted. \n \nDerivative Actions \nSuppose Carol discovers that Ted has been receiving kickbacks from publishers and has been splitting the \nproceeds with Bob. When at a directors’ meeting, Carol demands that the corporation file suit to recover \nthe sums they pocketed, but Bob and Ted outvote her. Carol has another remedy. She can file a \nderivative action against them. A derivative lawsuit is one brought on behalf of the corporation by a \nshareholder when the directors refuse to act. Although the corporation is named as a defendant in the \nsuit, the corporation itself is the so-called real party in interest—the party entitled to recover if the \nplaintiff wins. \n \nWhile derivative actions are subject to abuse by plaintiffs’ attorneys seeking settlements that pay their \nfees, safeguards have been built into the law. At least ninety days before starting a derivative action, for \ninstance, shareholders must demand in writing that the corporation take action.

The board of directors and officers exercise much of the power. Shareholders exercise their power \nat meetings, typically through voting for directors. Statutes, bylaws, and the articles of incorporation \ndetermine how voting occurs—such as whether a quorum is sufficient to hold a meeting or whether voting is \ncumulative. Shareholders need not be present at a meeting—they may use a proxy to cast their votes or set \nup voting trusts or voting agreements. Shareholders may view corporate documents with proper demand and \na proper purpose. Some corporations permit shareholders preemptive rights—the ability to purchase \nadditional shares to ensure that the ownership percentage is not diluted. A shareholder may also file suit on \nbehalf of the corporation—a legal proceeding called a derivative action. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Explain cumulative voting.

Normally, the \npresident is the chief executive officer (CEO) to whom all other officers and employees report, but \nsometimes the CEO is also the chairman of the board. \n \nNumber and Election of Directors \nSection 8.03 of the RMBCA provides that there must be one director, but there may be more, the precise \nnumber to be fixed in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors. In that case, if the articles of incorporation \nso provide, the board may be divided into two or three roughly equal classes and their terms staggered, so \nthat the second class is elected at the second annual meeting and the third at the third annual meeting.

The directors were held liable for $23.5 million for this breach. [2] Thus \nserving as a director or an officer was never free of business risks. Today, the task is fraught with legal risk \nas well. \n \nTwo main fiduciary duties apply to both directors and officers: one is a duty of loyalty, the other the duty \nof care. These duties arise from responsibilities placed upon directors and officers because of their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n685 \npositions within the corporation. The requirements under these duties have been refined over time. \nCourts and legislatures have both narrowed the duties by defining what is or is not a breach of each duty \nand have also expanded their scope. Courts have further refined the duties, such as laying out tests such \nas in the Caremark case, outlined in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\". Additionally, other duties have been \ndeveloped, such as the duties of good faith and candor. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nAs a fiduciary of the corporation, the director owes his primary loyalty to the corporation and its \nstockholders, as do the officers and majority shareholders. This responsibility is called \nthe duty of loyalty. When there is a conflict between a director’s personal interest and the interest of the \ncorporation, he is legally bound to put the corporation’s interest above his own.

Pritchard and his sons routinely took loans from the \naccounts of the firm’s clients. After Pritchard died, his sons increased their borrowing, eventually sending \nthe business into bankruptcy. During this time, Mrs. Pritchard developed a fondness for alcohol, drinking \nheavily and paying little attention to her directorship responsibilities. Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation.

The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to \nwhich we now turn. For further discussions of the business judgment rule, see Cede & Co. v.

As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v.

Other groups—\nemployees, local communities and neighbors, customers, suppliers, and creditors—took a back seat to this \nprimary responsibility of directors. Of course, directors could consider the welfare of these other groups if \nin so doing they promoted the interests of shareholders. But directors were not legally permitted to favor \nthe interests of others over shareholders. The prevailing rule was, and often still is, that maximizing \nshareholder value is the primary duty of the board. Thus in Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes \nHoldings, Inc., [16] the Delaware Supreme Court held that Revlon’s directors had breached their fiduciary \nduty to the company’s shareholders in response to a hostile tender offer from Pantry Pride. While the facts \nof the case are intricate, the general gist is that the Revlon directors thwarted the hostile tender by \nadopting a variation of a poison pill involving a tender offer for their own shares in exchange for debt, \neffectively eliminating Pantry Pride’s ability to take over the firm. Pantry Pride upped its offer price, and \nin response, Revlon began negotiating with a leveraged buyout by a third party, Forstmann Little. Pantry \nPride publicly announced it would top any bid made by Forstmann Little. Despite this, the Revlon board \nnegotiated a deal with Forstmann Little.

It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits. This ability has been \nfurther expanding as the concept of corporate social responsibility has grown, as discussed later in this \nsection. \n \nAlthough the other constituency statutes are not identically worded, they are all designed to release \ndirectors from their formal legal obligation to keep paramount the interests of shareholders. The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy.

Second, they make it more difficult for \nshareholders to monitor the performance of a company’s board; measuring decisions against the single \ngoal of profit maximization is far easier than against the subjective goal of “balancing” a host of competing \ninterests. Constituency statutes run contrary to the concept of shareholders as owners, and of the \nfiduciary duties owed to them, effectively softening shareholder power. Nevertheless, since many states \nnow have constituency statutes, it is only reasonable to expect that the traditional doctrine holding \nshareholder interests paramount will begin to give way, even as the shareholders challenge new decisions \nby directors that favor communities, employees, and others with an important stake in the welfare of the \ncorporations with which they deal.

For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof.

As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law. Delaware Code Section 102(b)(7), as mentioned previously, was \nenacted after Smith v. Van Gorkom (discussed in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\") and was prompted by an \noutcry about the court’s decision. As a result, many corporations now use similar provisions to limit \ndirector liability. For example, Delaware and California permit the limitation or abolition of liability for \ndirector’s breach of the duty of care except in instances of fraud, bad faith, or willful misconduct. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nDirectors and officers have two main fiduciary duties: the duty of loyalty and the duty of care. The duty of \nloyalty is a responsibility to act in the best interest of the corporation, even when that action may conflict with \na personal interest. This duty commonly arises in contracts with the corporation and with corporate \nopportunities. The duty of care requires directors and officers to act with the care of an ordinarily prudent \nperson in like circumstances. The business judgment rule may protect directors and officers, since courts give \na presumption to the corporation that its personnel are informed and act in good faith. A shareholder may file \na derivative lawsuit on behalf of the corporation against corporate insiders for breaches of these fiduciary \nobligations or other actions that harm the corporation.

Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club. The plaintiff sought to bring a female \nto lunch with him, and both he and his guest were refused seating at the luncheon facility. The plaintiff \nwrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either \nletter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected. Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate \npollings of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative \nproposals for amending the bylaws of corporation concerning the admission of women members and \nguests. None of these proposed amendments to the bylaws received the required number of votes for \nadoption. Following that balloting, the plaintiff again wrote to the president of the corporation and asked \nthat the directors stop interfering with his rights as a member to bring women guests to the luncheon \nfacility and to propose women for membership. The president’s reply was that “the existing bylaws, house \nrules and customs continue in effect, and therefore [the board] consider[s] the matter closed.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n699 \n \n* * * \n \nIn addition to seeking a declaratory judgment which will inform him of his rights vis-à-vis the corporation",

In approaching that question, we note that the Chancellor characterized that definition as \n“anappropriate (although not the only) standard for determining whether fiduciaries have acted in good \nfaith.” That observation is accurate and helpful, because as a matter of simple logic, at least three different \ncategories of fiduciary behavior are candidates for the “bad faith” pejorative label. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n705 \nThe first category involves so-called “subjective bad faith,” that is, fiduciary conduct motivated by an \nactual intent to do harm.

The conduct that is the subject of due care \nmay overlap with the conduct that comes within the rubric of good faith in a psychological sense, but from \na legal standpoint those duties are and must remain quite distinct.… \n \nThe Delaware General Assembly has addressed the distinction between bad faith and a failure to exercise \ndue care (i.e., gross negligence) in two separate contexts. The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del.

To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith. In our view it must be, for at least two reasons. \n \nFirst, the universe of fiduciary misconduct is not limited to either disloyalty in the classic sense (i.e., \npreferring the adverse self-interest of the fiduciary or of a related person to the interest of the \ncorporation) or gross negligence. Cases have arisen where corporate directors have no conflicting self-\ninterest in a decision, yet engage in misconduct that is more culpable than simple inattention or failure to \nbe informed of all facts material to the decision.

A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. A failure to act in good faith may be \nshown, for instance, where the fiduciary intentionally acts with a purpose other than that of advancing the \nbest interests of the corporation, where the fiduciary acts with the intent to violate applicable positive law, \nor where the fiduciary intentionally fails to act in the face of a known duty to act, demonstrating a \nconscious disregard for his duties. There may be other examples of bad faith yet to be proven or alleged, \nbut these three are the most salient. \n \n…Second, the legislature has also recognized this intermediate category of fiduciary misconduct, which \nranks between conduct involving subjective bad faith and gross negligence. Section 102(b)(7)(ii) of the \nDGCL expressly denies money damage exculpation for “acts or omissions not in good faith or which \ninvolve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.” By its very terms that provision \ndistinguishes between “intentional misconduct” and a “knowing violation of law” (both examples of \nsubjective bad faith) on the one hand, and “acts…not in good faith,” on the other. Because the statute \nexculpates directors only for conduct amounting to gross negligence, the statutory denial of exculpation \nfor “acts…not in good faith” must encompass the intermediate category of misconduct captured by the \nChancellor’s definition of bad faith. \n \nFor these reasons, we uphold the Court of Chancery’s definition as a legally appropriate, although not the \nexclusive, definition of fiduciary bad faith.

Shareholders may use \nseveral voting arrangements that concentrate power, including proxies, voting agreements, and voting \ntrusts. Proxies are regulated under rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n \nCorporations may deny preemptive rights—the rights of shareholders to prevent dilution of their \npercentage of ownership—by so stating in the articles of incorporation. Some states say that in the \nabsence of such a provision, shareholders do have preemptive rights; others say that there are no \npreemptive rights unless the articles specifically include them. \n \nDirectors have the ultimate authority to run the corporation and are fiduciaries of the firm. In large \ncorporations, directors delegate day-to-day management to salaried officers, whom they may fire, in most \nstates, without cause. The full board of directors may, by majority, vote to delegate its authority to \ncommittees. \n \nDirectors owe the company a duty of loyalty and of care. A contract between a director and the company is \nvoidable unless fair to the corporation or unless all details have been disclosed and the disinterested \ndirectors or shareholders have approved. Any director or officer is obligated to inform fellow directors of \nany corporate opportunity that affects the company and may not act personally on it unless he has \nreceived approval. The duty of care is the obligation to act “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a \nlike position would exercise under similar circumstances.” Other fiduciary duties have also been \nrecognized, and constituency statutes permit the corporation to consider factors other than shareholders \nin making decisions. Shareholders may file derivative suits alleging breaches of fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe duties have been expanded. For example, when the corporation is being sold, the directors have a \nduty to maximize shareholder value. Duties of oversight, good faith, and candor have been applied. \n \nThe corporation may agree, although not in every situation, to indemnify officers, directors, and \nemployees for litigation expenses when they are made party to suits involving the corporation.

Their inherent \nvalue lies in the interest in property or an ongoing enterprise that they represent. This disparity between \nthe tangible property—the stock certificate, for example—and the intangible interest it represents gives \nrise to several reasons for regulation. First, there is need for a mechanism to inform the buyer accurately \nwhat it is he is buying. Second, laws are necessary to prevent and provide remedies for deceptive and \nmanipulative acts designed to defraud buyers and sellers. Third, the evolution of stock trading on a \nmassive scale has led to the development of numerous types of specialists and professionals, in dealings \nwith whom the public can be at a severe disadvantage, and so the law undertakes to ensure that they do \nnot take unfair advantage of their customers. \n \nThe Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are two federal statutes that \nare vitally important, having virtually refashioned the law governing corporations during the past half \ncentury. In fact, it is not too much to say that although they deal with securities, they have become the \ngeneral federal law of corporations. This body of federal law has assumed special importance in recent \nyears as the states have engaged in a race to the bottom in attempting to compete with Delaware’s \npermissive corporation law (see Chapter 14 \"Corporation: General Characteristics and Formation\"). \n \nWhat Is a Security? \nSecurities law questions are technical and complex and usually require professional counsel. For the \nnonlawyer, the critical question on which all else turns is whether the particular investment or document \nis a security. If it is, anyone attempting any transaction beyond the routine purchase or sale through a \nbroker should consult legal counsel to avoid the various civil and criminal minefields that the law has \nstrewn about. \n \nThe definition of security, which is set forth in the Securities Act of 1933, is comprehensive, but it does \nnot on its face answer all questions that financiers in a dynamic market can raise. Under Section 2(1) of \nthe act, “security” includes “any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, \ncertificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n715",

As a \nresult, one of many statutes enacted in the aftermath of Watergate, the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977, was incorporated into the 1934 Securities Exchange \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n725 \nAct. The SEC’s legal interest in the matter is not premised on the morality of bribery but rather on the \nfalsity of the financial statements that are being filed. \n \nCongress’s response to abuses of financial reporting, the FCPA, was much broader than necessary to treat \nthe violations that were uncovered. The FCPA prohibits an issuer (i.e., any US business enterprise), a \nstockholder acting on behalf of an issuer, and “any officer, director, employee, or agent” of an issuer from \nusing either the mails or interstate commerce corruptly to offer, pay, or promise to pay anything of value \nto foreign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates if the purpose is to gain business by inducing \nthe foreign official to influence an act of the government to render a decision favorable to the US \ncorporation. \n \nBut not all payments are illegal. Under 1988 amendments to the FCPA, payments may be made to \nexpedite routine governmental actions, such as obtaining a visa. And payments are allowed if they are \nlawful under the written law of a foreign country.

Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits. The law applies to any company with more than $10 million in assets and at \nleast five hundred or more shareholders of any class of stock. \n \nSuppose that on January 1, Bob (a company officer) purchases one hundred shares of stock in BCT \nBookstore, Inc., for $60 a share. On September 1, he sells them for $100 a share. What is the result? Bob \nis in the clear, because his $4,000 profit was not realized during a six-month period. Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why?

According to the court, “anyone in \npossession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is \ndisabled from disclosing to protect a corporate confidence, or he chooses not to do so, must abstain from \ntrading in or recommending the securities concerned while such inside information remains undisclosed.” \nOn remand, the district court ordered certain defendants to pay $148,000 into an escrow account to be \nused to compensate parties injured by the insider trading. \n \nThe court of appeals also concluded that the press release violated Rule 10b-5 if “misleading to the \nreasonable investor.” On remand, the district court held that TGS failed to exercise “due diligence” in \nissuing the release. Sixty-nine private damage actions were subsequently filed against TGS by \nshareholders who claimed they sold their stock in reliance on the release. The company settled most of \nthese suits in late 1971 for $2.7 million. \n \nFollowing the TGS episode, the Supreme Court refined Rule 10b-5 on several fronts. First, in Ernst & \nErnst v. Hochfelder, [3] the Court decided that proof of scienter—defined as “mental state embracing \nintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”—is required in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In \nother words, negligence alone will not result in Rule 10b-5 liability. The Court also held that scienter, \nwhich is an intentional act, must be established in SEC injunctive actions.

Securities and Exchange Commission (see Section 17.3.2 \"Tippee Liability\"), that \ntippees are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing \nconfidential information and the tipper received a personal benefit from the disclosure. \n \nThe Supreme Court has also refined Rule 10b-5 as it relates to the duty of a company to \ndisclose material information, as discussed in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson (see Section 17.3.3 \"Duty to \nDisclose Material Information\"). This case is also important in its discussion of the degree of reliance \ninvestors must prove to support a Rule 10b-5 action. \nIn 2000, the SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1, which defines trading “on the basis of” inside information as any \ntime a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. Therefore, a defendant is not saved \nby arguing that the trade was made independent of knowledge of the nonpublic information. However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v. O’Hagan, [7] and the SEC adopted the theory as \nnew Rule 10b5-2. Under this new rule, the duty of trust or confidence exists when (1) a person agrees to \nmaintain information in confidence; (2) the recipient knows or should have known through history, \npattern, or practice of sharing confidences that the person communicating the information expects \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n730 \nconfidentiality; and (3) a person received material nonpublic information from his or her spouse, parent, \nchild, or sibling.",

United States, [8] the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of a Wall Street \nJournal reporter who leaked advanced information about the contents of his “Heard on the Street” \ncolumn. The reporter, who was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, had been convicted on both mail \nand wire fraud and securities law charges for misappropriating information. The Court upheld the mail \nand wire fraud conviction by an 8–0 vote and the securities law conviction by a 4–4 vote. (In effect, the tie \nvote affirmed the conviction.) [9] \n \nBeyond these judge-made theories of liability, Congress had been concerned about insider trading, and in \n1984 and 1988, it substantially increased the penalties. A person convicted of insider trading now faces a \nmaximum criminal fine of $1 million and a possible ten-year prison term. A civil penalty of up to three \ntimes the profit made (or loss avoided) by insider trading can also be imposed. This penalty is in addition \nto liability for profits made through insider trading. For example, financier Ivan Boesky, who was \nsentenced in 1987 to a three-year prison term for insider trading, was required to disgorge $50 million of \nprofits and was liable for another $50 million as a civil penalty. In 2003, Martha Stewart was indicted on \ncharges of insider trading but was convicted for obstruction of justice, serving only five months. More \nrecently, in 2009, billionaire founder of the Galleon Group, Raj Rajaratnam, was arrested for insider \ntrading; he was convicted in May 2011 of all 14 counts of insider trading. For the SEC release on the \nMartha Stewart case, seehttp://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-69.htm. \n \nCompanies that knowingly and recklessly fail to prevent insider trading by their employees are subject to \na civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided by insider trading or $1 million, \nwhichever is greater.

We conclude that they are. \n \nThe Co-Op is an agricultural cooperative that, at the same time relevant here, had approximately 23,000 \nmembers. In order to raise money to support its general business operations, the Co-Op sold promissory \nnotes payable on demand by the holder. Although the notes were uncollateralized and uninsured, they \npaid a variable rate of interest that was adjusted monthly to keep it higher than the rate paid by local \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n733 \nfinancial institutions. The Co-Op offered the notes to both members and nonmembers, marketing the \nscheme as an “Investment Program.” Advertisements for the notes, which appeared in each Co-Op \nnewsletter, read in part: “YOUR CO-OP has more than $11,000,000 in assets to stand behind your \ninvestments. The Investment is not Federal [sic] insured but it is…Safe…Secure…and available when you \nneed it.” App. 5 (ellipses in original). Despite these assurances, the Co-Op filed for bankruptcy in 1984. At \nthe time of the filing, over 1,600 people held notes worth a total of $10 million. \nAfter the Co-Op filed for bankruptcy, petitioners, a class of holders of the notes, filed suit against Arthur \nYoung & Co., the firm that had audited the Co-Op’s financial statements (and the predecessor to \nrespondent Ernst & Young).

Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), concluding in the proxy-solicitation \ncontext that “[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n738 \nwould consider it important in deciding how to vote.”…We now expressly adopt the TSC Industries \nstandard of materiality for the 5 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. \n \nThe application of this materiality standard to preliminary merger discussions is not self-evident. Where \nthe impact of the corporate development on the target’s fortune is certain and clear, the TSC Industries \nmateriality definition admits straight-forward application. Where, on the other hand, the event is \ncontingent or speculative in nature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the “reasonable investor” would \nhave considered the omitted information significant at the time. Merger negotiations, because of the ever-\npresent possibility that the contemplated transaction will not be effectuated, fall into the latter category. \n \n* * * \n \nEven before this Court’s decision in TSC Industries, the Second Circuit had explained the role of the \nmateriality requirement of Rule 10b-5, with respect to contingent or speculative information or events, in \na manner that gave that term meaning that is independent of the other provisions of the Rule. Under such \ncircumstances, materiality “will depend at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated \nprobability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of \nthe company activity.” SEC v.

Furthermore, certain transactions may avoid a shareholder vote.

Inventory arrives in trucks operated by the Flying Truckman Co., Inc. The BCT \ncorporation concludes that the economics of delivery do not warrant purchasing a single truck dedicated \nto hauling books for its four stores alone. Then Bob learns that the owners of Flying Truckman might be \nwilling to part with their company because it has not been earning money lately. If BCT could reorganize \nFlying Truckman’s other routes, it could reduce its own shipping costs while making a profit on other lines \nof business. \n \nUnder the circumstances, the simplest and safest way to acquire Flying Truckman is by purchasing its \nassets.

Suppose BCT paid Flying Truckman $250,000 for its trucks, routes, and name. \nWith that cash, Flying Truckman paid off several of its creditors. Its shareholders then voted to dissolve \nthe corporation, leaving one creditor unsatisfied. The creditor can no longer sue Flying Truckman since it \ndoes not exist. So he sues BCT. Unless certain circumstances exist, as discussed in Ray v. Alad \nCorporation (see Section 18.4.1 \"Successor Liability\"), BCT is not liable for Flying Truckman’s debts. \n \nSeveral states, although not a majority, have adopted the Ray product-line exception approach to \nsuccessor liability. The general rule is that the purchasing corporation does not take the liabilities of the \nacquired corporation. Several exceptions exist, as described in Ray, the principal exception being the \nproduct-line approach. This minority exception has been further limited in several jurisdictions by \napplying it solely to cases involving products liability.

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt.

The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v.

Returning again to \nBCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the \nwisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying \nTruckman.

The first involves the purchase of assets not in the \nordinary course of business. Using this method, the purchase expands the corporation. The second and third \nmethods, merger and consolidation, are very similar: two or more corporations combine. In a merger, one of \nthe merging companies survives, and the other ceases to exist. In a consolidation, the merging corporations \ncease to exist when they combine to form a new corporation. The final method is a stock purchase, \naccomplished via a tender offer, takeover, or leveraged buyout. Federal and state regulations play a significant \nrole in takeovers and tender offers, particularly the Williams Act. A shareholder who does not wish to \nparticipate in a stock sale may invoke his appraisal rights and demand cash compensation for his shares. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

One rationale is that these statutes protect shareholders from being taken advantage of by corporate insiders. Another rationale is that these statutes help to ensure that corporations are run in the best interests of all shareholders, not just a few insiders.

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts.

            "chunk": "question might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state.

This provision is obviously applicable primarily to closely held corporations. \nDissolution can also be accomplished even if some shareholders dissent. The directors must first adopt a \nresolution by majority vote recommending the dissolution. The shareholders must then have an \nopportunity to vote on the resolution at a meeting after being notified of its purpose. A majority of the \noutstanding voting shares is necessary to carry the resolution. Although this procedure is most often used \nwhen a company has been inactive, nothing bars its use by large corporations. In 1979, UV Industries, \n357th on the Fortune 500 list, with profits of $40 million annually, voted to dissolve and to distribute \nsome $500 million to its stockholders, in part as a means of fending off a hostile takeover. Fortune \nmagazine referred to it as “a company that’s worth more dead than alive.” [2] \n \nOnce dissolution has been approved, the corporation may dissolve by filing a certificate or articles of \ndissolution with the secretary of state. The certificate may be filed as the corporation begins to wind up its \naffairs or at any time thereafter. The process of winding up is liquidation. The company must notify all \ncreditors of its intention to liquidate.

[4]California permits the initiation of involuntary dissolution by either half of the directors in \noffice or by a third of shareholders. \n \nJudicial Liquidation \nAction by Shareholder \nA shareholder may file suit to have a court dissolve the company on a showing that the company is being \nirreparably injured because the directors are deadlocked in the management of corporate affairs and the \nshareholders cannot break the deadlock.

Negotiability means that the paper is freely and unconditionally transferable from one \nperson to another by delivery or by delivery and indorsement. (“Indorsement,” not “endorsement,” is the \nspelling used in the UCC, though the latter is more common in nonlegal usage.) Without the ability to pay \nand finance through commercial paper, the business world would be paralyzed. At bottom, negotiability is \nthe means by which a person is empowered to transfer to another more than what the transferor himself \npossesses. In essence, this is the power to convey to a transferee the right in turn to convey clear title, \nwhen the original transferor does not have clear title. \n \nOverview of Chapters on Commercial Paper \nIn this chapter, we examine the history and nature of commercial paper and define the types of parties \n(persons who have an interest in the paper) and the types of instruments. We then proceed to four \nfundamental issues that must be addressed to determine whether parties such as First Bank, in the \npreceding example, can collect: \n1. Is the paper negotiable? That is, is the paper in the proper form? We explore that issue in this \nchapter. \n2. Was the paper negotiated properly? See Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n778 \n3. Is the purchaser of the paper a holder in due course? See Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and \nDefenses\". \n4. Does the maker of the paper have available any defenses against even the holder in due course? \nSee Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \nIn most transactions, especially when the first three questions are answered affirmatively, the purchaser \nwill have little trouble collecting. But when the purchaser is unable to collect, questions of liability arise. \nThese questions, along with termination of liability, are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\".",

They fell into disuse after the collapse of the Roman Empire and \nthen reappeared in Italy around the fourteenth century. They became more common as long-distance \ncommerce spread. In an era before paper currency, payment in coins or bullion was awkward, especially \nfor merchants who traveled great distances across national boundaries to attend the fairs at which most \neconomic exchanges took place. Merchants and traders found it far more efficient to pay with paper. \n \nBills of exchange, today commonly known as drafts, were recognized instruments in the law merchant. \n(The “law merchant” was the system of rules and customs recognized and adopted by early-modern \ntraders and is the basis of the UCC Article 3.) A draft is an unconditional order by one person (the drawer) \ndirecting another person (drawee or payor) to pay money to a named third person or to bearer; a check is \nthe most familiar type of draft. The international merchant courts regularly enforced drafts and permitted \nthem to be transferred to others by indorsement (the legal spelling of endorsement). By the beginning of \nthe sixteenth century, the British common-law courts began to hear cases involving bills of exchange, but \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n779 \nit took a half century before the courts became comfortable with them and accepted them as crucial to the \ngrowing economy. \n \nCourts were also hesitant until the end of the seventeenth century about sanctioning a transferor’s \nassignment of a promissory note if it meant that the transferee would have better title than the transferor. \nOne reason for the courts’ reluctance to sanction assignments stemmed from the law that permitted \ndebtors to be jailed, a law that was not repealed until 1870.

The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law.

It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

Article 3 is a set of general provisions \non negotiability; the other articles deal more narrowly with specific transactions or instruments. \n \nTypes of Commercial Paper \nThere are four types of commercial paper: drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit. \n \n \nDrafts \nA draft is an unconditional written order by one person (the drawer) directing another person (the \ndrawee) to pay a certain sum of money on demand or at a definite time to a named third person (the \npayee) or to bearer. The draft is one of the two basic types of commercial paper; the other is the note. As \nindicated by its definition, the draft is a three-party transaction. \n \nParties to a Draft \nThe drawer is one who directs a person or an entity, usually a bank, to pay a sum of money stated in an \ninstrument—for example, a person who makes a draft or writes a check. The drawer prepares a document \n(a form, usually)—the draft—ordering the drawee to remit a stated sum of money to the payee.

The most common drawee is a bank. The drawer, drawee, and payee need not be different people; the \nsame person may have different capacities in a single transaction. For example, a drawer (the person \nasking that payment be made) may also be the payee (the person to whom the payment is to be made). A \ndrawee who signs the draft becomes an acceptor: the drawee pledges to honor the draft as written. To \naccept, the drawee need only sign her name on the draft, usually vertically on the face, but anywhere will \ndo. Words such as “accepted” or “good” are unnecessary. However, a drawee who indicates that she might \nrefuse to pay will not be held to have accepted.

In England and the British Commonwealth, drafts are called bills \nof exchange. Like a draft, a bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest. Used \nprimarily in international trade, it is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a \nspecific date sometime in the future. If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft. If \nit is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft. Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a \ndraft, but whereas a draft is always negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true \nof a bill of exchange. \n \nA widely used draft in international trade is the banker’s acceptance. It is a short-term credit \ninvestment created by a nonfinancial firm and guaranteed by a bank. This instrument is used when an \nexporter agrees to extend credit to an importer. \n \nAssume Love, the importer, is in New York; Rackets, the exporter, is in Taiwan. Rackets is willing to \npermit Love to pay ninety days after shipment. Love makes a deal with her New York bank to issue \nRackets’ bank in Taiwan a letter of credit. This tells the seller’s bank that the buyer’s bank is willing to \naccept a draft drawn on the buyer in accordance with terms spelled out in the letter of credit. Love’s bank \nmay insist on a security interest in the tennis rackets, or it may conclude that Love is creditworthy. On \nreceipt of the letter of credit, Rackets presents its bank in Taiwan with a draft drawn on Love’s bank. That \nbank antes up the purchase amount (less its fees and interest), paying Rackets directly. It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786",

Section 3-104(2)(b) \nof the UCC defines a check as “a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand.” Postdating a check \n(putting in a future date) does not invalidate it or change its character as payable on demand. Postdating \nsimply changes the first time at which the payee may demand payment. Checks are, of course, usually \nwritten on paper forms, but a check can be written on anything—a door, a shirt, a rock—though certainly \nthe would-be holder is not obligated to accept it. \n \nLike drafts, checks may be accepted by the drawee bank. Bank acceptance of a check is \ncalled certification; the check is said to be certified by stamping the word “certified” on the face of the \ncheck. When the check is certified, the bank guarantees that it will honor the check when presented. It can \noffer this guarantee because it removes from the drawer’s account the face amount of the check and holds \nit for payment. The payee may demand payment from the bank but not from the drawer or any prior \nindorser of the check. \nA certified check is distinct from a cashier’s check. A cashier’s check is drawn on the account of the \nbank itself and signed by an authorized bank representative in return for a cash payment to it from the \ncustomer. The bank guarantees payment of the cashier’s check also. \n \nNotes \nA note—often called a promissory note—is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money on \ndemand or at a definite time. There are two parties to a note: the maker (promisor), and \nthe payee (promisee). For an example of a promissory note, see Figure 19.4 \"A Promissory Note\". The \nmaker might execute a promissory note in return for a money loan from a bank or other financial \ninstitution or in return for the opportunity to make a purchase on credit. \n \nFigure 19.4 A Promissory Note \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n787 \n \n \nCertificates of Deposit \nA fourth type of commercial paper is the certificate of deposit, commonly called a CD.

It can be typed or by thumbprint. In some cases, an appropriate letterhead may serve to \nmake the note or draft negotiable without any other signature. Nor does the position of the signature \nmatter. Blackstone Kent’s handwritten note, “Ten days from this note, I, Blackstone Kent, promise to pay \n$5,000 to the order of Webster Mews,” is sufficient to make the note negotiable, even though there is no \nsubsequent signature. Moreover, the signature may be in a trade name or an assumed name. (Note: \nspecial problems arise when an agent signs on behalf of a principal. We consider these problems \nin Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\".) \n \nUnconditional Promise or Order to Pay \nSection 3-106(a) of the UCC provides that an instrument is not negotiable if it “states (i) an express \ncondition to payment, (ii) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) \nthat rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing. A reference to \nanother writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.” Under 3-106(b), a promise is \nnot made conditional by “(i) reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to \ncollateral, pre-payment, or acceleration, or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or \nsource.” As to “reference to another writing,” see Holly Hill Acres, Ltd. v. Charter Bank of Gainesville, \nin Section 19.4 \"Cases\". \n \nThe only permissible promise or order in a negotiable instrument is to pay a sum certain in money. Any \nother promise or order negates negotiability. The reason for this rule is to prevent an instrument from \nhaving an indeterminate value.

For example, the note can state that the principal is $1,000 and the \ninterest is 11.5 percent, without specifying the total amount. Or the note could state the amount in \ninstallments: twelve equal installments of $88.25. Or it could state different interest rates before and after \na certain date or depending on whether or not the maker has defaulted; it could be determinable by a \nformula or by reference to a source described in the instrument. [2] It could permit the maker to take a \ndiscount if he pays before a certain date or could assess a penalty if he pays after the date. It could also \nprovide for an attorney’s fees and the costs of collection on default. If it is clear that interest is to be \nincluded but no interest amount is set, UCC Section 3-112 provides that it is “payable at the judgment rate \nin effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.” The fundamental \nrule is that for any time of payment, the holder must be able to determine, after the appropriate \ncalculations, the amount then payable. See Section 19.4 \"Cases\", Centerre Bank of Branson v. Campbell, \nfor a case involving the “fixed amount” rule. \n \nIn Money \nSection 1-201(24) of the UCC defines money as “a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a \ndomestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.” As long as the medium of exchange was such at \nthe time the instrument was made, it is payable in money, even if the medium of exchange has been \nabolished at the time the instrument is due. Section 3-107 provides the following as to payment in foreign \ncurrency: “Unless the instrument otherwise provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in \nforeign money may be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated by using \nthe current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the purchase of dollars on the day on which \nthe instrument is paid.” \n \nPayable on Demand or at a Definite Time \nAn instrument that says it is payable on sight is payable on demand, as is one that states no time for",

[3] Otherwise, to be enforceable, the \ninstrument must first be completed—if not by the maker or drawer, then by the holder in accordance with \nwhatever authority he has to do so. [4] See the case presented in Section 19.4 \"Cases\", Newman v. \nManufacturers Nat. Bank of Detroit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n795 \nAmbiguity \nWhen it is unclear whether the instrument is a note or draft, the holder may treat it as either. \nHandwritten terms control typewritten and printed terms, and typewritten terms control printed terms. \nWords control figures, unless the words themselves are ambiguous, in which case the figures control. If \nthe instrument contains a “conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or \norder is not negotiable,” its negotiability is destroyed, except for checks, and “an instrument may be a \ncheck even though it is described on its face by another term, such as ‘money order.’” [5] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIf an instrument is not negotiable, it generally will not be acceptable as payment in commercial transactions. \nThe UCC requires that the value of a negotiable instrument be ascertainable on its face, without reference to \nother documents. Thus the negotiable instrument must be in writing, signed by the maker or drawer, an \nunconditional promise or order to pay, for a fixed amount in money, payable on demand or at a definite time, \nand payable to order or bearer, unless it is a check. If the instrument is incomplete or ambiguous, the UCC \nprovides rules to determine what the instrument means. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why does the UCC require that the value of a negotiable instrument be ascertainable from its face, without \nextrinsic reference? \n2. What are the six requirements for an instrument to meet the negotiability test?",

Hotel Evans, Inc., [Citation] (1970), a note contained the notation “with \ninterest at bank rates.” Applying a section of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted by New York \nidentical to [3-104(a)] the court held the note was not a negotiable instrument in that the amount of \ninterest had to be established by facts outside the instrument. \n \nIn the instant case, the Campbells insist that it is impossible to determine from the face of the note the \namount due and payable on any payment date, as the note provides that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand. Consequently, say the Campbells, the note is not a negotiable instrument, as it does not \ncontain a promise to pay a “sum certain” [UCC 3-104(a)]. \n \nCenterre responds that the provision that interest may vary with bank rates charged to Strand is not \n“directory,” but instead is merely “discretionary.” The argument begs the question.

However, there are three important exceptions to this general rule: the imposter rule, the \nfictitious payee rule, and the dishonest employee rule. \n \nThe Imposter Rule \nIf one person poses as the named payee or as an agent of the named payee, inducing the maker or drawer \nto issue an instrument in the name of the payee to the imposter (or his confederate), the imposter’s \nindorsement of the payee’s name is effective.

When the check arrives, Wright \nindorses it by signing “Pay to the order of Richard Wright, (signed) Steve Supplier,” and then indorses it \nin his own name and cashes it. Love remains liable to Steve Supplier for the money that she owes him, and \nLove is out the $2,000 unless she can find Wright. \n \nThe difference between this case and the one involving the forger Carl Crooks is that in the second case \nthe imposter (Wright) “induced the maker or drawer [Lorna Love] to issue the instrument…by \nimpersonating the payee of the instrument [Steve Supplier]” (UCC, Section 3-404(a)), whereas in the first \ncase the thief did not induce Love to issue the check to him—he simply found it.

We’ll send your \norder to you by UPS.” He hands her a sample ball: it is substantial, and the price is good.

Accountant takes the check and indorses it: “Carlos Aquino, pay to the \norder of Abby Accountant.” Then she signs her name as the next indorser and cashes the check at Love’s \nbank. The check is good, even though it was never intended by Accountant that “Carlos Aquino”—\nthe fictitious payee—have any interest in the instrument. The theory here is to “place the loss on the \ndrawer of the check rather than on the drawee or the Depositary Bank that took the check for \ncollection.…The drawer is in the best position to avoid the fraud and thus should take the loss.” [3] This is \nalso known as “the padded-payroll rule.” \n \nIn the imposter cases, Love drew checks made out to real names but gave them to the wrong person (the \nimposter); in the fictitious payee cases she wrote checks to a nonexistent person (or a real person who was \nnot intended to have any interest at all). \nThe Dishonest Employee Rule",

It says that if an employer \n“entrust[s] an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person \nacting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement \nis effective.” [4] For example (adapted from UCC 3-405, Official Comment 3; the Comment does not use \nthe names of these characters, of course), the duties of Abby Accountant, a bookkeeper, include posting \nthe amounts of checks payable to Lorna Love to the accounts of the drawers of the checks. Accountant \nsteals a check payable to Love, which was entrusted to Accountant, and forges Love’s indorsement. The \ncheck is deposited by Accountant to an account in the depositary bank that Accountant opened in the \nsame name as Lorna Love, and the check is honored by the drawee bank. The indorsment is effective as \nLove’s indorsement because Accountant’s duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes. \nThus Accountant is entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check. Neither the depositary bank \nnor the drawee bank is liable to Love for conversion of the check. The same result would follow if \nAccountant deposited the check in the account in the depositary bank without indorsement (UCC, Section \n4-205(a)). Under Section 4-205(c), deposit in a depositary bank in an account in a name substantially \nsimilar to that of Lorna Love is the equivalent of an indorsement in the name of Lorna Love.

As \na result, the stamp and some checks are stolen; Love bears any loss for being negligent. Similarly liable is \na person who has had previous notice that his signature has been forged and has taken no steps to prevent \nreoccurrences, as is a person who negligently mails a check to the wrong person, one who has the same \nname as the payee.

This would ensure an additional control on checks that were \nlarger in amounts. Furthermore, Victory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each \nmonth. When any check was created by Victory’s computer system, the value of the check was \nautomatically assigned to a general ledger account before the check could be printed. The values in the \ngeneral ledger account could have been reconciled at the end of each month with the actual checks and \ninvoices.

A purchaser with knowledge \ncannot become an HDC. But proving knowledge is difficult, so the UCC at Section 3-302(2) lists several \ntypes of notice that presumptively defeat any entitlement to status as HDC. Notice is not limited to receipt \nof an explicit statement; it includes an inference that a person should have made from the circumstances. \nThe explicit things that give a person notice include those that follow. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Is Overdue \nThe UCC provides generally that a person who has notice that an instrument is overdue cannot be an \nHDC. What constitutes notice? When an inspection of the instrument itself would show that it was due \nbefore the purchaser acquired it, notice is presumed. A transferee to whom a promissory note due April \n23 is negotiated on April 24 has notice that it was overdue and consequently is not an HDC.

May Al collect? \n \nFigure 21.1 The Shelter Rule \n \n \nBegin the analysis by noting that Al is not an HDC. Why? For three reasons: he did not take the \ninstrument for value (it was a gift), he did not take in good faith (he knew of the fraud), and he had notice \n(he acquired it after the due date). Nevertheless, Al is entitled to collect from Harold the full $250,000. \nHis right to do so flows from UCC, Section 3-203(b): “Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the \ntransfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, \nincluding any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due \ncourse by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument.” \n \nBy virtue of the shelter rule, Al as transferee from Betsy acquires all rights that she had as transferor. \nClearly Betsy is an HDC: she paid for the instrument, she took it in good faith, had no notice of any claim \nor defense against the instrument, and there were no apparent irregularities. Since Betsy is an HDC, so is \nAl. His knowledge of the fraud does not undercut his rights as HDC because he was not a party to it and \nwas not a prior holder. Now suppose that after negotiating the instrument to Betsy, Clifford repurchased \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n861 \nit from her. He would not be an HDC—and would not acquire all Betsy’s rights—because he had been a \nparty to fraud and as a prior holder had notice of a defense. The purpose of the shelter rule is “to assure \nthe holder in due course a free market for the paper.”[2] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine is important because it allows the holder of a negotiable instrument to take \nthe paper free from most claims and defenses against it. Without the doctrine, such a holder would be a mere \ntransferee. The UCC provides that to be an HDC, a person must be a holder of paper that is not suspiciously \nirregular, and she must take it in good faith, for value, and without notice of anything that a reasonable \nperson would recognize as tainting the instrument.

As we have noted, though, negligence in the making or \nhandling of a negotiable instrument may cut off this defense against an HDC—as, for example, when a \ndrawer who uses a rubber signature stamp carelessly leaves it unattended. And notice, too, that Section 3-\n308 of the UCC provides that signatures are presumed valid unless their validity is specifically denied, at \nwhich time the burden shifts to the person claiming validity. These issues are discussed in Triffin v. \nSomerset Valley Bank, in Section 21.3 \"Cases\" of this chapter. \n \nBankruptcy \nDrawers, makers, and subsequent indorsers are not liable to an HDC if they have been discharged in \nbankruptcy. If they were, bankruptcy would not serve much purpose. \n \n \n \nInfancy \nWhether an infant’s signature on a negotiable instrument is a valid defense depends on the law of the \nstate. In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a \nparty. An alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration \nunless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration.

This result is intended even though the instrument was \nstolen from the issuer and completed after the theft.” A moral here: don’t leave instruments lying around \nwith blanks that could be filled in. \n \nVoid Contract \nA void contract is distinguished from a voidable contract; only the former is a real defense. \n \nFraud in the Execution \nYou may recall that this is the rather unusual situation in which a person is tricked into signing a \ndocument. Able holds out a piece of paper for her boss and points to the signature line, saying, “This is a \nreceipt for goods we received a little while ago.” Baker signs it. It is not a receipt; it’s the signature line on \na promissory note. Able has committed fraud in the execution, and the note is void. \n \nDischarge of Which the Holder Has Notice \nIf the holder knows that the paper—a note, say—has already been paid, she cannot enforce it. That’s a \ngood reason to take back any note you have made from the person who presents it to you for payment. \n \nConsumer Transactions and Holders in Due Course \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine often worked considerable hardship on the consumer, usually as the \nmaker of an installment note. \n \nFor example, a number of students are approached by a gym owner who induces them to sign one-year \npromissory notes for $150 for a one-year gym membership. The owner says, “I know that right now the \nequipment in the gym is pretty rudimentary, but then, too, $150 is about half what you’d pay at the YMCA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n866 \nor Gold’s Gym. And the thing is, as we get more customers signing up, we’re going to use the money to \ninvest in new equipment.

The factor takes \nas an apparent HDC, but the gym idea doesn’t work and the owner declares bankruptcy. If this were a \ncommercial transaction, the makers (the students) would still owe on the notes even if there was, as here, \na complete failure of consideration (called “paying on a dead horse”). But the students don’t have to pay. \n \nWhether the gym owner here committed fraud is uncertain, but the holder-in-due-course doctrine did \noften work to promote fraud. Courts frequently saw cases brought by credit companies (factors) against \nconsumers who bought machines that did not work and services that did not live up to their promises. The \nancient concept of an HDC did not square with the realities of modern commerce, in which instruments \nby the millions are negotiated for uncompleted transactions. The finance company that bought such \ncommercial paper could never have honestly claimed (in the sociological sense) to be wholly ignorant that \nmany makers will have claims against their payees (though they could and did make the claim in the legal \nsense). \n \nActing to curb abuses, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1976 promulgated a trade regulation rule \nthat in effect abolished the holder-in-due-course rule for consumer credit transactions. Under the FTC \nrule titled “Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses,” [3] the creditor becomes a mere holder and \nstands in the shoes of the seller, subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the \nseller. Specifically, the rule requires the seller to provide notice in any consumer credit contract that the \ndebtor is entitled to raise defenses against any subsequent purchaser of the paper. It also bars the seller \nfrom accepting any outside financing unless the loan contract between the consumer and the outside \nfinance company contains a similar notice. (The required notice, to be printed in no less than ten-point, \nboldface type, is set out in Figure 21.3 \"Notice of Defense\".) The effect of the rule is to ensure that a",

A consumer transaction is defined as a \npurchase of goods or services by a natural person, not a corporation or partnership, for personal, family, \nor household use from a seller in the ordinary course of business. [4] Purchases of goods or services for \ncommercial purposes and purchases of interests in real property, commodities, or securities are not \naffected. The rule applies to any credit extended by the seller himself (except for credit card transactions) \nor to any “purchase money loan.” This type of loan is defined as a cash advance to the consumer applied in \nwhole or substantial part to a purchase of goods or services from a seller who either (a) refers consumers \nto the creditor or (b) is affiliated with the creditor. The purpose of this definition is to prevent the seller \nfrom making an end run around the rule by arranging a loan for the consumer through an outside finance \ncompany. The rule does not apply to a loan that the consumer arranges with an independent finance \ncompany entirely on his own. \nThe net effect of the FTC rule is this: the holder-in-due-course doctrine is virtually dead in consumer \ncredit contracts. It remains alive and flourishing as a legal doctrine in all other business transactions. \n \nFigure 21.3 Notice of Defense \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe privileged position of the HDC stands up against the so-called personal defenses, which are—more or \nless—the same as typical defenses to obligation on any contract, not including, however, the real defenses. \nReal defenses are good against any holder, including an HDC.

Indeed, courts in other jurisdictions \ninterpreting similar language under section 3-303 have held that attorneys may be holders in due course \nonly to the extent that they have actually performed legal services prior to acquiring a negotiable \ninstrument. See [Citations: Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts]. We agree. \n \nThis retainer was a contract for future legal services.

Camp \n825 N.E.2d 644 (Ohio App. 2005) \n \nDonovan, J. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n872 \nDefendant-appellant Shawn Sheth appeals from a judgment of the Xenia Municipal Court in favor of \nplaintiff-appellee Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. (“Buckeye”). Sheth contends that the trial court erred in \nfinding that Buckeye was a holder in due course of a postdated check drawn by Sheth and therefore was \nentitled to payment on the instrument despite the fact that Sheth had issued a stop-payment order to his \nbank. \n \nIn support of this assertion, Sheth argues that the trial court did not use the correct legal standard in \ngranting holder-in-due-course status to Buckeye. In particular, Sheth asserts that the trial court used the \npre-1990 Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) definition of “good faith” as it pertains to holder-in-due-\ncourse status, which defined it as “honesty in fact.” The definition of “good faith” was extended by the \nauthors of the UCC in 1990 to also mean “the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair \ndealing.” The post-1990 definition was adopted by the Ohio legislature in 1994. \n \nSheth argues that while Buckeye would prevail under the pre-1990, “honesty in fact” definition of “good \nfaith,” it failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner when it chose to cash the postdated check \ndrawn by Sheth. The lower court…adjudged Buckeye to be a holder in due course and, therefore, entitled \nto payment. We conclude that the trial court used the incorrect “good faith” standard when it granted \nholder-in-due-course status to Buckeye because Buckeye did not act in a commercially reasonable manner \nwhen it cashed the postdated check drawn by Sheth. Because we accept Sheth’s sole assignment of error, \nthe judgment of the trial court is reversed. \n \nOn or about October 12, 2003, Sheth entered into negotiations with James A. Camp for Camp to provide \ncertain services to Sheth by October 15, 2003. To that end, Sheth issued Camp a check for $1,300. The \ncheck was postdated to October 15, 2003. \n \nOn October 13, 2003, Camp negotiated the check to Buckeye and received a payment of $1,261.31. \nApparently fearing that Camp did not intend to fulfill his end of the contract, Sheth contacted his bank on \nOctober 14, 2003, and issued a stop-payment order on the check. Unaware of the stop-payment order, \nBuckeye deposited the check with its own bank on October 14, 2003, believing that the check would reach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

[Citation] Under that standard, absent fraudulent behavior, an \notherwise innocent party was assumed to have acted in good faith. The “honesty in fact” requirement, also \nknown as the “pure heart and empty head” doctrine, is a subjective test under which a holder had to \nsubjectively believe he was negotiating an instrument in good faith for him to become a holder in due \ncourse. Maine [Citation, 1999]. \n \nIn 1994, however, the Ohio legislature amended the definition of “good faith” to include not only the \nsubjective “honesty in fact” test, but also an objective test: “the observance of reasonable commercial \nstandards of fair dealing.” Ohio UCC 1-201(20). A holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective \nand an objective test of good faith. What constitutes “reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing” for \nparties claiming holder-in-due-course status, however, has not heretofore been defined in the state of \nOhio. \n \nIn support of his contention that Buckeye is not a holder in due course, Sheth cites a decision from the \nSupreme Court of Maine, [referred to above] in which the court provided clarification with respect to the \nobjective prong of the “good faith” analysis: \n \n“The fact finder must therefore determine, first, whether the conduct of the holder comported with \nindustry or ‘commercial’ standards applicable to the transaction and second, whether those \nstandards were reasonable standards intended to result in fair dealing. Each of those \ndeterminations must be made in the context of the specific transaction at hand. If the fact finder’s \nconclusion on each point is ‘yes,’ the holder will be determined to have acted in good faith even if, \nin the individual transaction at issue, the result appears unreasonable.

In support of his summary judgment motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit from each \ncompany; each company swore that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any \nclaims or defenses by any party, without knowledge that any of the signatures on the checks were \nunauthorized or fraudulent, and with the expectation that the checks would be paid upon their \npresentment to the bank upon which the checks were drawn. Hauser Co. does not dispute any of the facts \nsworn to by the check cashing companies. \n \nThe checks were then transferred to plaintiff in accordance with section 3-303, vesting plaintiff with \nholder in due course status. Each company swore that it assigned the checks to plaintiff in exchange for \nconsideration received from plaintiff. Plaintiff thus acquired the check cashing companies’ holder in due \ncourse status when the checks were assigned to plaintiff. Moreover, pursuant to section 3-403(a)’s \nrequirement that the transfer must have been made for the purpose of giving the transferee the right to \nenforce the instrument, the assignment agreements expressly provided plaintiff with that right, stating \nthat “all payments [assignor] may receive from any of the referenced Debtors…shall be the exclusive \nproperty of [assignee].” Again, Hauser Co. does not dispute any facts relating to the assignment of the \nchecks to plaintiff. \n \nHauser Co. contends, instead, that the checks are per se invalid because they were fraudulent and \nunauthorized. Presumably, this argument is predicated on section 3-302. This section states a person is \nnot a holder in due course if the instrument bears “apparent evidence of forgery or alteration” or is \notherwise “so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.” \n \nIn order to preclude liability from a holder in due course under section 3-302, it must be apparent on the \nface of the instrument that it is fraudulent. The trial court specifically found that Hauser Co. had provided \nno such evidence, stating that Hauser Co. had failed to show that there was anything about the \nappearance of the checks to place the check cashing company on notice that any check was not valid. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org",

Why did the plaintiff, Mr. Triffin, obtain possession of the dishonored checks? Regarding the plaintiff, \nconsider this:http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nj-supreme-court/1332248.html. \n2. Section 4-401 of the UCC says nobody is liable on an instrument unless the person signed it, and Section 4-\n403(a) provides that “an unauthorized signature is ineffective” (except as the signature of the unauthorized \nperson), so how could Hauser Co. be liable at all? And why did the court never discuss plaintiff’s contention \nthat the defendant “was negligent in failing to safeguard both its payroll checks and its authorized drawer’s \nfacsimile stamp”? \n3. Why didn’t the Hauser Co. specifically deny the authenticity of the signatures? \n4. Obviously, the plaintiff must have known that there was something wrong with the checks when he bought \nthem from the check-cashing companies: they had been dishonored and were marked “Stolen, do not \npresent again.” Did he present them again? \n5. While the UCC does not require that the transferee of an instrument acted in good faith in order to collect \non the instrument as an HDC (though he can’t have participated in any scam), it disallows a person from \nbeing an HDC if he takes an instrument with notice of dishonor. Surely the plaintiff had notice of that. What \ndoes the UCC require that transformed Mr. Triffin—via the shelter rule—into a person with the rights of an \nHDC? \n6.

For example, Igor is an agent (treasurer) of Frank N. Stein, Inc. Igor signs a note showing that \nthe corporation has borrowed $50,000 from First Bank. The company later becomes bankrupt. The \nquestion: Is Igor personally liable on the note?

The drafters of the UCC here punt to the common law of agency: if, under agency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n891 \nlaw, the principal would be bound by the act of the agent, the signature is the authorized signature of the \nprincipal. And the general rule in agency law is that the agent is not liable if he signs his own name and \nmakes clear he is doing so as an agent. In our example, Igor should sign as follows: “Frank N. Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.” \n \nThe UCC provides that in each case, the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the \ninstrument without notice that the agent wasn’t intended to be liable on the instrument. As to any other \nperson (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she proves that the original parties to the \ninstrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Section 3-402(c) says that, as to a check, if an agent signs \nhis name without indicating agency status but the check has the principal’s identification on it (that would \nbe in the upper left corner), the authorized agent is not liable. \n \nLiability of an “Agent” Who Has No Authority to Sign \nA person who has no authority to sign an instrument cannot really be an “agent” because by definition an \nagent is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing with",

Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES",

The UCC makes giving notice pretty easy: it permits any party who may be compelled to pay the \ninstrument to notify any party who may be liable on it (but each person who is to be charged with liability \nmust actually be notified); notice of dishonor may “be given by any commercially reasonable means \nincluding an oral, written, or electronic communication”; and no specific form of notice is required—it is \n“sufficient if it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument has been \ndishonored or has not been paid or accepted.” [11] Section 3-503(c) sets out time limits when notice of \ndishonor must be given for collecting banks and for other persons.

Moreover, a waiver of presentment is also a waiver of notice of dishonor. Delay in \ngiving the notice is excused, too, if it is caused by circumstances beyond the control of the person giving \nnotice and she exercised reasonable diligence when the cause of delay stopped.

Understand how the obligations represented by commercial paper may be discharged. \n \n \nOverview \nNegotiable instruments eventually die. The obligations they represent are discharged (terminated) in two \ngeneral ways: (1) according to the rules stated in Section 3-601 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or \n(2) by an act or agreement that would discharge an obligation to pay money under a simple contract (e.g., \ndeclaring bankruptcy). \n \nDischarge under the Uniform Commercial Code \nThe UCC provides a number of ways by which an obligor on an instrument is discharged from liability, \nbut notwithstanding these several ways, under Section 3-601, no discharge of any party provided by the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n908 \nrules presented in this section operates against a subsequent holder in due course unless she has notice \nwhen she takes the instrument. \n \nDischarge in General \nDischarge by Payment \nA person primarily liable discharges her liability on an instrument to the extent of payment by paying or \notherwise satisfying the holder, and the discharge is good even if the payor knows that another has claim \nto the instrument. However, discharge does not operate if the payment is made in bad faith to one who \nunlawfully obtained the instrument (and UCC Section 3-602(b) lists two other exceptions). \n \n \n \nDischarge by Tender \nA person who tenders full payment to a holder on or after the date due discharges any subsequent liability \nto pay interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees (but not liability for the face amount of the instrument). If the \nholder refuses to accept the tender, any party who would have had a right of recourse against the party \nmaking the tender is discharged. Mario makes a note payable to Carol, who indorses it to Ed. On the date \nthe payment is due, Mario (the maker) tenders payment to Ed, who refuses to accept the payment; he \nwould rather collect from Carol. Carol is discharged: had she been forced to pay as indorser in the event of \nMario’s refusal, she could have looked to him for recourse. Since Mario did tender, Ed can no longer look \nto Carol for payment. [1] \n \nDischarge by Cancellation and Renunciation",

[1] \n \nDischarge by Cancellation and Renunciation \nThe holder may discharge any party, even without consideration, by marking the face of the instrument or \nthe indorsement in an unequivocal way, as, for example, by intentionally canceling the instrument or the \nsignature by destruction or mutilation or by striking out the party’s signature. The holder may also \nrenounce his rights by delivering a signed writing to that effect or by surrendering the instrument itself. [2] \n \nDischarge by Material and Fraudulent Alteration \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n909 \nUnder UCC Section 3-407, if a holder materially and fraudulently alters an instrument, any party whose \ncontract is affected by the change is discharged. A payor bank or drawee paying a fraudulently altered \ninstrument or a person taking it for value, in good faith, and without notice of the alteration, may enforce \nrights with respect to the instrument according to its original terms or, if the incomplete instrument was \naltered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed. \n• \nExample 1: Marcus makes a note for $100 payable to Pauline. Pauline fraudulently raises the \namount to $1,000 without Marcus’s negligence and negotiates it to Ned, who qualifies as a holder \nin due course (HDC). Marcus owes Ned $100. \n• \nExample 2: Charlene writes a check payable to Lumber Yard and gives it to Contractor to buy \nmaterial for a deck replacement. Contractor fills it in for $1,200: $1,000 for the decking and $200 \nfor his own unauthorized purposes. Lumber Yard, if innocent of any wrongdoing, could enforce \nthe check for $1,200, and Charlene must go after Contractor for the $200. \n \nDischarge by Certification \nAs we have noted, where a drawee certifies a draft for a holder, the drawer and all prior indorsers are \ndischarged. \n \nDischarge by Acceptance Varying a Draft \nIf the holder assents to an acceptance varying the terms of a draft, the obligation of the drawer and any \nindorsers who do not expressly assent to the acceptance is discharged.

The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card. More consumers now have debit cards than credit cards (80.2 percent versus 78.3 \npercent), and consumers use debit cards more often than cash, credit cards, or checks \nindividually.

Two terms are used to describe the various banks that may handle \nthe check after it is written: collecting banks and intermediary banks.

On Wednesday the \ncheck is good for Matthew (he may have been given “provisional credit” before then, as discussed below, \nthe bank could subtract the money from his account if Roger didn’t have enough to cover the check). \n \nCollection Process between Customers of Different Banks \nRoger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A.

Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n947 \n \nPayment of Deceased’s or Incompetent’s Checks \nSuppose a customer dies or is adjudged to be incompetent. May the bank honor her checks? Section 4-405 \npermits banks to accept, pay, and collect an item as long as it has no notice of the death or declaration of \nincompetence, and has no reasonable opportunity to act on it. Even after notice of death, a bank has ten \ndays to payor certify checks drawn on or prior to the date of death unless someone claiming an interest in \nthe account orders it to refrain from doing so. \n \n \n \nStop Payment Orders \nSection 4-403 expressly permits the customer to order the bank to “stop payment” on any check payable \nfor her account, assuming the stop order arrives in enough time to reasonably permit the bank to act on it. \nAn oral stop order is effective for fourteen days; a follow-up written confirmation within that time is \neffective for six months and can be renewed in writing.

The bank’s liability is limited to the damages \nactually proved; these may include damages for arrest and prosecution. See Section 23.4 \"Cases\" under \n“Bank’s Liability for Paying over Customer’s ‘Stop Payment’ Order” (Meade v. National Bank of Adams \nCounty). \n \nCustomers’ Duties \nIn order to hold a bank liable for paying out an altered check, the customer has certain duties under \nSection 4-406. Primarily, the customer must act promptly in examining her statement of account and \nmust notify the bank if any check has been altered or her signature has been forged. If the customer fails \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n948 \nto do so, she cannot recover from the bank for an altered signature or other term if the bank can show that \nit suffered a loss because of the customer’s slowness. Recovery may also be denied when there has been a \nseries of forgeries and the customer did not notify the bank within two weeks after receiving the first \nforged item. See Section 23.4 \"Cases\" under “Customer’s Duty to Inspect Bank Statements” (the Planters \nBank v. Rogers case). \n \nThese rules apply to a payment made with ordinary care by the bank. If the customer can show that the \nbank negligently paid the item, then the customer may recover from the bank, regardless of how dilatory \nthe customer was in notifying the bank—with two exceptions: (1) from the time she first sees the \nstatement and item, the customer has one year to tell the bank that her signature was unauthorized or \nthat a term was altered, and (2) she has three years to report an unauthorized indorsement. \n \nThe Expedited Funds Availability Act \nIn General \nIn addition to UCC Article 4 (again, state law), the federal Expedited Funds Availability Act—also referred \nto as “Regulation CC” after the Federal Reserve regulation that implements it—addresses an aspect of the \nrelationship between a bank and its customers.

Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows.",

(3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows. \n \n1. Proof of transaction. The electronic terminal itself must be equipped to provide a receipt of transfer, \nshowing date, amount, account number, and certain other information. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe bank or other financial institution must provide you with a monthly statement listing all \nelectronic transfers to and from the account, including transactions made over the computer or \ntelephone, and must show to whom payment has been made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n954 \n2. Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation. \n3. Recourse for loss or theft. If you notify the issuer of your EFT card within two business days after \nlearning that your card (or code number) is missing or stolen, your liability is limited to $50. If you \nfail to notify the issuer in this time, your liability can go as high as $500. More daunting is the \nprospect of loss if you fail within sixty days to notify the financial institution of an unauthorized \ntransfer noted on your statement: after sixty days of receipt, your liability is unlimited. In other \nwords, a thief thereafter could withdraw all your funds and use up your line of credit and you would \nhave no recourse against the financial institution for funds withdrawn after the sixtieth day, if you \nfailed to notify it of the unauthorized transfer. \n4. Mandatory use of EFT. Your employer or a government agency can compel you to accept a salary \npayment or government benefit by electronic transfer. But no creditor can insist that you repay",

The book is\ndesigned for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as\nsecond-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences\nand course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the\nintroduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and\nPreface\n1\neconomics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial\ntheory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more\nrigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical\ncalculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.\nPedagogical Foundation\nPrinciples of Finance emphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business\nfunctions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates\na unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This\nmultifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.\nTheoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are\nintroduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.\nIn order to create meaning for all students, Principles of Finance exposes them to a range of companies,\nindustries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,\nand American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that\nmay be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,\nsmall business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews\ninclude diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.\nProblems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and\ncontexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice.

TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position.

For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to",

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm",

Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services.

Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations. Who can run the country’s economic\nsystem better, Republicans or Democrats? Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic\nperformance even though their actual influence is less than you might think. See this fun comparison chart\n(https://openstax.org/r/macrotrends-net) of political economic performance that measures stock market\nreturns by each administration going back to President Warren Harding in 1920. Who had the highest\noverall increase in the market? What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?\nJust to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, Donald Trump or\nBarack Obama?\nEach of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock\nmarket, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs. Toss in\na pandemic, and a bottleneck or two, and suddenly international macroeconomic factors can affect almost\nevery aspect of commerce and international trade.\n24\n1 • Introduction to Finance",

The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\nmaturity of the NCD.

The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest\npayments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes.

A corporation often\nissues bonds for longer-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline\nthe rules for the order, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or\nmore of the required activities lapse. A bond contract, known as an indenture, includes both standard\n“boilerplate” contract language and specific conditions unique to a particular issue.

However, data today is more\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\nfor their stakeholders.\n1.4 Careers in Finance\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\nto manufacturing, to education.\n1.5 Markets and Participants\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources.

Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing.

Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners.

This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.",

For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\nfavorable growth opportunities.\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid.

More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors. It also set a requirement that the SEC issue new rulings that establish compliance with the act.\nBoard of Directors Oversight and Corporate Governance\nBecause of the widely publicized control breakdowns at Wells Fargo Bank and recent regulatory actions,\nboards of directors of public companies and financial institutions have been directed to improve oversight and\n2\nScott Vogel. “You Paid for It: AIG’s Retreat Destination, Up Close.” Washington Post.

As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be\nresolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.\nEvery company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and\npersonal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders\n(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own\nwealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the\ngoodwill of the shareholder base.\nThere are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nExample of an Agency Problem\nABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the\nselling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own\npersonal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price\nof the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.\nAdditionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall\nquality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced\nbetween stockholders and loyal customers of the company.\nStockholders versus Management\nLarge corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential\nfor an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type\nof agency problem.\nSegregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not\nhave any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts\nand professionals to manage key operations of the business.\nHowever, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.\nExternal managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even\n50\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmisusing company funds.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\nsaves money.\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\nacting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent\noversight.\nBernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\nhad been newly invested.\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\n(Sources: Diana B.

While\nsuch organizations may import raw materials and supplies from other nations or end up exporting their\nfinished products to other countries around the world, in the end, these international activities represent only\na very small portion of their overall business activities.\nDomestic companies are typically governed by US accounting and securities laws that have been established\nby the SEC. Further, financial reporting for these domestic organizations is to be completed using Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).",

Further, financial reporting for these domestic organizations is to be completed using Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\nInternational firms, while based in the United States, will typically maintain significant levels of international\ninvestment and conduct operations that may be quite diverse, both geographically and culturally. For such\ninternational firms, parent company accounting will usually adhere to GAAP standards. Conversely, non-US\nsubsidiaries of such international firms may be regulated by laws dictated by their host countries. These will\noften differ significantly from those in the United States.\nIn recent years, accounting regulations in countries outside the United States have come under the jurisdiction\nof International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It should be noted that guidelines and regulations under\nIFRS and those under GAAP can differ significantly. As a result of these regulatory differences, any specific\ndivergences in accounting or governance practices between foreign subsidiaries and a US parent company\nshould be clearly stated and disclosed in the parent company’s financial reports.\nGlobal firms have substantial operations and investments in different countries (global markets), and they\nmay have no single center or basis of operational activity. In such cases, regulations for corporate governance\nare usually determined by the laws of the country in which the parent company has been established. While\nthere are some global firms that report their financial statements according to GAAP standards, usually to\nsatisfy the informational needs of US investors, most global parent companies’ financials will adhere to IFRS\nreporting standards.\nDifference in Financial Reporting: GAAP versus IFRS\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were\ndesigned with similar objectives in mind: to provide a common and structured set of guidelines to assist in the\npreparation of accurate and unbiased financial reporting for public corporations.\nYet despite these commonalities in purpose, there are important differences between them.

Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).\nLet’s consider what the demand for pizza might look like. Suppose that at a price of $30 per pizza, no one will\npurchase a pizza, but if the price of a pizza is $25, 10 people might buy a pizza. If the price falls even lower,\nmore pizzas will be purchased, as shown in Table 3.1.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n0\n25\n10\n20\n20\n15\n30\n10\n40\n5\n50\nTable 3.1 Demand\nSchedule for Pizza\nThe information in Table 3.1 can be viewed in the form of a graph, as in Figure 3.2. Economists refer to the line\nin Figure 3.2 as a demand curve. When plotting a demand curve, price is placed on the vertical axis, and\nquantity is placed on the horizontal axis. Because more pizzas are bought at lower prices than at higher prices,\nthis demand curve is downward sloping. This inverse relationship is referred to as the law of demand.\n68\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 3.2 Demand Curve for Pizzas\nThe inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of a good sold occurs for two reasons.\nFirst, as you consume more and more pizza, the amount of happiness that one more pizza will bring you\ndiminishes. If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\npurchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing.

This is\nknown as an increase in demand. Now, at a price of $25, people will purchase 19 pizzas instead of 10; and at a\nprice of $15, people will purchase 39 pizzas instead of 30.\nFigure 3.3 An Increase in Demand Represented as a Movement of the Demand Curve to the Right\nA decrease in demand would cause the demand curve to move to the left. This could happen if people’s tastes\nand preferences changed. If there were, for example, increased publicity about pizza being an unhealthy food\nchoice, some individuals would choose healthier alternatives and consume less pizza.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDemand Curve Shifts\nIf any of the items that are assumed not to change when a demand curve is drawn do change, then the\ndemand curve can shift. To learn more about these changes in demand, watch the MRU video on demand\ncurve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video).\nSupply\nSupply is the quantity of a good or service that firms are willing to sell at various prices, during a given time\nperiod, ceteris paribus. Table 3.3 is a fictional example of a supply schedule for pizzas. In some cases, higher\nprices encourage producers to provide more of their product for sale. Thus, there is a positive relationship\nbetween the price and quantity supplied.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n60\n25\n50\n20\n40\n15\n30\n10\n20\n5\n10\nTable 3.3 Supply\nSchedule for Pizzas\n70\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Relevant economic factors would include consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price of other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza night for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase. If the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher.

You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n77\ndelivery from an online retailer. Although keeping the items in the market basket constant allows\neconomists to focus on price changes, the market basket quickly becomes outdated and does not reflect a\ntypical family’s purchases.\nIn an attempt to provide new measures of inflation that better represent the changing basket of goods\npurchased and the purchasing habits of families, Alberto Cavallo and Roberto Rigobon founded the Billion\nPrices Project. Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world. The Billion Prices Project website\n(https://openstax.org/r/billion-prices-project) provides measures for inflation using this data as well as\nresearch papers regarding macroeconomic research.\nHistorical Trends in the Inflation Rate\nInflation, as measured by the CPI for 1947–2020, is displayed in Figure 3.10. The graph shows that for the past\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.",

Employment expands as businesses produce more;\nconversely, unemployment falls. Other measures of economic growth may include increased new business\nstarts and new home construction. The economy is said to be “heating up.” As the expansion continues,\ninflation often becomes a concern.\n7\nData from US Bureau of Economic Analysis. “Gross Domestic Product (GDP).” FRED.

Eventually, growth slows and unemployment rises. The\neconomy has moved from expansion to contraction when this occurs. The point at which the business cycle\nturns from expansion to contraction is known as the peak. The point at which the contraction ends and the\neconomy begins to expand again is known as the trough. The length of one business cycle is measured by the\ntime from one trough to the trough of the next cycle, as shown in Figure 3.15.\nFigure 3.15 Stages of the Business Cycle\nOften, the contraction is referred to as a recession. A private think tank, the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch (NBER), tracks the business cycle in the United States. The NBER is the entity that officially declares\nrecessions in the United States. Historically, a recession was defined as two consecutive quarters of declining\nGDP. Today, the NBER defines a recession in a broader, less precise manner; it will declare a recession when\nthere is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts for at least a few\nmonths.8 Measures of real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale and retail sales are\nconsidered in addition to real GDP.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research was founded in 1920 to create measures of economic activity\nthat could be used in public policy discussions.

If you want to borrow money to purchase a\ncar and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.\nOr suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation.

A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort.

In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example.

First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\ndegree pursued.\nSolution:\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization.

Likewise, when a business provides goods or services to customers for cash at the time\nof the service or in the future, the business classifies the amount(s) as revenue. Just as the $1,400 revenues\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as\nearning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or\npayments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar\nvalue of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCoffee Shop Products\nThink about a coffee shop in your area. Identify items the coffee shop sells that would be classified as\nrevenues. Remember, revenues for the coffee shop are related to its primary purpose: selling coffee and\nrelated items. Or, better yet, make a trip to the local coffee shop and get a first-hand experience.\nSolution:\nMany coffee shops earn revenue through multiple revenue streams, including coffee and other specialty\ndrinks, food items, gift cards, and merchandise.\nShort-Term Revenue Recognition Examples\nTwo brief examples may help illustrate the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting.\nAssume that a business sells $200 worth of merchandise. In some businesses, there are two ways the\ncustomers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards\nand are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer\nto take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.\nA cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of\naccounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the\nsame time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nA credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash\nbasis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,\nunder terms stipulated by the seller. For example, assume that in the next year of Chris’s landscaping\nbusiness, on April 1, she provides $500 worth of services to one of her customers. The sale is made on account,",

Although\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until\ncustomer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you\nrecognize revenue?\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\ngovernment.\nExpense Recognition\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers.

For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash.

It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other",

It represents the firm’s cash and cash equivalents divided by current liabilities and is a\nmore conservative look at a firm’s liquidity than the current or quick ratios. The ratio is reflected as a number,\nnot a percentage. A cash ratio of 1.0 means the firm has enough cash to cover all current liabilities if\nsomething happened and it was required to pay all current debts immediately. A ratio of less than 1.0 means\nthe firm has more current liabilities than it has cash on hand. A ratio of more than 1.0 means it has enough\ncash on hand to pay all current liabilities and still have cash left over. While a ratio greater than 1.0 may sound\nideal, it’s important to consider the specifics of the company. Sitting on idle cash is not ideal, as the cash could\nbe used to earn a return. And having a ratio less than 1.0 isn’t always bad, as many firms operate quite\nsuccessfully with a ratio of less than 1.0.

In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value\ntomorrow.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will\npay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year\nfrom now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\nturns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is\n$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that\ntime. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the\nprincipal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\nBy taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a\ntotal value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to\n$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that\n$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss\ninterest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can\nconsider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds\nand/or charged to the borrower of these same funds.

In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n.

We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,\nlet’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because\nwe’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a\nlarger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to\nstart compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as\nfollows:\nWhether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger\nthan that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\norder of operations:\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\namount.\nWe notice several things:\n1.\nThe formula must change because the annual payment is subtracted first, prior to the calculation of\nannual interest.\n2.\nWe accomplish the same result, aside from an insignificant rounding difference: the fund is depleted once\nthe last payment is withdrawn.\n3.\nThe last payment is withdrawn on the first day of the final year, not the last.

Therefore, the amount only\ncompounds for four years rather than five. Also, our fifth payment is not made until the last day of our\ncontract in year 5, so it has no chance to earn a compounded future value. The investor has lost on both ends.\nIn the table above, we have made five calculations, and for a longer-term contract such as 10, 25, or 40 years,\nthis would be tedious. Fortunately, as with present values, this ordinary annuity can be solved in one step\nbecause all payments are identical.\nRepeating the formula, and then by substitution:\nThis proof emphasizes that year 1 is wasted, with no compounding because the payment is made on the last\nday of year 1 rather than immediately. We lose compounding through this ordinary annuity in another way:\nyear 5’s investment is made on the last day of this five-year contract and has no chance to accumulate interest.\nA more intuitive method would be to enter a contract for an annuity due so that our first payment can be\nmade immediately. In this way, we don’t waste the first year, and all five payments work in year 5 as well. As\nstated previously, this means that annuities due will yield larger results than ordinary annuities, whether one is\ndiscounting (PVa) or compounding (FVa).\nLet’s hold all facts constant with the previous example, except that we will invest at the beginning of each year,\nstarting immediately upon locking in this five-year contract. We follow the same technique as in the present\nvalue section: we multiply by one additional period to convert this ordinary annuity factor into a factor for an\nannuity due. Whether one is solving for a future value or a present value, the result of an annuity due must\nalways be larger than an ordinary annuity. With future value, we begin investing immediately, so the result will\nbe larger than if we waited for a period to elapse. With present value, we begin extracting funds immediately\nrather than letting them work for us during the first year, so logically we would have to start with more.",

If you can earn a 5% annual rate of interest, how much will you have if you\nbegin at age 20? What if you delay this program until age 30? The additional 10 years can make a\nsurprisingly large difference. How can you calculate that difference?\nSolution:\nPerform two separate calculations comparable to the chapter examples above, using the formula for the\nfuture value of an ordinary annuity. You plan to make the first investment immediately, making this an\nannuity due, so you will multiply by one additional period, (1 + 0.05). Notice that the only difference\nbetween the two calculations is the exponent N, representing the number of periods.\nThirty years (starting at age 30):\nForty years (starting at age 20):\nWaiting 10 years before committing to this program comes with a surprisingly high cost—a loss of almost\n82% of the potential value.\nHow Annuities Are Used for Retirement Planning\nOn a final note, how might annuities be used for retirement planning? A person might receive a lump-sum\nwindfall from an investment, and rather than choosing to accept the proceeds, they might decide to invest the\nsum (ignoring taxes) in an annuity. Their intention is to let this invested sum produce annual distributions to\nsupplement Social Security payments. Assume the recipient just received $75,000, again ignoring tax effects.",

If that check has insufficient\nfunds, more fees and penalties will likely be assessed.\nOne primary reason that arrangements such as these are controversial is the excessively high nominal (stated)\ninterest rate that they can represent.

These loans allow you to\ndetermine your April 15 personal income tax liability through a preparer and receive an advance against\nyour expected refund.2 But beware: your ability to analyze the true cost of money is always critical. Like all\nloans, RALs bear a rate of interest. Let’s assume that the firm that prepared your tax return determines that\nyou’re entitled to an $800 refund. Once they advance that amount to you, it will bear interest at a certain\nrate; we’ll assume 0.5% per week. You might expect a tax refund in four weeks. Half a percent of $800\ndoesn’t sound like much, but what happens when you annualize it into an effective rate, assuming your tax\nrefund arrives exactly four weeks from when you accept the loan? Assume no compounding during those\nfour weeks.\nSolution:\nA weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use\nof $800. Of course, that totals 2% of the amount advanced. There are 13 four-week periods in a year, so\neven though the interest rate appears to be small, it amounts to 26% when annualized! We assumed no\ncompounding to keep the illustration simple, but we further assume that you are not using this advance\nthroughout the year. If you were, then periodic compounding would drive the effective rate even higher, to\njust over 29.3%.\n1",

These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING",

The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate.

At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments\nconstitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.\nThe principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount\nis a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.\nIn Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments.

Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks.

This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\noriginal bond investors.\n•\nTerm risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all.

However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond.

In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political\nmovement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets.

When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they",

The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the\ndenominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.\nAnalyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when\na company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry\nthat it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as\nwhether a stock that has a ratio of\nis a good buy at its current price or if a stock with a P/E ratio of\nis\ntoo expensive, without performing any relevant comparisons or further analysis.\nAnalysts have many different ways to interpret P/E ratio data. One of the most common interpretations is that\nfirms with high P/E ratios should be growth companies. Also, a high P/E ratio could mean that a stock’s price is\nhigh relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. This could signal a possible undesired downward\nadjustment in market price in the future.\nWe can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be\nstabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to\nearnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential\ninvestment gains through stock price appreciation.\nWhile this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution\nmust always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,\nwhich would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term.

When such complex\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses.

Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their\ncommon stock:\nEV/Revenue (EV/R). Also called EV/Sales, EV/R is a valuation metric used to understand a company’s total\nvaluation compared to its annual sales levels. EV/R can help provide an analyst with an idea of exactly how\nmuch investors pay for every dollar of a company’s sales revenue.\nEV/R is considered a relatively crude metric but can be useful when analyzing companies that have different\nmethods of revenue recognition. P/E ratios, for example, can be significantly affected by changes in the\naccounting policies of companies being evaluated. This is another reason why multiple metrics should be used\nin valuations.\nAdditionally, EV/R is a useful measure for companies that are consuming cash or experiencing financial losses.\nSuch companies may be start-ups or emerging technology firms that have not fully matured and are still in a\ngrowth stage of development.\nEV/EBIT.

Another form of valuation based on enterprise value is EV/EBITDAR. This metric divides\nenterprise value by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rental costs (EBITDAR).\nThis multiple is used in businesses that have substantial rental and lease expenses, such as hotel chains\nand airlines. Capital investment can differ significantly for these firms, and when assets are leased, these\ncompanies tend to have artificially lower debt and operating income compared to firms that actually own\ntheir assets.\nEV/Capital Employed. The EV-to-capital employed ratio is a measure of enterprise value compared to the\nlevel of capital used by a business. For example, a business with a large capital basis is bound to carry a large\nenterprise value simply due to its large capital holdings.\nFinal Thoughts on Valuation Ratios and Multiples\nThere are many equity and enterprise value multiples used in company valuation, but the discussions above\ncover those that are most commonly used. In any case, gaining a thorough understanding of each multiple\nand its related concepts can help analysts make better use of these metrics in their stock analysis and\nvaluation efforts.

The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward.

Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills.

T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of\n20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8\ntrillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.\nIn 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument, Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once\nper month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the\nsecurity and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts\nmonthly in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of\nthe principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a\ntotal outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury\nborrowing we have discussed.3\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (munis). Local\nborrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,\nmunis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on\nthe perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-\nfree. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\nThere are two primary types of municipal bonds: revenue bonds and general obligation (GO) bonds.

Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\ncost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade\nbonds.

For corporations, shares of stock\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock.

Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The largest company by sales\nvolume in 2020 was Walmart.7\nGeographical Location of Exchanges\nOwnership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in an over-\nthe-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly\nadapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a\nbroker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors\nare always able to buy or sell their stocks.

The\ninvestment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue,\nand establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see\nFigure 12.3).

Taking a more informed and opposing view, financial economist\nJeremy Siegel queries, “You have never lost money in stocks over any 20-year period, but you have wiped out\nhalf your portfolio in bonds (after inflation). So which is the riskier asset?”14 Siegel brings up a valid point\nabout inflation. Returns adjusted for changes in prices provide a better measure of value or wealth. Baseball\npundit Sam Ewing noted, “Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten-dollar haircut you used to get\nfor five dollars when you had hair.”15 If what you have earned on your investments fails to keep up with\nchanging prices, you may have a larger portfolio with less purchasing power.\nExpected versus Actual Inflation\nInflation occurs when things cost more and your money buys less today than it did yesterday. It is\nunderstandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the\nprimary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.\nHowever, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others\nat the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical\nevidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that\nmatch the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are\nwilling to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation\nexceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the\nloan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate. Lenders, however, receive those\ninflation-impacted dollars and are harmed due to their unexpected decrease in purchasing power.\nDeflation, or falling prices, is associated with economic recessions or even depressions and is thought to be an\neven more serious problem than inflation. Generally, policy makers tend to support moderate inflation, being\ncareful to stay away from zero or negative price changes.\n14\nJeremy J. Siegel.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average. For the selected items presented\nhere, only the average price for used cars and trucks rose at a rate significantly lower than the average rate of\ninflation.\nYear\n1980 2000 2020 Annual Change\nCollege tuition and fees\n70.8 331.9 877.3\n6.49%\nRent\n80.9 183.9 341.5\n3.67%\nUsed cars and trucks\n62.3 155.8 144.2\n2.12%\nGround beef\n104.6 125.2 296.2\n2.64%\nButter\n89.4 135.9 248.7\n2.59%\nCPI (1982 to 1984 = 100)\n82.4 172.2 258.8\n2.90%\nTable 12.3 Changing Consumer Price Levels—Selected Goods (source:\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index)\nUsing Graphs and Charts to Plot Inflation Behavior\nThe CPI is a measure of how prices have changed for a basket of goods across the United States.

After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, Yellen later\nattended Yale University and was the only woman in her 1971 PhD graduating class in economics. Men have\nlong dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.\nMotivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen\nrealized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary\npeople. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record. During her four-year tenure, the rate of unemployment\ndecreased by more than 2.5%, and employment increased in every month of her term.

He was uncanny in his ability to estimate future prices, interest\nrates, and macroeconomic conditions to make profitable investments.\nHowever, as efficient markets would posit, the odds began to catch up with Gross in the latter part of his\ninvesting career. After leaving Pimco in 2014, Gross was unable to match his earlier performance successes\nand failed to beat bond fund performance averages. Much of Gross’s investment strategy allowed him to\nlook for bond returns by investing in any type of bond, with any maturity, in any country, and in any\nlocation. For decades, he was right more often than wrong in his investment choices. However, statistically,\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\n369\nhis approach to investing suggested that, unless he could see the future, at some point his expectations\nwould be incorrect. Perhaps Gross’s greatest competition comes from a generation of investment\nmanagers who learned and improved upon his proven strategies. He retired as an active public fund\nmanager in 2019.\nToday, Gross continues to manage his personal fortune, as well as the assets in his family charitable\nfoundation. Gross and the foundation have donated over $800 million to several causes over the last two\ndecades. In 2020, Gross joined Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and hundreds of other billionaires in signing the\nGiving Pledge, whose signees promise to donate over 50% of their wealth during their lifetime and/or upon\ntheir death.\n(Sources: Mary Childs. “Bill Gross Made the Bond Market What It Is Today.” Barron’s.

Both indices\ntrack the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies.

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\nStocks have produced the greatest average annual rates of return of the money and capital market assets\ndiscussed in this chapter. Stockholders bear more risk than bondholders or money market investors and\nreceive on average higher average annual returns. Despite the relatively high average annual rate of return for\nportfolios of stock, history shows that the equity markets earn negative annual returns about 25% of the time.\nThe negative returns realized by equities occur far more often than the negative results realized by money\nmarket or debt market instruments.\nKey Terms\nbond returns\nsums the periodic interest payments and the change in bond price in a given period and\ndivides by the bond price at the beginning of the period\ncommercial paper (CP)\na short-term, unsecured security issued by corporations and financial institutions to\nmeet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables\ndebenture\na common type of unsecured bond issued by a corporation\nindenture\nlegal term for a bond contract\ninflation",

Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\nSolution:\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\n$5,000,000.\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\nset.\n13.1 • Measures of Center\n383\nMode\nAnother measure of center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one\nmode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data\nset with two modes is called bimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology\nstock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:\nTo find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this\ndata set is 72. It is helpful to know that the most common closing price of this particular stock over the past 20\nweeks has been $72.00.\nGeometric Mean\nThe arithmetic mean, median, and mode are all measures of the center of a data set, or the average. They are\nall, in their own way, trying to measure the common point within the data—that which is “normal.” In the case\nof the arithmetic mean, this is accomplished by finding the value from which all points are equal linear\ndistances. We can imagine that all the data values are combined through addition and then distributed back to\neach data point in equal amounts.\nThe geometric mean redistributes not the sum of the values but their product. It is calculated by multiplying\nall the individual values and then redistributing them in equal portions such that the total product remains the\nsame. This can be seen from the formula for the geometric mean, x̃ (pronounced x-tilde):\nThe geometric mean is relevant in economics and finance for dealing with growth—of markets, in investments,\nand so on. For an example of a finance application, assume we would like to know the equivalent percentage\ngrowth rate over a five-year period, given the yearly growth rates for the investment.",

The bars can be\nrectangles, or they can be rectangular boxes (used in three-dimensional plots), and they can be vertical or\nhorizontal. The bar graph shown in the example below has age groups represented on the x-axis and\nproportions on the y-axis.\nBy the end of 2021, a certain social media site had over 146 million users in the United States.

One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,\nQ3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles\ndivide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.\n13.4 Statistical Distributions\nA frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to\norganize and tabulate the data in a summarized way. Once a frequency distribution is generated, it can be\nused to create graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set.

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y.

The expected value method assumes that the experiment\nis conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method.

There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation. As the value of x gets further and further from the (x, y) point\ncorresponding to the mean value of x and the mean value of y, the width of the estimated interval around the\npoint estimate increases. Choosing values of x beyond the range of the data used to estimate the equation\nposes an even greater danger of creating estimates with little use, very large intervals, and risk of error.

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year.

In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.\nLooking at the yearly returns in Table 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL.

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy.

The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\nestimate of what it expects.\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\nby the end of April.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReducing Capital Spending\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. These companies were cutting their capital\nbudgets by 10% to 80% from their originally planned levels for 2020. Reductions were especially large in the\noil and gas industry, as companies found their revenue projections, and thus the NPV of their planned",

Then, subtract the initial investment of year\n0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV—the present values of the cash inflows minus\nthe present value of the cash outflow. Note: Because of the nonstandard use of the term NPV by Excel, many\nusers prefer to use the method described above rather than this predefined function.\nFigure 16.6 NPV Formula ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nCalculating IRR Using Excel\nExcel also provide a function for calculating IRR.

In economics terms, there is an opportunity cost to those who buy a company’s bonds or stock.\nSuppose, for example, that you have $5,000, and you purchase Tesla stock. You could have purchased Apple\nstock or Disney stock instead. There were many other options, but once you chose Tesla stock, you no longer\nhad the money available for the other options. You would only purchase Tesla stock if you thought that you\nwould receive a return as large as you would have for the same level of risk on the other investments.\nFrom Tesla’s perspective, this means that the company can only attract your capital if it offers an expected\nreturn high enough for you to choose it as the company that will use your money. Providing a return equal to\nwhat potential investors could expect to earn elsewhere for a similar risk is the cost a company bears in\nexchange for obtaining funds from investors. Just as a firm must consider the costs of electricity, raw\nmaterials, and wages when it calculates the costs of doing business, it must also consider the cost of attracting\ncapital so that it can purchase its assets.\nWeights in the Capital Structure\nMost companies have multiple sources of capital.

If, for\nexample, a company is financed 25% by debt and 75% by equity, the weights in the WACC would be 25% on the\ndebt cost of capital and 75% on the equity cost of capital.

This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.",

They expect to get $34,320 in one\nyear in return for purchasing this equity. What discount rate does this imply?\n17.4 • Capital Structure Choices\n517\nNotice that the expected return to shareholders has risen from 14% for the unlevered firm to 19.94% for the\nlevered firm. Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.\nWhy does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders.

To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\nequity in the capital structure:\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases.

In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth. Shareholders are willing to allow the company to retain these\nearnings because they expect that the money will be used to fund profitable projects, leading to an even larger\nreward for shareholders in future years.\nAlthough managers do not need to actively solicit the funds that are retained to fund the business, managers\ncannot view these funds as costless.

In other words, you will choose to convert whenever the\nstock price exceeds the conversion price at maturity.\nA convertible bond gives the holder an option; the bondholder is able to choose between the face value cash\nor receiving shares of stock. Options always have a positive value to holders. It is always preferable to be able\nto choose $1,000 or shares of stock than to simply be given $1,000. There is a possibility that the shares of\nstock will be more valuable, and there is no way the choice can put you in a worse position.\nBecause holders of convertible bonds have the valuable option of conversion that holders of nonconvertible\nbonds do not have, convertible debt can be offered with a lower interest rate. It might seem as if the firm\ncould lower its weighted average cost of capital by issuing convertible debt rather than nonconvertible debt.\nHowever, this is not the case. Remember that holders of convertible bonds choose whether they would prefer\nto convert the bond and become a stockholder or receive the face value of the bond at maturity.\nIf a bond has a face value of $1,000, the convertible bond holders will consider whether the stock they can\nconvert to is worth more than $1,000.

Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases. Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt\nequals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.\n17.6 Alternative Sources of Funds\nPreferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over\ncommon stockholders in the order of claimants.

Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential\nchanges they are considering.

Early political economists like Adam Smith and Karl Marx identified\nthis concept of capital, along with labor and entrepreneurship, to be the factors of production.\nThat general idea of capital is important and critical to a company’s productive capacity. This chapter is about\na specific type of capital— working capital—that is just as important as long-term capital. Working capital\ndescribes the resources that are needed to meet the daily, weekly, and monthly operating cash flow needs.\nEmployees are paid out of working capital as well as cash from operations, the fulfillment of merchandise\norders is possible because of working capital, and the liquidity of a company hinges upon how well\nmanagement plans and controls working capital.\nUnderstanding working capital begins with the concept of current assets—those resources of a business that\nare cash, near cash, or expected to be turned into cash within a year through the normal operations of the\nbusiness. Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with\nterm gross working capital.",

Financial managers monitor and analyze each component\nof the cash conversion cycle. Ideally, a company’s management should minimize the number of days it takes\nto convert inventory to cash while maximizing the amount of time it takes to pay suppliers.\nQuickly converting inventory to sales speeds up cash inflows and shortens the cash cycle, but it also could help\nreduce inventory losses as a result of obsolescence. Inventory becomes obsolete because of a variety of\nfactors including time—inventory that has not been sold for a long period of time and is not expected to be\nsold in the future has to be written down or written off according to accounting rules. Write-offs of inventory\ncan result in significant losses for a company. In the food business, inventory conversion periods take on great\nimportance because of spoilage of perishable goods; in retailing, seasonal items lose value the longer they\nstay on the shelves.\nVarious inventory management techniques are used to shorten production time in manufacturing, and in\nretailing, strategies are used to reduce the amount of time a product sits on the shelf or is stored in the\nwarehouse. Production techniques such as just-in-time inventory systems and marketing and pricing\nstrategies can have an impact on the number of days in the inventory conversion cycle.\nFor the receivables collection period, a relatively long receivables collection period means that the company is\nhaving trouble collecting cash from its customers and so whatever can be done to speed up collections while\nstill offering competitive credit terms should be pursued by financial managers. For example, companies that\nconverted paper invoicing to e-invoicing most likely reduce the average collection period by some number of\ndays, as it makes sense that if a bill is transmitted electronically, lag time is cut (no delays because of “snail\nmail”) and collections (payments back to the company from customers) may happen sooner. Other credit\nmanagement techniques, some of which are explained in subsequent sections, can help minimize and control\nthe receivables collection period.\nThe payables deferral period is the one element that probably cannot be optimized without violating credit",

In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a long operating cycle because of the\nproduction process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current\nratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much\nlower current ratios.\nIn recent years, Walmart Stores Inc.

The wait for the cash to flow into the company’s treasury\nfrom the collection of receivables and cash sales can be longer during tough times.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government made paycheck protection program (PPP) loans available\nto help alleviate working capital problems for small and large business when the economy slowed because of\nshutdowns and social distancing. And although 60 percent of the PPP loan proceeds were to go to cover\npayroll-related costs, 40 percent could be used to bolster working capital to meet rent, utilities costs, and some\ninterest expense while companies were “treading water”—waiting for positive cash flow to pick up under a\nrecovery.2\nIt isn’t just during downturns that working capital is strained. Growing companies, even if they are extremely\nprofitable, need additional working capital as they ramp up operations by acquiring raw materials, component\nparts, supplies, or other forms of inventory; hiring temporary or additional employees; and taking on new\nprojects.

A letter of credit is issued by a financial institution on behalf of the foreign buyer\n(importer). The bill of lading is a legal document that gives proof of a contract between a transportation\ncompany and the buyer and is one important piece of documentation that allows the buyer to draw on the\nletter of credit. A bill of lading serves as a document of title and proof of receipt of goods by the shipper.\nThe letter of credit secures a promise of payment to the seller (exporter) provided that the terms of the sale\nare met. For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a\nliability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.\nCost of Trade Credit\nTrade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,\nbank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade\ncredit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts\npayable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long\n576\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nas payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.\nHowever, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of\ncash discounts when offered by sellers.

The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73\npercent.\n19.3\nCash Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why firms hold cash.\n•\nList instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.\nCash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows. To manage\ncash, the cash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected",

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments.

So instead of being reported as accounts receivable—a line item on\nthe Target balance sheet that is separate from cash and cash equivalents—these amounts receivable from\nthird-party financial institutions are considered part of the cash and cash equivalents and are a very liquid asst.\nFor example, the amount of $560,000,000 for January 30, 2021, is considered a cash equivalent since the\nsettlement of these accounts will happen in a day or two with cash deposited in Target’s bank accounts.

The cash will be deposited in the merchant’s bank account in a\nvery short period of time.\nWhen a business makes a sale on account, management (e.g., a credit manager or analyst) does its best to\ndistinguish between customers who have a high likelihood of paying and customers who have a low likelihood.\nCustomers with low credit risk are approved; the decision is based on an effective analysis of creditworthiness.\nCreditworthiness is judged by looking at a number of factors including an evaluation of the customer’s\nfinancial statements, financial ratios, and credit reports (credit scores) based on a customer’s payment history\non credits owed to other firms. If a company has a prior relationship with a customer seeking trade credit, the\ncustomer’s payment history with the firm is also carefully evaluated before additional credit is granted.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCorporate Finance Institute\nCredit managers use various tools and techniques to evaluate creditworthiness of customers. The\nCorporate Finance Institute’s website states that “the ‘5 Cs of Credit’ is a common phrase used to describe\nthe five major factors [character, capacity, collateral, capital, and conditions] used to determine a potential\nborrower’s creditworthiness.” It goes on to say that “a credit report provides a comprehensive account of\nthe borrower’s total debt, current balances, credit limits, and history of defaults and bankruptcies, if any.”5\nMore on the 5 Cs of credit can be found on the Corporate Finance Institute’s website (https://openstax.org/\nr/corporate-finance).\nDetermining the Credit Policy\nA company’s credit policy encompasses rules of credit granting and procedures for the collections of accounts.\nIt’s how a company will process credit applications, utilize credit scoring and credit bureaus, analyze financial\nstatements, make credit limit decisions, and conduct collection efforts when accounts become delinquent (still\noutstanding after their due date).\nEstablishing Credit Terms\nTrade credit terms were discussed earlier. Recall that part of the terms and conditions of a sale are the credit\nterms—elements of a sales agreement (contract) that indicate when payment is due, possible discounts (for\nquick payments), and any late fee charges.\nIf open credit is for a sales transaction, an agreement is made as to the length of time for which credit is to be\ngranted (payment period) and a discount for early payment.

The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due.

Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender). Sometimes a company might request that a slow-paying customer sign a note\npromissory note to further secure the receivable, charge interest, or add some type of collateral to the",

Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk. In 2020, corporations experienced an unprecedented risk\nbecause of COVID-19. Coffee shops were forced to remain closed as communities experienced government-\n3\nStarbucks.

These risks are often classified as\ntransaction, translation, or economic risk.\nTransaction Risk\nTransaction risk is the risk that the value of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result\nof a change in currency exchange rates. If Starbucks agrees to pay a Brazilian coffee grower seven million\nBrazilian reals for an order of one million pounds of coffee beans, Starbucks will need to purchase Brazilian\nreals to pay the bill.

Although Starbucks would have locked in a price of BRL 7,000,000 for one million pounds of coffee\nbeans, it would not have known what the coffee beans would cost the company in terms of US dollars.\nIf the US dollar appreciated so that it cost less to purchase each Brazilian real in July, Starbucks would find that\nit was paying less than $1,287,300 for the coffee beans.

Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the\nexpenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.\nThe Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in\nFigure 20.3. In 2012, $1.00 could be purchased with fewer than 80 Japanese yen. In 2015, it took over 120 yen to\npurchase $1.00.\nFigure 20.3 Japanese Yen to One US Dollar8\nIf a company is receiving yen from customers and paying expenses in dollars, the company is harmed when\nthe yen depreciates relative to the dollar, meaning that the yen the company receives from its customers can\nbe exchanged for fewer dollars. Conversely, when the yen appreciates, it takes fewer yen to purchase each\ndollar; this appreciation of the yen benefits companies with revenues in yen and expenses in dollars.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nProjecting Sales in US Dollars\nThe managers of a firm think that the exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollars will be\nnext year.

Starbucks might purchase a coffee plantation in Costa Rica for 120\nmillion Costa Rican colones. This land is an asset for Starbucks, and as such, the value of it should appear on\nthe company’s balance sheet.\nThe balance sheet for Starbucks is created using US dollar values. Thus, the value of the coffee plantation has\nto be translated to dollars. Because exchange rates are volatile, the dollar value of the asset will vary\ndepending on the day on which the translation takes place. If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,\nthen this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance. The loss is\ndue simply to changes in exchange rates and not the underlying profitability of the company.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers or its\nsales.

A put option gives the owner the\nright, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset.\nCall Options\nIf a Korean company knows that it will need pay a $100,000 bill to a US supplier in six months, it knows how\nmany US dollars it will need to pay the bill. As a Korean company, however, its bank account is denominated in\nKorean won. In six months, it will need to use its Korean won to purchase 100,000 US dollars.\nThe company can determine how many Korean won it would take to purchase $100,000 today. If the current\nexchange rate is\n, then it will need KWN 110,000,000 to pay the bill. The current\nexchange rate is known as the spot rate.\nThe company, however, does not need the US dollars for another six months. The company can purchase a call\noption, which is a contract that will allow it to purchase the needed US dollars in six months at a price stated in\nthe contract. This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate\nthe company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six\nmonths.\nThe price that is in the contract is called the strike price (exercise price).

This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate\nthe company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six\nmonths.\nThe price that is in the contract is called the strike price (exercise price). Suppose the company purchases a\ncall contract for US dollars with a strike price of KWN 1,200/USD. While this contract would be for a set size, or\na certain number of US dollars, we will talk about this transaction as if it were per one US dollar to highlight\nhow options contracts work.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n609\nThe company must pay a price, known as the premium, to purchase this call option contract. For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is\n, then the company will choose to exercise\nthe option. The company will be saving KWN 25 for each dollar purchased, but the company originally paid 50\nKWN for the contract. So, the company will be 25 KWN worse off than if it had never purchased the call option.",

At any spot\nprice higher than KWN 1,250/USD, the firm will be in a better financial position, or will have a positive payoff,\nbecause it purchased the call option. The more the Korean won depreciates over the next six months, the\nhigher the payoff to the firm of owning the call contract. Purchasing the call contract is a way that the\ncompany can protect itself from the currency exposure it faces.\nFor any transaction, there must be two parties—a buyer and a seller. For the company to have purchased the\ncall option, another party must have sold the call option. The seller of a call option is called the option writer.\nLet’s consider the potential benefits and risks to the writer of the call option.\nWhen the company purchases the call option, it pays the premium to the writer. The writer of the option does\nnot have a choice regarding whether the option will be exercised.

If\nthis occurs, the writer of the option collected the KWN 50 option premium when the contract was sold and\nthen never hears from the purchaser again.

The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has\nor its sales\nEuropean option\nan option that the holder can exercise only on the expiration date\nexchange rate\nthe price of one currency in terms of another currency\nexercise price (strike price)\nthe price the option holder pays for the underlying asset when exercising an\noption",
