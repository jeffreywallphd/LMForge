In a general way, differentiate contract law from tort law. \n2. Consider the role of law in supporting ethical norms in our society. \n3. Understand the differing roles of state law and federal law in the US legal system. \n4. Know the difference between criminal cases and civil cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n13 \n \nMost of what we discuss in this book is positive law—US positive law in particular. We will also \nconsider the laws and legal systems of other nations. But first, it will be useful to cover some basic \nconcepts and distinctions. \n \nLaw: The Moral Minimums in a Democratic Society \nThe law does not correct (or claim to correct) every wrong that occurs in society. At a minimum, it aims to \ncurb the worst kind of wrongs, the kinds of wrongs that violate what might be called the “moral \nminimums” that a community demands of its members. These include not only violations of criminal law \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\") but also torts (see Chapter 7 \"Introduction to Tort Law\") and broken \npromises (see Chapter 8 \"Contracts\"). Thus it may be wrong to refuse to return a phone call from a friend, \nbut that wrong will not result in a viable lawsuit against you. But if a phone (or the Internet) is used to \nlibel or slander someone, a tort has been committed, and the law may allow the defamed person to be \ncompensated. \nThere is a strong association between what we generally think of as ethical behavior and what the laws \nrequire and provide. For example, contract law upholds society’s sense that promises—in general—should \nbe kept. Promise-breaking is seen as unethical. The law provides remedies for broken promises (in breach \nof contract cases) but not for all broken promises; some excuses are accepted when it would be reasonable \nto do so. For tort law, harming others is considered unethical. If people are not restrained by law from \nharming one another, orderly society would be undone, leading to anarchy. Tort law provides for \ncompensation when serious injuries or harms occur. As for property law issues, we generally believe that \nprivate ownership of property is socially useful and generally desirable, and it is generally protected (with \nsome exceptions) by laws. You can’t throw a party at my house without my permission, but my right to do \nwhatever I want on my own property may be limited by law; I can’t, without the public’s permission, \noperate an incinerator on my property and burn heavy metals, as toxic ash may be deposited throughout \nthe neighborhood. \n \nThe Common Law: Property, Torts, and Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n14 \nEven before legislatures met to make rules for society, disputes happened and judges decided them. In \nEngland, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision. They often \nresorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way. This is essentially reasoning by analogy. Thus the use of precedent in common-law cases \ncame into being, and a doctrine of stare decisis (pronounced STAR-ay-de-SIGH-sus) became accepted \nin English courts. Stare decisis means, in Latin, “let the decision stand.” \n \nMost judicial decisions that don’t apply legislative acts (known as statutes) will involve one of three areas \nof law—property, contract, or tort. Property law deals with the rights and duties of those who can legally \nown land (real property), how that ownership can be legally confirmed and protected, how property can \nbe bought and sold, what the rights of tenants (renters) are, and what the various kinds of “estates” in \nland are (e.g., fee simple, life estate, future interest, easements, or rights of way). Contract law deals with \nwhat kinds of promises courts should enforce. For example, should courts enforce a contract where one of \nthe parties was intoxicated, underage, or insane? Should courts enforce a contract where one of the \nparties seemed to have an unfair advantage? What kind of contracts would have to be in writing to be \nenforced by courts? Tort law deals with the types of cases that involve some kind of harm and or injury \nbetween the plaintiff and the defendant when no contract exists. Thus if you are libeled or a competitor \nlies about your product, your remedy would be in tort, not contract.",

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts. In the United States, both the states and the federal government have roles to play, and",

When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power.

Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

(This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who",

An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each. The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct",

Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do. \n \nThe importance of an individual’s having these consistent qualities of character is well known. Often we \nremember the last bad thing a person did far more than any or all previous good acts. For example, Eliot \nSpitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good \nthey accomplished as public servants. As for a company, its good reputation also has an incalculable value \nthat when lost takes a great deal of time and work to recover. Shell, Nike, and other companies have \ndiscovered that there is a market for morality, however difficult to measure, and that not paying attention \nto business ethics often comes at a serious price. In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and \ncompliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal proceedings against companies but also \nbecause major companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered retroactively but must be \npursued proactively. For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue \nbecomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the same lesson. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThroughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers \nhave come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social \ncontract theory; and virtue ethics. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nXYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles. Customers \nhave had near-death experiences from sudden acceleration; they would be driving along a highway at normal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n60 \nspeed when suddenly the car would begin to accelerate, and efforts to stop the acceleration by braking fail to \nwork. Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to \ndo so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration. \nInternal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are \nnot being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal. In fact, there appears to be a \npossible flaw in both models, perhaps in a semiconductor chip, that makes sudden acceleration happen. \nInterference by floor mats and poorly designed gas pedals do not seem to be the problem. \nIt is voluntary to report these incidents to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), \nbut the company decides that it will wait awhile and see if there are more complaints. Recalling the two \nmodels so that local dealers and their mechanics could examine them is also an option, but it would be \nextremely costly. Company executives are aware that quarterly and annual profit-and-loss statements, on \nwhich their bonuses depend, could be decisively worse with a recall. They decide that on a cost-benefit basis, \nit makes more sense to wait until there are more accidents and more data. After a hundred or more accidents \nand nearly fifteen fatalities, the company institutes a selective recall, still not notifying NHTSA, which has its \nown experts and the authority to order XYZ to do a full recall of all affected models. \nExperts have advised XYZ that standard failure-analysis methodology requires that the company obtain \nabsolutely every XYZ vehicle that has experienced sudden acceleration, using microscopic analysis of all critical \ncomponents of the electronic system. The company does not wish to take that advice, as it would be—as one \ntop executive put it—“too time-consuming and expensive.” \n1.

Understand one model for ethical decision making: a process to arrive at the most ethical option for an \nindividual or a business organization, using a virtue ethics approach combined with some elements of \nstakeholder analysis and utilitarianism. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Model \nOnce you recognize that there is a decision that involves ethical judgment, Michael Josephson would first \nhave you ask as many questions as are necessary to get a full background on the relevant facts. Then, \nassuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: \n1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions \nthat might be made here? \n2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made. \n3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision. \n4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values. \n5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which \ndecision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders. \n \nIt is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why. In Milton \nFriedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders. In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods \nMarket, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come \nfirst, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 \"Corporations \nand Corporate Governance\"). \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n62 \nThe Core Values \nHere are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nTrustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be \nsincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and \ndon’t betray a trust. Demonstrate integrity—stand up for what you believe, walk the walk as well \nas talking the talk; be what you seem to be; show commitment and courage. Be loyal—stand by \nyour family, friends, co-workers, community, and nation; be discreet with information that \ncomes into your hands; don’t spread rumors or engage in harmful gossip; don’t violate your \nprinciples just to win friendship or approval; don’t ask a friend to do something that is \nwrong. Keep promises—keep your word, honor your commitments, and pay your debts; return \nwhat you borrow. \n \nRespect: Judge people on their merits, not their appearance; be courteous, polite, appreciative, \nand accepting of differences; respect others’ right to make decisions about their own lives; don’t \nabuse, demean, mistreat anyone; don’t use, manipulate, exploit, or take advantage of others. \n \nResponsibility: Be accountable—think about the consequences on yourself and others likely to \nbe affected before you act; be reliable; perform your duties; take responsibility for the \nconsequences of your choices; set a good example and don’t make excuses or take credit for other \npeople’s work. Pursue excellence: Do your best, don’t quit easily, persevere, be diligent, make all \nyou do worthy of pride. Exercise self-restraint—be disciplined, know the difference between what \nyou have a right to do and what is right to do. \n \nFairness: Treat all people fairly, be open-minded; listen; consider opposing viewpoints; be \nconsistent; use only appropriate considerations; don’t let personal feelings improperly interfere \nwith decisions; don’t take unfair advantage of mistakes; don’t take more than your fair share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n63 \nCaring: Show you care about others through kindness, caring, sharing, compassion, and \nempathy; treat others the way you want to be treated; don’t be selfish, mean, cruel, or insensitive \nto others’ feelings. \n \nCitizenship: Play by the rules, obey laws; do your share, respect authority, stay informed, vote, \nprotect your neighbors, pay your taxes; be charitable, help your community; protect the \nenvironment, conserve resources. \n \n \nWhen individuals and organizations confront ethical problems, the core values decision model offered by \nJosephson generally works well (1) to clarify the gains and losses of the various stakeholders, which then",

The defendant did something in that state, related to the lawsuit, that makes it fair \nfor the state to say, “Come back and defend!” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n104 \n4. Service of process within the state will effectively provide personal jurisdiction over the \nnonresident. \n \nAgain, let’s consider Mrs. Robinson and her children in the Audi accident. She could file a lawsuit \nanywhere in the country. She could file a lawsuit in Arizona after she establishes residency there. But \nwhile the Arizona court would have subject matter jurisdiction over any products-liability claim (or any \nclaim that was not required to be heard in a federal court), the Arizona court would face an issue of “in \npersonam jurisdiction,” or personal jurisdiction: under the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, each state must extend due process to citizens of all of the other states. Because fairness is \nessential to due process, the court must consider whether it is fair to require an out-of-state defendant to \nappear and defend against a lawsuit that could result in a judgment against that defendant. \nAlmost every state in the United States has a statute regarding personal jurisdiction, instructing judges \nwhen it is permissible to assert personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state resident. These are called long-\narm statutes. But no state can reach out beyond the limits of what is constitutionally permissible under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, which binds the states with its proviso to guarantee the due process rights of \nthe citizens of every state in the union. The “minimum contacts” test in Burger King v. \nRudzewicz (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") tries to make the fairness mandate of the due process clause more \nspecific. So do other tests articulated in the case (such as “does not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice”). These tests are posed by the Supreme Court and heeded by all lower courts in \norder to honor the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process guarantees. These tests are in \naddition to any state long-arm statute’s instructions to courts regarding the assertion of personal \njurisdiction over nonresidents. \n \nChoice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses \nIn a series of cases, the Supreme Court has made clear that it will honor contractual choices of parties in a \nlawsuit. Suppose the parties to a contract wind up in court arguing over the application of the contract’s \nterms. If the parties are from two different states, the judge may have difficulty determining which law to \napply (see Table 3.1 \"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). But if the contract says that a particular state’s \nlaw will be applied if there is a dispute, then ordinarily the judge will apply that state’s law as a rule of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n105 \ndecision in the case. For example, Kumar Patel (a Missouri resident) opens a brokerage account with \nGoldman, Sachs and Co., and the contractual agreement calls for “any disputes arising under this \nagreement” to be determined “according to the laws of the state of New York.” When Kumar claims in a \nMissouri court that his broker is “churning” his account, and, on the other hand, Goldman, Sachs claims \nthat Kumar has failed to meet his margin call and owes $38,568.25 (plus interest and attorney’s fees), the \njudge in Missouri will apply New York law based on the contract between Kumar and Goldman, Sachs. \n \nOrdinarily, a choice-of-law clause will be accompanied by a choice-of-forum clause. In a choice-of-forum \nclause, the parties in the contract specify which court they will go to in the event of a dispute arising under \nthe terms of contract. For example, Harold (a resident of Virginia) rents a car from Alamo at the Denver \nInternational Airport. He does not look at the fine print on the contract. He also waives all collision and \nother insurance that Alamo offers at the time of his rental. While driving back from Telluride Bluegrass \nFestival, he has an accident in Idaho Springs, Colorado. His rented Nissan Altima is badly damaged. On \nreturning to Virginia, he would like to settle up with Alamo, but his insurance company and Alamo cannot \ncome to terms. He realizes, however, that he has agreed to hear the dispute with Alamo in a specific court \nin San Antonio, Texas. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, any court in the United States is likely to \nuphold the choice-of-form clause and require Harold (or his insurance company) to litigate in San \nAntonio, Texas. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are two court systems in the United States. It is important to know which system—the state court \nsystem or the federal court system—has the power to hear and decide a particular case. Once that is",

For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years. Depositions can consume days or even weeks of an executive’s time. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nMany cases never get to trial. They are disposed of by motions to dismiss or are settled after extensive \ndiscovery makes clear to the parties the strengths and weaknesses of the parties to the dispute. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n110 \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

If the case is \nbrought in a state where contributory negligence is the law, on what basis can Johnson & Johnson have the \ncase dismissed before trial? \n \n \n \n \n3.4 The Pretrial and Trial Phase \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

Unless it is \nvery clear, the judge will deny a summary judgment motion, because that ends the case at the trial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n111 \nlevel; it is a “final order” in the case that tells the plaintiff “no” and leaves no room to bring another \nlawsuit against the defendant for that particular set of facts (res judicata). If the plaintiff successfully \nappeals a summary judgment motion, the case will come back to the trial court. \n \nPrior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in an effort to investigate the possibilities of \nsettlement. Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the \nattorneys. The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial. \nFor the most part, courts of appeal will not reverse and remand for a new trial unless the trial court \njudge’s errors are “prejudicial,” or “an abuse of discretion.” In short, neither party is entitled to a perfect \ntrial, but only to a fair trial, one in which the trial judge has made only “harmless errors” and not \nprejudicial ones. \n \nAt the end of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant presents his case, following the same procedure just \noutlined. The plaintiff is then entitled to present rebuttal witnesses, if necessary, to deny or argue with the \nevidence the defendant has introduced. The defendant in turn may present “surrebuttal” witnesses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n114 \n \nWhen all testimony has been introduced, either party may ask the judge for a directed verdict—a \nverdict decided by the judge without advice from the jury. This motion may be granted if the plaintiff has \nfailed to introduce evidence that is legally sufficient to meet her burden of proof or if the defendant has \nfailed to do the same on issues on which she has the burden of proof. (For example, the plaintiff alleges \nthat the defendant owes him money and introduces a signed promissory note. The defendant cannot show \nthat the note is invalid. The defendant must lose the case unless he can show that the debt has been paid \nor otherwise discharged.) \n \nThe defendant can move for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff’s case, but the judge will usually \nwait to hear the entire case until deciding whether to do so. Directed verdicts are not usually granted, \nsince it is the jury’s job to determine the facts in dispute. \n \nIf the judge refuses to grant a directed verdict, each lawyer will then present a closing argument to the \njury (or, if there is no jury, to the judge alone). The closing argument is used to tie up the loose ends, as \nthe attorney tries to bring together various seemingly unrelated facts into a story that will make sense to \nthe jury. \n \nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury. The purpose of jury instruction is to explain to \nthe jurors the meaning of the law as it relates to the issues they are considering and to tell the jurors what \nfacts they must determine if they are to give a verdict for one party or the other. Each lawyer will have \nprepared a set of written instructions that she hopes the judge will give to the jury. These will be tailored \nto advance her client’s case. Many a verdict has been overturned on appeal because a trial judge has \nwrongly instructed the jury. The judge will carefully determine which instructions to give and often will \nuse a set of pattern instructions provided by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state. \nThese pattern jury instructions are often safer because they are patterned after language that appellate \ncourts have used previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible error in the instructions. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n115 \nAfter all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a private room and discuss the case and the answers \nrequested by the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict. Some minor cases do not \nrequire a unanimous verdict. If the jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the case \nwill have to be retried. When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their \nlawyers present. The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge. (If there is no \njury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to \nthose facts. Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is.

By statute, Congress and the state legislatures \nhave provided that the winning party in particular classes of cases may recover its full legal costs from the \nloser—for example, the federal antitrust laws so provide and so does the federal Equal Access to Justice \nAct. The other exception applies to litigants who either initiate lawsuits in bad faith, with no expectation \nof winning, or who defend them in bad faith, in order to cause the plaintiff great expense. Under these \ncircumstances, a court has the discretion to award attorneys’ fees to the winner. But this rule is not \ninfinitely flexible, and courts do not have complete freedom to award attorneys’ fees in any amount, but \nonly \"reasonable\" attorney's fees. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n126 \nLitigation is expensive. Getting a lawyer can be costly, unless you get a lawyer on a contingent fee. Not all legal \nsystems allow contingent fees. In many legal systems, the loser pays attorneys’ fees for both parties. \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Mrs. Robinson’s attorney estimates that they will recover a million dollars from Volkswagen in the Audi \nlawsuit. She has Mrs. Robinson sign a contract that gives her firm one-third of any recovery after the firm’s \nexpenses are deducted. The judge does in fact award a million dollars, and the defendant pays.

In dismissing the case, however, who (under English law) will bear the costs of the \nattorneys who have brought the case for Potter and defended the matter for Malfoy? \n \n \n \n \n3.8 Alternative Means of Resolving Disputes \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how arbitration and mediation are frequently used alternatives to litigation. \n2. Describe the differences between arbitration and mediation. \n3. Explain why arbitration is final and binding. \n \n \nDisputes do not have to be settled in court. No law requires parties who have a legal dispute to seek \njudicial resolution if they can resolve their disagreement privately or through some other public \nforum. In fact, the threat of a lawsuit can frequently motivate parties toward private negotiation. \nFiling a lawsuit may convince one party that the other party is serious. Or the parties may decide that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n127 \nthey will come to terms privately rather than wait the three or four years it can frequently take for a \ncase to move up on the court calendar. \n \nArbitration \nBeginning around 1980, a movement toward alternative dispute resolution began to gain force throughout \nthe United States. Bar associations, other private groups, and the courts themselves wanted to find \nquicker and cheaper ways for litigants and potential litigants to settle certain types of quarrels than \nthrough the courts. As a result, neighborhood justice centers or dispute resolution centers have sprung up \nin communities. These are where people can come for help in settling disputes, of both civil and criminal \nnature, that should not consume the time and money of the parties or courts in lengthy proceedings. \n \nThese alternative forums use a variety of methods, including arbitration, mediation, and conciliation, to \nbring about agreement or at least closure of the dispute. These methods are not all alike, and their \ndifferences are worth noting. \n \nArbitration is a type of adjudication. The parties use a private decision maker, the arbitrator, and the \nrules of procedure are considerably more relaxed than those that apply in the courtroom. Arbitrators \nmight be retired judges, lawyers, or anyone with the kind of specialized knowledge and training that \nwould be useful in making a final, binding decision on the dispute. In a contractual relationship, the \nparties can decide even before a dispute arises to use arbitration when the time comes. Or parties can \ndecide after a dispute arises to use arbitration instead of litigation. In a predispute arbitration agreement \n(often part of a larger contract), the parties can spell out the rules of procedure to be used and the method \nfor choosing the arbitrator. For example, they may name the specific person or delegate the responsibility \nof choosing to some neutral person, or they may each designate a person and the two designees may \njointly pick a third arbitrator. \n \nMany arbitrations take place under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, a private \norganization headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many other cities. The association uses \npublished sets of rules for various types of arbitration (e.g., labor arbitration or commercial arbitration);",

Similarly, a publisher who distributes magazines in a \ndistant State may fairly be held accountable in that forum for damages resulting there from an allegedly \ndefamatory story.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n132 \n…[T]he constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant purposefully established “minimum \ncontacts” in the forum State.…In defining when it is that a potential defendant should “reasonably \nanticipate” out-of-state litigation, the Court frequently has drawn from the reasoning of Hanson v. \nDenckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958): \n \nThe unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot \nsatisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State. The application of that rule will vary \nwith the quality and nature of the defendant’s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be \nsome act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities \nwithin the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. \n \nThis “purposeful availment” requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction \nsolely as a result of “random,” “fortuitous,” or “attenuated” contacts, or of the “unilateral activity of \nanother party or a third person,” [Citations] Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts \nproximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a “substantial connection” with the \nforum State. [Citations] Thus where the defendant “deliberately” has engaged in significant activities \nwithin a State, or has created “continuing obligations” between himself and residents of the forum, he \nmanifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are \nshielded by “the benefits and protections” of the forum’s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to \nrequire him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well. \n \nJurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically \nenter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s \naffiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of \nmodern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire \ncommunications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which \nbusiness is conducted. So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are “purposefully directed” toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat \npersonal jurisdiction there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n133 \n \nOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum \nState, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of \npersonal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S., at 320. Thus courts in “appropriate case[s]” may evaluate “the burden on the \ndefendant,” “the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining \nconvenient and effective relief,” “the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient \nresolution of controversies,” and the “shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental \nsubstantive social policies.” These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of \njurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required.

[1] [Citations omitted] In the absence of evidence that a warning \nwould have prevented the harm complained of by altering the plaintiff’s conduct, the failure to warn \ncannot be deemed a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury as a matter of law.

The US Supreme Court is \nthe ultimate arbiter of those disputes, and as such it has a unique role in the legal system. It has \nassumed the power of judicial review, unique among federal systems globally, through which it can \nstrike down federal or state statutes that it believes violate the Constitution and can even void the \npresident’s executive orders if they are contrary to the Constitution’s language. No knowledgeable \ncitizen or businessperson can afford to be ignorant of its basic provisions. \n \n \n4.1 Basic Aspects of the US Constitution \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Describe the American values that are reflected in the US Constitution. \n2. Know what federalism means, along with separation of powers. \n3. Explain the process of amending the Constitution and why judicial review is particularly significant. \n \n \nThe Constitution as Reflecting American Values \nIn the US, the one document to which all public officials and military personnel pledge their unswerving \nallegiance is the Constitution. If you serve, you are asked to “support and defend” the Constitution \n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The oath usually includes a statement that you swear that this \noath is taken freely, honestly, and without “any purpose of evasion.” This loyalty oath may be related to a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n141 \ntime—fifty years ago—when “un-American” activities were under investigation in Congress and the press; \nthe fear of communism (as antithetical to American values and principles) was paramount. As you look at \nthe Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it \nmay impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign \nand domestic.” \n \nIn Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives \nare elected to public office. Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and \nsmall states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states \nhave two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the \npresidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. \nArticle II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the \nelection process. Article III creates the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, makes \nclear that individual rights must be preserved against activities of the federal government. In general, the \nidea of rights is particularly strong. \n \nThe Constitution itself speaks of rights in fairly general terms, and the judicial interpretation of various \nrights has been in flux. The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI).

Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” \nThe general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in \naccord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their \nown views and values. Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the \nConstitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics \nof the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as \nthe right of states to be free from federal antidiscrimination laws. See, for example, Kimel v. Florida \nBoard of Regents, or the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case (Section 4.6.5), which held \nthat corporations are “persons” with “free speech rights” that include spending unlimited amounts of \nmoney in campaign donations and political advocacy. [3] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n144 \nBecause Roe v. Wade has been so controversial, this chapter includes a seminal case on “the right of \nprivacy,” Griswold v. Connecticut, Section 4.6.1. Was the court was correct in recognizing a “right of \nprivacy” in Griswold? This may not seem like a “business case,” but consider: the manufacture and \ndistribution of birth control devices is a highly profitable (and legal) business in every US state. Moreover, \nGriswold illustrates another important and much-debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive \ndue process (see Section 4.5.3 \"Fifth Amendment\"). The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is \nbrought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business \nafter Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited \nrather than overruled Roe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, \nand efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In \ndeciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the \nSupreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the \nConstitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its \ninterpretation. Only a constitutional amendment or the court’s repudiation of Roe v. Wade as a precedent \ncould change that interpretation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n145 \nThe Constitution gives voice to the idea that people have basic rights and that a civilian president is also the \ncommander in chief of the armed forces.

The commerce clause gives Congress the exclusive power to make \nlaws relating to foreign trade and commerce and to commerce among the various states. Most of the \nfederally created legal environment springs from this one clause: if Congress is not authorized in the \nConstitution to make certain laws, then it acts unconstitutionally and its actions may be ruled \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Lately, the Supreme Court has not been shy about ruling acts of \nCongress unconstitutional. \n \nHere are the first five parts of Article I, Section 8, which sets forth the powers of the federal legislature. \nThe commerce clause is in boldface. It is short, but most federal legislation affecting business depends on \nthis very clause: \n \nSection 8 \n[Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; \nbut all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; \n[Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \n \n[Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes; \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n147 \n[Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of \nBankruptcies throughout the United States; \n \n[Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of \nWeights and Measures; \n \nEarly Commerce Clause Cases \nFor many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying the commerce clause: Congress could only \nuse it to legislate aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another. Anything else was deemed \nlocal rather than national. For example, In Hammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916 federal statute \nhad barred transportation in interstate commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing \nchildren under fourteen or employing children fourteen and above for more than eight hours a day. A \ncomplaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his \nown behalf and on behalf of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other \nbetween fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nThe father’s lawsuit asked the court to enjoin (block) the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to \nprevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor. \n \nThe Supreme Court saw the issue as whether Congress had the power under the commerce clause to \ncontrol interstate shipment of goods made by children under the age of fourteen. The court found that \nCongress did not. The court cited several cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be \nconstitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of",

But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was \nlacking. The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the \nlabor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact \nthat they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to \nfederal control under the commerce power.” \n \nIn short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between \nstates. Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it \na fit subject for national regulation. The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a \nmatter of local regulation. The court therefore upheld the result from the district and circuit court of \nappeals; the application of the federal law was enjoined. Goods produced by children under the age of \nfourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United States without violating the federal law. \n \nFrom the New Deal to the New Frontier and the Great  \nSociety: 1930s–1970 \nDuring the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and \nPresident Roosevelt’s New Deal program required more active federal legislation. Included in the New \nDeal program was the recognition of a “right” to form labor unions without undue interference from \nemployers. Congress created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to \nenjoin employer practices that violated this right. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n149 \nIn NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union dispute with management at a large steel-\nproducing facility near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case. In this case, the NLRB had charged \nthe Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation with discriminating against employees who were union members. \nThe company’s position was that the law authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding \nCongress’s powers. The court held that the act was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial \nactivities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce. The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was",

Why would Congress have power under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require restaurants and hotels to not \ndiscriminate against interstate travelers on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin? Suppose \nthe Holiday Restaurant near I-80 in Des Moines, Iowa, has a sign that says, “We reserve the right to refuse \nservice to any Muslim or person of Middle Eastern descent.” Suppose also that the restaurant is very \npopular locally and that only 40 percent of its patrons are travelers on I-80. Are the owners of the Holiday \nRestaurant in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?

McClung, 379 US 294 (1964). \n \n \n \n4.3 Dormant Commerce Clause \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand that when Congress does not exercise its powers under the commerce clause, the Supreme \nCourt may still limit state legislation that discriminates against interstate commerce or places an undue \nburden on interstate commerce. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n154 \n2. Distinguish between “discrimination” dormant-commerce-clause cases and “undue burden” dormant-\ncommerce-clause cases. \n \n \nCongress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause and often does legislate. For example, \nCongress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in \nlength. But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and \nlength of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules. States may do so under the so-\ncalled historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government. \nThese police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, \nmorals, and the environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when \nstate action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate. This power is \nclaimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause. \n \nThere are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an \n“undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be \nstruck down. Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 \"Summary and Exercises\", is an example \nof a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on \nits highways. [1] Iowa’s prohibition was judicially declared void when the Supreme Court judged it to be an \nundue burden. \n \nDiscrimination cases such as Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\") \npose a different standard. The court has been fairly inflexible here: if one state discriminates in its \ntreatment of any article of commerce based on its state of origin, the court will strike down the law. For \nexample, in Oregon Waste Systems v. Department of Environmental Quality, the state wanted to place a \nslightly higher charge on waste coming from out of state. [2] The state’s reasoning was that in-state \nresidents had already contributed to roads and other infrastructure and that tipping fees at waste facilities \nshould reflect the prior contributions of in-state companies and residents. Out-of-state waste handlers \nwho wanted to use Oregon landfills objected and won their dormant commerce clause claim that Oregon’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n155 \nlaw discriminated “on its face” against interstate commerce. Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything \nthat moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of \nsomething instead of buying something. \n \nThus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing \nthat differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that \noriginate elsewhere.

Liggett Group (1993) was a closely watched case concerning the extent of an express \npreemption provision in two cigarette labeling laws of the 1960s. The case was a wrongful death action \nbrought against tobacco companies on behalf of Rose Cipollone, a lung cancer victim who had started \nsmoking cigarette in the 1940s. The court considered the preemptive effect on state law of a provision that \nstated, “No requirement based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to \nthe advertising and promotion of cigarettes.” The court concluded that several types of state tort actions \nwere preempted by the provision but allowed other types to go forward. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn cases of conflicts between state and federal law, federal law will preempt (or control) state law because of \nthe supremacy clause. Preemption can be express or implied. In cases where preemption is implied, the court \nusually finds that compliance with both state and federal law is not possible or that a federal regulatory \nscheme is comprehensive (i.e., “occupies the field”) and should not be modified by state actions. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

At the same time, concern over oil \nspills in Puget Sound led the state of Washington to impose fairly strict standards on oil tankers and \nrequirements for the training of oil tanker pilots. In addition, Washington’s state law imposed many other \nrequirements that went above and beyond agreed-upon requirements in the international agreements \nnegotiated by the federal government.

The legislation does preserve the right of \nconsumers to litigate in the event of a dispute arising with the product or service provider; that is, with this \nlegislation, consumers will not unknowingly waive their right to a trial at common law.

The states cannot constitutionally award a judgment against a \nnonresident if doing so would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Even if the \nstate’s long-arm statute would seem to allow such a judgment, other states should not give it full faith and \ncredit (see Article V of the Constitution). In short, a state’s long-arm statute cannot confer personal \njurisdiction that the state cannot constitutionally claim. \n \nThe Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) was originally meant to apply to federal \nactions only. During the twentieth century, the court began to apply selected rights to state action as well. \nSo, for example, federal agents were prohibited from using evidence seized in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment, but state agents were not, until Mapp v.

It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public \nofficials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the \nprotection of the First Amendment. \n \nPolitical speech is so highly protected that the court has recognized the right of people to support political \ncandidates through campaign contributions and thus promote the particular viewpoints and speech of \nthose candidates. Fearing the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to time placed \nlimitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns. But the Supreme Court has had mixed \nreactions over time. Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment right of a corporation to donate \nmoney, subject to certain limits. [2] In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), the \nMichigan Campaign Finance Act prohibited corporations from using treasury money for independent \nexpenditures to support or oppose candidates in elections for state offices. But a corporation could make \nsuch expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely for political purposes. The law was \npassed on the assumption that “the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitate \nsome regulation of their political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.” \n \nThe Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support a candidate for Michigan’s House of \nRepresentatives by using general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and argued that as a \nnonprofit organization, it was not really like a business firm. The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan \nlaw. Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a business group, given its activities, linkages \nwith community business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75 percent) that were business \ncorporations. Furthermore, Justice Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and \nimplemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining integrity in the political process. But as you \nwill see in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\"), Austin was overruled; \ncorporations are recognized as “persons” with First Amendment political speech rights that cannot be \nimpaired by Congress or the states without some compelling governmental interest with restrictions on \nthose rights that are “narrowly tailored.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n166 \n \nFourth Amendment \nThe Fourth Amendment says, “all persons shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a \nmagistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons to be searched and places to be seized.” \n \nThe court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that \nare “unreasonable.” Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is “closely regulated” can be \nsearched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a \njunkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search \nthat found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, \nbecause the dealer was in a “closely regulated industry.” \n \nIn the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nThe EPA had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow plant, using an aerial mapping \ncamera to photograph various pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof. Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional. Because the literal language of the Fourth Amendment protected “persons, houses, papers, \nand effects,” anything searched by the government in “open fields” was reasonable. (The court’s opinion \nsuggested that if Dow had really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could have covered the \npipes and machinery that were otherwise outside and in open fields.) \n \nNote again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your \nemployer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits.

In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents \ngovernment from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also \nconstitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair. This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger \nKing v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, \nbut the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely \ncontract with one another. Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down \nthat aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions. \nHowever, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of \nlaws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties. The first category",

            "chunk": "laws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties. The first category \nincludes most of the liberties expressly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Through a process known as \nselective incorporation, the court has interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nbar states from denying their residents the most important freedoms guaranteed in the first ten \namendments to the federal Constitution. Only the Third Amendment right (against involuntary \nquartering of soldiers) and the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury have not been made \napplicable to the states. Because these rights are still not applicable to state governments, the Supreme \nCourt is often said to have “selectively incorporated” the Bill of Rights into the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n169 \nThe second category of fundamental liberties includes those liberties that are not expressly stated in the \nBill of Rights but that can be seen as essential to the concepts of freedom and equality in a democratic \nsociety. These unstated liberties come from Supreme Court precedents, common law, moral philosophy, \nand deeply rooted traditions of US legal history. The Supreme Court has stressed that he \nword liberty cannot be defined by a definitive list of rights; rather, it must be viewed as a rational \ncontinuum of freedom through which every aspect of human behavior is protected from arbitrary \nimpositions and random restraints. In this regard, as the Supreme Court has observed, the due process \nclause protects abstract liberty interests, including the right to personal autonomy, bodily integrity, self-\ndignity, and self-determination. \n \nThese liberty interests often are grouped to form a general right to privacy, which was first recognized \nin Griswold v. Connecticut (Section 4.6.1), where the Supreme Court struck down a state statute \nforbidding married adults from using, possessing, or distributing contraceptives on the ground that the \nlaw violated the sanctity of the marital relationship. According to Justice Douglas’s plurality opinion, this \npenumbra of privacy, though not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, must be protected to establish \na buffer zone or breathing space for those freedoms that are constitutionally enumerated. \n \nBut substantive due process has seen fairly limited use since the 1930s. During the 1990s, the Supreme \nCourt was asked to recognize a general right to die under the doctrine of substantive due process. \nAlthough the court stopped short of establishing such a far-reaching right, certain patients may exercise a \nconstitutional liberty to hasten their deaths under a narrow set of circumstances. In Cruzan v. Missouri \nDepartment of Health, the Supreme Court ruled that the due process clause guarantees the right of \ncompetent adults to make advanced directives for the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures should they \nbecome incapacitated by a disability that leaves them in a persistent vegetative state. [4] Once it has been \nestablished by clear and convincing evidence that a mentally incompetent and persistently vegetative \npatient made such a prior directive, a spouse, parent, or other appropriate guardian may seek to terminate \nany form of artificial hydration or nutrition. \n \nFourteenth Amendment: Due Process and Equal Protection Guarantees \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n170 \nThe Fourteenth Amendment (1868) requires that states treat citizens of other states with due process. \nThis can be either an issue of procedural due process (as in Section 3.9 \"Cases\", Burger King v. \nRudzewicz) or an issue of substantive due process. For substantive due process, consider what happened \nin an Alabama court not too long ago. [5] \nThe plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW for $40,000 from a dealer in Alabama. He later discovered \nthat the vehicle’s exterior had been slightly damaged in transit from Europe and had therefore been \nrepainted by the North American distributor prior to his purchase. The vehicle was, by best estimates, \nworth about 10 percent less than he paid for it. The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely \nsold slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of \nthe car. In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages. The",

The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely \nsold slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of \nthe car. In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages. The \nAlabama trial jury considered that BMW was engaging in a fraudulent practice and wanted to punish the \ndefendant for a number of frauds it estimated at somewhere around a thousand nationwide. The jury \nawarded not only the $4,000 in compensatory damages but also $4 million in punitive damages, which \nwas later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. On appeal to the US Supreme Court, the \ncourt found that punitive damages may not be “grossly excessive.” If they are, then they violate \nsubstantive due process. Whatever damages a state awards must be limited to what is reasonably \nnecessary to vindicate the state’s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. \n \n“Equal protection of the laws” is a phrase that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868. \nThe amendment provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.” This is the equal protection clause. It means that, generally speaking, \ngovernments must treat people equally. Unfair classifications among people or corporations will not be \npermitted. A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white \nchildren and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public \nservices, such as water fountains or restrooms. Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954). [6] \n \nGovernments make classifications every day, so not all classifications can be illegal under the equal \nprotection clause. People with more income generally pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n171 \nPeople with proper medical training are licensed to become doctors; people without that training cannot \nbe licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do practice medicine. To know what classifications are \npermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified. The court has \ncreated three classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by \nknowing how the court is likely to classify the case: \n \n• \nMinimal scrutiny: economic and social relations. Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights. Classifications based on any of these are \nalmost never upheld. \n \nUnder minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues \nare presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen. For example, suppose that the city council decreed that all street vendors must be women, thinking \nthat would attract even more tourism. A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner \ntest than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to \nsubstantially relate to important government objectives. Increasingly, courts have nullified government \nsex classifications as societal concern with gender equality has grown. (See Shannon Faulkner’s case \nagainst The Citadel, an all-male state school.) [7] \n \nSuppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could \ndrive a taxicab or be a street vendor. That kind of classification would be examined with strict scrutiny to \nsee if there was any compelling justification for it. As noted, classifications such as this one are almost \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n172 \nnever upheld. The law would be upheld only if it were necessary to promote a compelling state interest. \nVery few laws that have a racial or ethnic classification meet that test. \n \nThe strict scrutiny test will be applied to classifications involving racial and ethnic criteria as well as",

It has been \nhis practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; \nto sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use \nsome in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. \n \nHis 1941 wheat acreage allotment was 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He \nsowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under \nthe terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty \nof 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. \n \nThe general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the \nvolume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the \nconsequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce. [T]he Secretary of \nAgriculture is directed to ascertain and proclaim each year a national acreage allotment for the next crop \nof wheat, which is then apportioned to the states and their counties, and is eventually broken up into \nallotments for individual farms. \nIt is urged that under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Article I, § 8, clause 3, Congress does not \npossess the power it has in this instance sought to exercise. The question would merit little consideration \nsince our decision in United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, sustaining the federal power to regulate \nproduction of goods for commerce, except for the fact that this Act extends federal regulation to \nproduction not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm. \n \nKassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. \nKassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. \n450 U.S. 662 (U.S. Supreme Court 1981) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n179 \n \nJUSTICE POWELL announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE \nWHITE, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS joined. \n \nThe question is whether an Iowa statute that prohibits the use of certain large trucks within the State \nunconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \n \nI \nAppellee Consolidated Freightways Corporation of Delaware (Consolidated) is one of the largest common \ncarriers in the country: it offers service in 48 States under a certificate of public convenience and necessity \nissued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities \nthrough Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west \ncoast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route. \n \nConsolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks. One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40-foot two-\naxle trailer. This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall. Such trucks have \nlong been used on the Nation’s highways. Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle \ntrailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single-axle trailer. This combination, known \nas a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall. Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, \nincreasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities. Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways. Unlike all \nother States in the West and Midwest, Iowa generally prohibits the use of 65-foot doubles within its \nborders. \n \n… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n180 \nBecause of Iowa’s statutory scheme, Consolidated cannot use its 65-foot doubles to move commodities \nthrough the State. Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce",

On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests. \nThe total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight and \nproblematical that it does not outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from \ninterferences that seriously impede it.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n181 \nThe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 612 F.2d 1064 (1979). It accepted the District Court’s \nfinding that 65-foot doubles were as safe as 55-foot singles. Id. at 1069. Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. Id. at 1070-1071. The combination of these exemptions \nweakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation. For these reasons, the \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened \ninterstate commerce. \n \nIowa appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 446 U.S. 950 (1980). We now affirm. \n \n \n \nII \nIt is unnecessary to review in detail the evolution of the principles of Commerce Clause adjudication. The \nClause is both a “prolific ‘ of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the \nstate[s].” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 336 U.S. 534 (1949). The Clause permits \nCongress to legislate when it perceives that the national welfare is not furthered by the independent \nactions of the States. It is now well established, also, that the Clause itself is “a limitation upon state power \neven without congressional implementation.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333 at 350 (1977). The Clause requires that some aspects of trade generally must remain free from \ninterference by the States. When a State ventures excessively into the regulation of these aspects of \ncommerce, it “trespasses upon national interests,” Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce. It has long been \nrecognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n182 \nstate to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect \ninterstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 \n(1945). \n \nThe extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure. It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local",

It noted that “the \nSupreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though \nthe speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.” Id. at 281. \n \nII \n[Omitted: the court considers whether it is possible to reject the BCRA without declaring certain \nprovisions unconstitutional. The court concludes it cannot find a basis to reject the BCRA that does not \ninvolve constitutional issues.] \n \n \nIII \nThe First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech.” \nLaws enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at different points in the speech process.…The \nlaw before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all \ncorporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or \ndefeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election \nand 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n194 \nClub runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to \ndisapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association \npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports \na handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a \nPresidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic \nexamples of censorship. \n \nSection 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation \ncan still speak. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to \nextensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the \ntreasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve \nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within \n10 days. \n \nAnd that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at \ndifferent times depending on the type of election that is about to occur.… \n \nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the \nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs. PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. \nGiven the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views \nknown regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign. \nSection 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \n“restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a \ncampaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues \ndiscussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1 at 19 (1976).… \n \nSpeech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the \npeople. See Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n195 \ncitizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.”) The right of citizens to \ninquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-\ngovernment and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent \napplication’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” \n \nFor these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or \ninadvertence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the \nGovernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” \n \n… \n \nThe Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784. The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of \ncorporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply \nbecause such associations are not “natural persons.” \n \nThe purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations,",

Two years later, the South Carolina legislature passed a statute \nthat prohibited building beachfront properties. The purpose was to leave the dunes system in place to \nmitigate the effects of hurricanes and strong storms. The South Carolina Coastal Commission created the \nrules and regulations with substantial input from the community and from experts and with protection of \nthe dune system primarily in mind. People had been building on the shoreline for years, with harmful \nresults to localities and the state treasury. When Lucas applied for permits to build two houses near the \nshoreline, his permits were rejected. He sued, arguing that the South Carolina legislation had effectively \n“taken” his property. At trial, South Carolina conceded that because of the legislation, Lucas’s property was \neffectively worth zero. Has there been a taking under the Fifth Amendment (as incorporated through the \nFourteenth Amendment), and if so, what should the state owe to Lucas? Suppose that Lucas could have \nmade an additional $1 million by building a house on each of his parcels.

The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, \nhowever, an example of destructive noncompetition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n208 \n \nOther market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation. For example, there is a need to regulate \nfrequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, \nnational defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something \nthat must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods \nsuch as education, a highway system, lighthouses, a military for defense. \n \nTrue laissez-faire capitalism—a market free from any regulation—would not try to deal with market \nimperfections and would also allow people to freely choose products, services, and other arrangements \nthat historically have been deemed socially unacceptable. These would include making enforceable \ncontracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or \ncrack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage \npartnership. \n \nThus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by \nwhat is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the \nsocial arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or \nunsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers \nfrom unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can \nbe used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment \ndiscrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and \nmonitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental \nProtection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company). \n \nHistory of Federal Agencies \nThrough the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between \nthe states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers \nto an agency. In later decisions, it was made clear that Congress could delegate some of its legislative \npowers, but only if the delegation of authority was not overly broad. \n \nStill, some congressional enabling acts are very broad, such as the enabling legislation for the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is given the authority to make rules to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n212 \nprovide for safe and healthful working conditions in US workplaces.

In these acts, Congress must delegate \nauthority by giving the agency some direction as to what it wants the agency to do.

Understand how Congress controls administrative agencies. \n3. Understand how the courts can control administrative agencies. \n \n \nDuring the course of the past seventy years, a substantial debate has been conducted, often in shrill \nterms, about the legitimacy of administrative lawmaking. One criticism is that agencies are \n“captured” by the industry they are directed to regulate. Another is that they overregulate, stifling \nindividual initiative and the ability to compete. During the 1960s and 1970s, a massive outpouring of \nfederal law created many new agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones. In the \nlate 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress began to deregulate American society, and \nderegulation increased under the Reagan administration. But the accounting frauds of WorldCom, \nEnron, and others led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown of 2008 has \nled to reregulation of the financial sector. It remains to be seen whether the Deepwater Horizon oil \nblowout of 2010 will lead to more environmental regulations or a rethinking on how to make \nagencies more effective regulators. \n \nAdministrative agencies are the focal point of controversy because they are policy-making bodies, \nincorporating facets of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form that fits uneasily at \nbest in the framework of American government (see Figure 5.1 \"Major Administrative Agencies of the \nUnited States\"). They are necessarily at the center of tugging and hauling by the legislature, the \nexecutive branch, and the judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising political control \nover them. In early 1990, for example, the Bush administration approved a Food and Drug \nAdministration regulation that limited disease-prevention claims by food packagers, reversing a \nposition by the Reagan administration in 1987 permitting such claims. \n \nFigure 5.1 Major Administrative Agencies of the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n214 \n \n \nLegislative Control \nCongress can always pass a law repealing a regulation that an agency promulgates. Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control",

Describe the “exhaustion of remedies” requirement. \n2. Detail various strategies for obtaining judicial review of agency rules. \n3. Explain under what circumstances it is possible to sue the government. \n \n \nNeither an administrative agency’s adjudication nor its issuance of a regulation is necessarily final. Most \nfederal agency decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts. To get to court, the appellant must \novercome numerous complex hurdles. He or she must have standing—that is, be in some sense directly \naffected by the decision or regulation. The case must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as \nfurther appeal within the agency must have been exhausted. \n \nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n224 \nBefore you can complain to court about an agency’s action, you must first try to get the agency to \nreconsider its action. Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing examiner level, there \nmust have been a decision reached that was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the decision \nto the full board. The full board must rule against you, and only then will you be heard by a court. The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose. See Section 5.6 \n\"Cases\", American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan. \n \nIn summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) \nchallenge agency action where such action is the following: \n \n• \nnot in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority \n• \nnot in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act \n• \nnot in accordance with the substantial evidence test \n• \nunwarranted by the facts \n•",

The inspector \nanswered no, but that Barlow’s, Inc., had simply turned up in the agency’s selection process. The inspector \nagain asked to enter the nonpublic area of the business; Mr. Barlow’s response was to inquire whether the \ninspector had a search warrant. \nThe inspector had none. Thereupon, Mr. Barlow refused the inspector admission to the employee area of \nhis business. He said he was relying on his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. \n \nThree months later, the Secretary petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to \nissue an order compelling Mr. Barlow to admit the inspector. The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries \n“long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. \n72, 74, 77 (1970). These cases are indeed exceptions, but they represent responses to relatively unique \ncircumstances. Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise. Liquor \n(Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a \nbusiness, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation. \n \n* * * \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n231 \nThe clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved \nin Colonnade and Biswell is the exception.

Invoking the Walsh-\nHealey Act of 1936, 41 U.S.C. § 35 et seq., the Secretary attempts to support a conclusion that all \nbusinesses involved in interstate commerce have long been subjected to close supervision of employee \nsafety and health conditions.

Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison). States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense. If Barney (who has poor sight), shoots at a tree stump, thinking it is his \nneighbor, Ralph, intending to kill him, has he committed an attempt? Many courts would hold that he has \nnot. But the distinction between factual impossibility and legal impossibility is not always clear, and the \ntrend seems to be to punish the intended attempt. \n \nConspiracy \nUnder both federal and state laws, it is a separate offense to work with others toward the commission of a \ncrime. When two or more people combine to carry out an unlawful purpose, they are engaged in a \nconspiracy. The law of conspiracy is quite broad, especially when it is used by prosecutors in connection \nwith white-collar crimes. Many people can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is unnecessary \nto show that the actions they took were sufficient to constitute either the crime or an attempt. Usually, the \nprosecution needs to show only (1) an agreement and (2) a single overt act in furtherance of the \nconspiracy. Thus if three people agree to rob a bank, and if one of them goes to a store to purchase a gun \nto be used in the holdup, the three can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery. Even the purchase \nof an automobile to be used as the getaway car could support a conspiracy conviction. \n \nThe act of any one of the conspirators is imputed to the other members of the conspiracy. It does not \nmatter, for instance, that only one of the bank robbers fired the gun that killed a guard. All can be \nconvicted of murder. That is so even if one of the conspirators was stationed as a lookout several blocks \naway and even if he specifically told the others that his agreement to cooperate would end “just as soon as \nthere is shooting.” \n \nAgency and Corporations \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n257 \nA person can be guilty of a crime if he acts through another. Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the \nguilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But imputation of guilt is not \nlimited to a conspiracy. The agent may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate officer \ndirects a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home. The employee \nreasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains \nmoney that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit. The law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in recent years. The tendency is to hold \nthe corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group \nwithin the corporation (the president or board of directors). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAlthough proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by \ninference (circumstantially). Conspirators may not actually commit a crime, for example, but in preparing for a \ncriminal act, they may be guilty of the crime of conspiracy.

Explain why criminal law generally requires that the defendant charged with a crime have criminal \"intent.\" \n2. Know and explain the possible excuses relating to responsibility that are legally recognized by courts, \nincluding lack of capacity. \n \n \nIn General \nThe mens rea requirement depends on the nature of the crime and all the circumstances surrounding the \nact. In general, though, the requirement means that the accused must in some way have intended the \ncriminal consequences of his act. Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison capsule to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n259 \nswallow. That is the act. If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his \nstate of mind was. Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her, the act was murder. \nWhat if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison but believing that it would only make her \nmildly ill? The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that \nmay cause harm to others. But suppose that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her two \npills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) \nbut that turned out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he had neither intent nor a state of \nknowledge from which intent could be inferred. \n \nNot every criminal law requires criminal intent as an ingredient of the crime. Many regulatory codes \ndealing with the public health and safety impose strict requirements. Failure to adhere to such \nrequirements is a violation, whether or not the violator had mens rea. The United States v. \nPark case, Section 6.7 \"Cases\", a decision of the US Supreme Court, shows the different considerations \ninvolved in mens rea. \n \nExcuses That Limit or Overcome Responsibility \nMistake of Fact and Mistake of Law \nOrdinarily, ignorance of the law is not an excuse. If you believe that it is permissible to turn right on a red \nlight but the city ordinance prohibits it, your belief, even if reasonable, does not excuse your violation of \nthe law. Under certain circumstances, however, ignorance of law will be excused. If a statute imposes \ncriminal penalties for an action taken without a license, and if the government official responsible for \nissuing the license formally tells you that you do not need one (though in fact you do), a conviction for \nviolating the statute cannot stand. In rare cases, a lawyer’s advice, contrary to the statute, will be held to \nexcuse the client, but usually the client is responsible for his attorney’s mistakes. Otherwise, as it is said, \nthe lawyer would be superior to the law. \n \nIgnorance or mistake of fact more frequently will serve as an excuse. If you take a coat from a restaurant, \nbelieving it to be yours, you cannot be convicted of larceny if it is not. Your honest mistake of fact negates \nthe requisite intent. In general, the rule is that a mistaken belief of fact will excuse criminal responsibility \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n260 \nif (1) the belief is honestly held, (2) it is reasonable to hold it, and (3) the act would not have been criminal \nif the facts were as the accused supposed them to have been. \n \nEntrapment \nOne common technique of criminal investigation is the use of an undercover agent or decoy—the \npoliceman who poses as a buyer of drugs from a street dealer or the elaborate “sting” operations in which \nostensibly stolen goods are “sold” to underworld “fences.” Sometimes these methods are the only way by \nwhich certain kinds of crime can be rooted out and convictions secured. \n \nBut a rule against entrapment limits the legal ability of the police to play the role of criminals. The \npolice are permitted to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are not permitted to do so to",

The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis. In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of \nwhom is appointed for every federal district. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n263 \nFollowing the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document \nstating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury for \nan indictment. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence. The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment. The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff \nwill have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n264 \nFollowing a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will impose a sentence after presentencing \nreports are written by various court officials (often, probation officers). Permissible sentences are \nspelled out in statutes, though these frequently give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., \ntwenty years to life). The judge may sentence the defendant to imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may \ndecide to suspend sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence as long as he stays \nout of trouble). \n \nSentencing usually comes before appeal. As in civil cases, the defendant, now convicted, has the right \nto take at least one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and constitutional rights may \nbe argued. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCriminal procedure in US courts is designed to provide a fair process to both criminal defendants and to \nsociety.

Mills \n96 Ariz. 377, 396 P.2d 5 (Ariz. 1964) \n \nLOCKWOOD, VICE CHIEF JUSTICE \n \nDefendants appeal from a conviction on two counts of obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of \nAR.S. §§ 13-661.A3. and 13-663.A1. The material facts, viewed “…in the light most favorable to sustaining \nthe conviction,” are as follows: Defendant William Mills was a builder and owned approximately 150 \nhomes in Tucson in December, 1960. Mills conducted his business in his home. In 1960 defendant \nWinifred Mills, his wife, participated in the business generally by answering the telephone, typing, and \nreceiving clients who came to the office. \n \nIn December 1960, Mills showed the complainant, Nathan Pivowar, a house at 1155 Knox Drive and \nanother at 1210 Easy Street, and asked Pivowar if he would loan money on the Knox Drive house. Pivowar \ndid not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction. Later in the same month \nNathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan $5,000 and $4,000 \non the two houses. Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes \nagain. \n \nMills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar. Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office \nMrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation. After the mortgages had been recorded on \nDecember 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for $5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage \nformerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of $3,000. In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two \npersonal notes in the sums of $5,250.00 and $4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan. \n \nAlthough the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did \nnot present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them. In 1962 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n270 \nthe complainant learned that the mortgages which he had taken as security in the transaction were not \nfirst mortgages on the Knox Drive and Easy Street properties. These mortgages actually covered two \nvacant lots on which there were outstanding senior mortgages. On learning this, Pivowar signed a \ncomplaint charging the defendants with the crime of theft by false pretenses. \n \nOn appeal defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the \ninformation. They urge that a permanent taking of property must be proved in order to establish the \ncrime of theft. Since the complainant had the right to sue on the defendants’ notes, the defendants assert \nthat complainant cannot be said to have been deprived of his property permanently. Defendants \nmisconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses. Stated in a different form, their \nargument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second \nmortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan. \n \nDefendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction. \nRespectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit. A creditor has a \nright to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor. In the former \ncase, he has a right to know about the security. If he extends credit in reliance upon security which is \nfalsely represented to be adequate, he has been defrauded even if the debtor intends to repay the debt. His \nposition is now that of an unsecured creditor. At the very least, an unreasonable risk of loss has been \nforced upon him by reason of the deceit. This risk which he did not intend to assume has been imposed \nupon him by the intentional act of the debtor, and such action constitutes an intent to defraud. \n \n* * * \n \nThe cases cited by defendants in support of their contention are distinguishable from the instant case in \nthat they involved theft by larceny. Since the crime of larceny is designed to protect a person’s possessory \ninterest in property whereas the crime of false pretenses protects one’s title interest, the requirement of a \npermanent deprivation is appropriate to the former. Accordingly, we hold that an intent to repay a loan \nobtained on the basis of a false representation of the security for the loan is no defense. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n271 \n \n* * * \n \nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nWe granted certiorari to consider whether the jury instructions in the prosecution of a corporate officer \nunder § 301 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1042, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 331 \n(k), were appropriate under United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943). Acme Markets, Inc., is a \nnational retail food chain with approximately 36,000 employees, 874 retail outlets, 12 general \nwarehouses, and four special warehouses. Its headquarters, including the office of the president, \nrespondent Park, who is chief executive officer of the corporation, are located in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. In a five-count information filed in the United States District Court for the District of \nMaryland, the Government charged Acme and respondent with violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act. Each count of the information alleged that the defendants had received food that had been \nshipped in interstate commerce and that, while the food was being held for sale in Acme’s Baltimore \nwarehouse following shipment in interstate commerce, they caused it to be held in a building accessible to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n272 \nrodents and to be exposed to contamination by rodents. These acts were alleged to have resulted in the \nfood’s being adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. §§ 342 (a)(3) and (4), in violation of 21 U.S.C. § \n331 (k). \n \nAcme pleaded guilty to each count of the information. Respondent pleaded not guilty. The evidence at \ntrial demonstrated that in April 1970 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised respondent by \nletter of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. In 1971 the FDA found that similar \nconditions existed in the firm’s Baltimore warehouse. An FDA consumer safety officer testified concerning \nevidence of rodent infestation and other insanitary conditions discovered during a 12-day inspection of \nthe Baltimore warehouse in November and December 1971. He also related that a second inspection of the \nwarehouse had been conducted in March 1972. On that occasion the inspectors found that there had been \nimprovement in the sanitary conditions, but that “there was still evidence of rodent activity in the building \nand in the warehouses and we found some rodent-contaminated lots of food items.” \n \nThe Government also presented testimony by the Chief of Compliance of the FDA’s Baltimore office, who \ninformed respondent by letter of the conditions at the Baltimore warehouse after the first inspection. \nThere was testimony by Acme’s Baltimore division vice president, who had responded to the letter on \nbehalf of Acme and respondent and who described the steps taken to remedy the insanitary conditions \ndiscovered by both inspections. The Government’s final witness, Acme’s vice president for legal affairs \nand assistant secretary, identified respondent as the president and chief executive officer of the company \nand read a bylaw prescribing the duties of the chief executive officer. He testified that respondent \nfunctioned by delegating “normal operating duties” including sanitation, but that he retained “certain \nthings, which are the big, broad, principles of the operation of the company and had “the responsibility of \nseeing that they all work together.” \n \nAt the close of the Government’s case in chief, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \nground that “the evidence in chief has shown that Mr. Park is not personally concerned in this Food and \nDrug violation.” The trial judge denied the motion, stating that United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 \n(1943), was controlling. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n273 \n \nRespondent was the only defense witness. He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating",

Such special relationships are \npredicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies \nthe imposition of a duty to act.” W.

The authors of the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 A, comment b (1965), state that “the law \nappears…to be working slowly toward a recognition of the duty to aid or protect in any relation of \ndependence or of mutual dependence.” \n… \n \nIII. \nThe present case involves the alleged negligent failure to act, rather than negligent action. The plaintiff \ndoes not complain of any affirmative action taken by the University, but asserts instead that the \nUniversity owed to Whitlock the duty to assure that the fraternity’s trampoline was used only under \nsupervised conditions comparable to those in a gymnasium class, or in the alternative to cause the \ntrampoline to be removed from the front lawn of the Beta house.…If such a duty is to be recognized, it \nmust be grounded on a special relationship between the University and Whitlock. According to the \nevidence, there are only two possible sources of a special relationship out of which such a duty could arise \nin this case: the status of Whitlock as a student at the University, and the lease between the University and \nthe fraternity of which Whitlock was a member. We first consider the adequacy of the student-university \nrelationship as a possible basis for imposing a duty on the University to control or prohibit the use of the \ntrampoline, and then examine the provisions of the lease for that same purpose. \n \nA. \nThe student-university relationship has been scrutinized in several jurisdictions, and it is generally agreed \nthat a university is not an insurer of its students’ safety. [Citations] The relationship between a university \nand its students has experienced important change over the years. At one time, college administrators and \nfaculties stood in loco parentis to their students, which created a special relationship “that imposed a duty \non the college to exercise control over student conduct and, reciprocally, gave the students certain rights \nof protection by the college.” Bradshaw, 612 F.2d at 139. However, in modern times there has evolved a \ngradual reapportionment of responsibilities from the universities to the students, and a corresponding \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n317 \ndeparture from the in loco parentis relationship.

Beach, 726 P.2d at 419 (contrasting \ncolleges and universities with elementary and high schools). \n… \n…By imposing a duty on the University in this case, the University would be encouraged to exercise more \ncontrol over private student recreational choices, thereby effectively taking away much of the \nresponsibility recently recognized in students for making their own decisions with respect to private \nentertainment and personal safety. Such an allocation of responsibility would “produce a repressive and \ninhospitable environment, largely inconsistent with the objectives of a modern college \neducation.” Beach, 726 P.2d at 419. \n \nThe evidence demonstrates that only in limited instances has the University attempted to impose \nregulations or restraints on the private recreational pursuits of its students, and the students have not \nlooked to the University to assure the safety of their recreational choices. Nothing in the University’s \nstudent handbook, which contains certain regulations concerning student conduct, reflects an effort by \nthe University to control the risk-taking decisions of its students in their private recreation.…Indeed, \nfraternity and sorority self-governance with minimal supervision appears to have been fostered by the \nUniversity. \n \n… \n \nAside from advising the Beta house on one occasion to put the trampoline up when not in use, there is no \nevidence that the University officials attempted to assert control over trampoline use by the fraternity \nmembers.

By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law. One of its first projects, and ultimately one of its most \nsuccessful, was the drafting of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts, completed in 1932. A \nrevision—the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979. \nThe Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, \nrestitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field. These analyses are \nmade with an eye to discerning the various principles that have emerged from the courts, and to the \nmaximum extent possible, the Restatements declare the law as the courts have determined it to be. The \nRestatements, guided by a Reporter (the director of the project) and a staff of legal scholars, go through \nseveral so-called “tentative” drafts—sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty—and are screened by various \ncommittees within the American Law Institute before they are eventually published as final documents. \n \nThe Restatement of Contracts won prompt respect in the courts and has been cited in innumerable cases. \nThe Restatements are not authoritative, in the sense that they are not actual judicial precedents, but they \nare nevertheless weighty interpretive texts, and judges frequently look to them for guidance. They are as \nclose to “black letter” rules of law as exist anywhere in the American legal system for judge-made \n(common) law. \n \nStatutory Law: The Uniform Commercial Code \nCommon law contract principles govern contracts for real estate and for services, obviously very \nimportant areas of law. But in one area the common law has been superseded by an important statute: the \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC), especially Article 2, which deals with the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n332 \nA Brief History \nThe UCC is a model law developed by the American law Institute and the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws; it has been adopted in one form or another in all fifty states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the American territories. It is the only “national” law not enacted by Congress. \n \nBefore the UCC was written, commercial law varied, sometimes greatly, from state to state. This first \nproved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to business as the American economy became \nnationwide during the twentieth century. Although there had been some uniform laws concerned with \ncommercial deals—including the Uniform Sales Act, first published in 1906—few were widely adopted and \nnone nationally. As a result, the law governing sales of goods, negotiable instruments, warehouse receipts, \nsecurities, and other matters crucial to doing business in an industrial, market economy was a crazy quilt \nof untidy provisions that did not mesh well from state to state. \n \nInitial drafting of the UCC began in 1942 and was ten years in the making, involving the efforts of \nhundreds of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and judges. A final draft, promulgated by the Institute and \nthe Conference, was endorsed by the American Bar Association and published in 1951. \n \nPennsylvania enacted the code in its entirety in 1953. It was the only state to enact the original version, \nbecause the Law Revision Commission of the New York State legislature began to examine it line by line \nand had serious objections. Three years later, in 1956, a revised code was issued. This version, known as \nthe 1957 Official Text, was enacted in Massachusetts and Kentucky. In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform. Responding to this development the American Law Institute \nestablished a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code. Various subcommittees \nwent to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published. Twelve more states adopted",

The offeree must manifest his \nassent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer. Complications arise when an \noffer is accepted indirectly through correspondence. Although offers and revocations of offers are not \neffective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner \nspecified by the offeror. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n343 \n \nIf the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the \nofferee uses a reasonable method of acceptance. It is implied that the offeree can use the same means used \nby the offeror or a means of communication customary to the industry. For example, the use of the postal \nservice was so customary that acceptances are considered effective when mailed, regardless of the method \nused to transmit the offer. Indeed, the so-called “mailbox rule” (the acceptance is effective upon dispatch) \nhas an ancient lineage, tracing back nearly two hundred years to the English courts. [2] \nConsideration \nConsideration, is the quid pro quo (something given or received for something else) between the \ncontracting parties in the absence of which the law will not enforce the promise or promises made. \nConsider the following three “contracts”: \n \n1. Betty offers to give a book to Lou. Lou accepts. \n2. Betty offers Lou the book in exchange for Lou’s promise to pay $15. Lou accepts. \n3. Betty offers to give Lou the book if Lou promises to pick it up at Betty’s house. Lou accepts. \n \nThe question is which, if any, is a binding contract? In American law, only situation 2 is a binding \ncontract, because only that contract contains a set of mutual promises in which each party pledges to give \nup something to the benefit of the other. \n \nThe question of what constitutes a binding contract has been answered differently throughout history and \nin other cultures. For example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing was binding, \nwhether or not there was consideration in our sense. Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of \ngifts were made binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the United States. And in \nthe Anglo-American tradition, the presence of a seal was once sufficient to make a contract binding \nwithout any other consideration. In most states, the seal is no longer a substitute for consideration, \nalthough in some states it creates a presumption of consideration. The Uniform Commercial Code has \nabolished the seal on contracts for the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n344 \nThe existence of consideration is determined by examining whether the person against whom a promise is \nto be enforced (the promisor) received something in return from the person to whom he made the \npromise (the promisee). That may seem a simple enough question. But as with much in the law, the \ncomplicating situations are never very far away. The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor. Whether \nconsideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to \nmake the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment. (Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the \npromisor is sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did \nthe promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise? Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting. In the third example, \nwhat might appear to be such a promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou \ncome to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift. Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book.",

Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages. When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n352 \nprice as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in \nthe event of breach. \n \nIncidental Damages \nSuppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search. After one year the \nprofessor quits to take a job elsewhere, in breach of her contract. If City College has to pay $5000 more to \nfind a replacement for year, Blake is liable for that amount—that’s compensatory damages. But what if it \ncosts City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and interview a replacement? City College can \nclaim that, too, as incidental damages which include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching \nparty after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. \n \nPunitive Damages \nPunitive damages are those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a civil action, in \nwhich criminal sanctions may be unavailable. They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; \nthey are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to \ndeter others from acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, \npunitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is \nalso a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of \ntorts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, \ndeliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some \nkinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security \nunder a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor \nwas not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort of conversion. Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law. The judge or jury may award at its discretion whatever sum is",

A bank cashier who becomes known as a gambler may be \nfired. \n \nDuty to Keep and Render Accounts \nThe agent must keep accurate financial records, take receipts, and otherwise act in conformity to standard \nbusiness practices. \n \nDuty to Act Only as Authorized \nThis duty states a truism but is one for which there are limits. A principal’s wishes may have been stated \nambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts \nreasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately \nrepudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to \nhim, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to \nliability to the principal.”[3] \n \nDuty Not to Attempt the Impossible or Impracticable \nThe principal says to the agent, “Keep working until the job is done.” The agent is not obligated to go \nwithout food or sleep because the principal misapprehended how long it would take to complete the job. \nNor should the agent continue to expend the principal’s funds in a quixotic attempt to gain business, sign \nup customers, or produce inventory when it is reasonably clear that such efforts would be in vain. \n \nDuty to Obey \nAs a general rule, the agent must obey reasonable directions concerning the manner of performance. \nWhat is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n385 \nprincipal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency. A principal may prescribe uniforms for \nvarious classes of employees, for instance, and a manufacturing company may tell its sales force what \nsales pitch to use on customers. On the other hand, certain tasks entrusted to agents are not subject to the \nprincipal’s control; for example, a lawyer may refuse to permit a client to dictate courtroom tactics. \n \nDuty to Give Information \nBecause the principal cannot be every place at once—that is why agents are hired, after all—much that is \nvital to the principal’s business first comes to the attention of agents. If the agent has actual notice or \nreason to know of information that is relevant to matters entrusted to him, he has a duty to inform the \nprincipal. This duty is especially critical because information in the hands of an agent is, under most \ncircumstances, imputed to the principal, whose legal liabilities to third persons may hinge on receiving \ninformation in timely fashion. Service of process, for example, requires a defendant to answer within a \ncertain number of days; an agent’s failure to communicate to the principal that a summons has been \nserved may bar the principal’s right to defend a lawsuit. The imputation to the principal of knowledge \npossessed by the agent is strict: even where the agent is acting adversely to the principal’s interests—for \nexample, by trying to defraud his employer—a third party may still rely on notification to the agent, unless \nthe third party knows the agent is acting adversely. \n \n“Shop Rights” Doctrine \nIn Grip Nut Co. v. Sharp, Sharp made a deal with Grip Nut Company that in return for a salary and \nbonuses as company president, he would assign to the company any inventions he made. [4] When the five-\nyear employment contract expired, Sharp continued to serve as chief executive officer, but no new \ncontract was negotiated concerning either pay or rights to inventions. During the next ten years, Sharp \ninvented a number of new products and developed new machinery to manufacture them; patent rights \nwent to the company. However, he made one invention with two other employees and they assigned the \npatent to him. A third employee invented a safety device and also assigned the patent to Sharp. At one \ntime, Sharp’s son invented a leakproof bolt and a process to manufacture it; these, too, were assigned to \nSharp. These inventions were developed in the company’s plants at its expense. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n386 \nWhen Sharp died, his family claimed the rights to the inventions on which Sharp held assignments and \nsued the company, which used the inventions, for patent infringement. The family reasoned that after the \nexpiration of the employment contract, Sharp was employed only in a managerial capacity, not as an \ninventor. The court disagreed and invoked the shop rights doctrine, under which an invention \n“developed and perfected in [a company’s] plant with its time, materials, and appliances, and wholly at its",

In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event \nthe employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old \ncommon-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been \nstatutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is \ntherefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage. \n \nThose frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and public employees; public employees, \nfederal workers, and railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but similar laws. The \ntrend has been to include more and more classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide \ncoverage for household workers, although the threshold of coverage varies widely from state to state. \nSome use an earnings test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall within the domestic \ncategory include maids, baby-sitters, gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers, electricians, \nand other independent contractors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n391 \n \nPaying for Workers’ Compensation \nThere are three general methods by which employers may comply with workers’ compensation laws. First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31. [6] \n \nRecurring Legal Issues \nThere are a number of legal issues that recur in workers’ compensation cases. The problem is, from the \nemployer’s point of view, that the cost of buying insurance is tied to the number of claims made. The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n•",

Microsoft Corp. \n97 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir. 1996) \n \nReinhardt, J. \n \nLarge corporations have increasingly adopted the practice of hiring temporary employees or \nindependent contractors as a means of avoiding payment of employee benefits, and thereby increasing \ntheir profits. This practice has understandably led to a number of problems, legal and otherwise. One of \nthe legal issues that sometimes arises is exemplified by this lawsuit. The named plaintiffs, who were \nclassified by Microsoft as independent contractors, seek to strip that label of its protective covering and \nto obtain for themselves certain benefits that the company provided to all of its regular or permanent \nemployees. After certifying the named plaintiffs as representatives of a class of “common-law \nemployees,” the district court granted summary judgment to Microsoft on all counts. The \nplaintiffs…now appeal as to two of their claims: a) the claim…that they are entitled to savings benefits \nunder Microsoft’s Savings Plus Plan (SPP); and b) that…they are entitled to stock-option benefits under \nMicrosoft’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). In both cases, the claims are based on their \ncontention that they are common-law employees. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n399 \nMicrosoft, one of the country’s fastest growing and most successful corporations and the world’s largest \nsoftware company, produces and sells computer software internationally. It employs a core staff of \npermanent employees. It categorizes them as “regular employees” and offers them a wide variety of \nbenefits, including paid vacations, sick leave, holidays, short-term disability, group health and life \ninsurance, and pensions, as well as the two benefits involved in this appeal. Microsoft supplements its \ncore staff of employees with a pool of individuals to whom it refuses to pay fringe benefits. It previously \nclassified these individuals as “independent contractors” or “freelancers,” but prior to the filing of the \naction began classifying them as “temporary agency employees.” Freelancers were hired when Microsoft \nneeded to expand its workforce to meet the demands of new product schedules. The company did not, of \ncourse, provide them with any of the employee benefits regular employees receive. \n \nThe plaintiffs…performed services as software testers, production editors, proofreaders, formatters and \nindexers. Microsoft fully integrated the plaintiffs into its workforce: they often worked on teams along \nwith regular employees, sharing the same supervisors, performing identical functions, and working the \nsame core hours. Because Microsoft required that they work on site, they received admittance card keys, \noffice equipment and supplies from the company. \n \nFreelancers and regular employees, however, were not without their obvious distinctions. Freelancers \nwore badges of a different color, had different electronic-mail addresses, and attended a less formal \norientation than that provided to regular employees. They were not permitted to assign their work to \nothers, invited to official company functions, or paid overtime wages. In addition, they were not paid \nthrough Microsoft’s payroll department. Instead, they submitted invoices for their services, documenting \ntheir hours and the projects on which they worked, and were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment. \nThe plaintiffs were told when they were hired that, as freelancers, they would not be eligible for benefits. \nNone has contended that Microsoft ever promised them any benefits individually. All eight named \nplaintiffs signed [employment agreements] when first hired by Microsoft or soon thereafter.

Microsoft agreed.… \n \nAfter learning of the IRS rulings, the plaintiffs sought various employee benefits, including those now at \nissue: the ESPP and SPP benefits. The SPP…is a cash or deferred salary arrangement under § 401k of the \nInternal Revenue Code that permits Microsoft’s employees to save and invest up to fifteen percent of their \nincome through tax-deferred payroll deductions.…Microsoft matches fifty percent of the employee’s \ncontribution in any year, with [a maximum matching contribution].

The plaintiffs, however, were not freelancers or independent contractors. They \nwere common-law employees, and the question is what, if anything, Microsoft intended with respect to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n401 \npersons who were actually common-law employees but were not known to Microsoft to be such. The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status. Indeed, Microsoft has pointed to no \nevidence suggesting that it ever denied eligibility to any employees, whom it understood to be common-\nlaw employees, by paying them through the accounts receivable department or otherwise. \n \nWe therefore construe the ambiguity in the plan against Microsoft and hold that the plaintiffs are eligible \nto participate under the terms of the SPP. \n \n[Next, regarding the ESPP] we hold that the plaintiffs…are covered by the specific provisions of the ESPP. \nWe apply the “objective manifestation theory of contracts,” which requires us to “impute an intention \ncorresponding to the reasonable meaning of a person’s words and acts.” [Citation] Through its \nincorporation of the tax code provision into the plan, Microsoft manifested an objective intent to make all \ncommon-law employees, and hence the plaintiffs, eligible for participation.

In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a \nnew logo for the hotel’s stationery. Andy has no implied authority to change the name or to commission \nthe artist, though he does have implied authority to engage a printer to replenish the stationery supply—\nand possibly to make some design changes in the letterhead. \n \nEven when there is no implied authority, in an emergency the agent may act in ways that would in the \nnormal course require specific permission from the principal. If unforeseen circumstances arise and it is \nimpracticable to communicate with the principal to find out what his wishes would be, the agent may do \nwhat is reasonably necessary in order to prevent substantial loss to his principal. During World War II, \nEastern Wine Corporation marketed champagne in a bottle with a diagonal red stripe that infringed the \ntrademark of a French producer.

The contract between producer and importer required the \nlatter to notify the French company whenever a competitor appeared to be infringing its rights and to \nrecommend steps by which the company could stop the infringement. The authority to institute suit was \nnot expressly conferred, and ordinarily the right to do so would not be inferred. Because France was under \nGerman occupation, however, the importer was unable to communicate with the producer, its principal. \nThe court held that the importer could file suit to enjoin Eastern Wine from continuing to display the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n420 \ninfringing red diagonal stripe, since legal action was “essential to the preservation of the principal’s \nproperty.” [3] \n \nThe rule that a person’s position can carry with it implied authority is fundamental to American business \npractice. But outside the United States this rule is not applicable, and the business executive traveling \nabroad should be aware that in civil-law countries it is customary to present proof of authority to transact \ncorporate business—usually in the form of a power of attorney. This is not always an easy task. Not only \nmust the power of the traveling executive be shown but the right of the corporate officer back in the \nUnited States to delegate authority must also be proven. \n \nApparent Authority \nIn the agency relationship, the agent’s actions in dealing with third parties will affect the legal rights of the \nprincipal. What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel. Estoppel is the doctrine \nthat a person will not now be allowed to deny a promise or assertion she previously made where there has \nbeen detrimental reliance on that promise or assertion.

Name special cases of vicarious liability. \n6. Describe the principal’s liability for crimes committed by the agent. \n \n \n \nPrincipal’s Tort Liability \nThe Distinction between Direct and Vicarious Liability \nWhen is the principal liable for injuries that the agent causes another to suffer? \n \nDirect Liability \nThere is a distinction between torts prompted by the principal himself and torts of which the principal \nwas innocent. If the principal directed the agent to commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the \nagent’s carrying out his instructions would bring harm to someone, the principal is liable. This is an \napplication of the general common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by delegating an \nunlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls \nthe trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in his use of agents will be held liable for their \nnegligence. This rule comes into play when the principal fails to supervise employees adequately, gives \nfaulty directions, or hires incompetent or unsuitable people for a particular job. Imposing liability on the \nprincipal in these cases is readily justifiable since it is the principal’s own conduct that is the underlying \nfault; the principal here is directly liable. \n \nVicarious Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n424 \nBut the principle of liability for one’s agent is much broader, extending to acts of which the principal had \nno knowledge, that he had no intention to commit nor involvement in, and that he may in fact have \nexpressly prohibited the agent from engaging in. This is the principle of respondeat superior (“let the \nmaster answer”) or the master-servant doctrine, which imposes on the \nprincipal vicarious liability (vicarious means “indirectly, as, by, or through a substitute”) under which \nthe principal is responsible for acts committed by the agent within the scope of the employment \n(see Figure 10.2 \"Principal’s Tort Liability\"). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10.2 Principal’s Tort Liability \n \n \nThe modern basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed the “deep pocket” theory: the principal \n(usually a corporation) has deeper pockets than the agent, meaning that it has the wherewithal to pay for \nthe injuries traceable one way or another to events it set in motion. A million-dollar industrial accident is \nwithin the means of a company or its insurer; it is usually not within the means of the agent—employee—\nwho caused it. \n \nThe “deep pocket” of the defendant-company is not always very deep, however. For many small \nbusinesses, in fact, the principle of respondeat superior is one of life or death. One example was the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n425 \nclosing in San Francisco of the much-beloved Larraburu Brothers Bakery—at the time, the world’s second \nlargest sourdough bread maker. The bakery was held liable for $2 million in damages after one of its \ndelivery trucks injured a six-year-old boy. The bakery’s insurance policy had a limit of $1.25 million, and \nthe bakery could not absorb the excess. The Larraburus had no choice but to cease operations. \n(Seehttp://www.outsidelands.org/larraburu.php.) \n \nRespondeat superior raises three difficult questions: (1) What type of agents can create tort liability for \nthe principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked.

Meanwhile, the public, obliged to deal or come in \ncontact with his agent, for injuries done by them must be left wholly without redress. He might \ndelegate to persons pecuniarily irresponsible the care of large factories, of extensive mines, of \nships at sea, or of railroad trains on land, and these persons, by the use of the extensive power \nthus committed to them, might inflict wanton and malicious injuries on third persons, without \nother restraint than that which springs from the imperfect execution of the criminal laws. A \ndoctrine so fruitful of mischief could not long stand unshaken in an enlightened jurisprudence.’ \nThis court has often held the master liable, even if the agent was willful, provided it was \ncommitted in the course of his employment. [Citation]” \n \n“The act of a servant done to effect some independent purpose of his own and not with reference \nto the service in which he is employed, or while he is acting as his own master for the time being, \nis not within the scope of his employment so as to render the master liable therefor. In these \ncircumstances the servant alone is liable for the injury inflicted.” [Citation].…”The general idea is \nthat the employee at the time of doing the wrongful act, in order to fix liability on the employer, \nmust have been acting in behalf of the latter and not on his own account [Citation].” \n \nThe principal physical (as opposed to psychic) damage to the plaintiff is a number of disfiguring knife \nwounds on her head, face, arms, breasts and body. If the instrumentalities of assault had not included \nrape, the case would provoke no particular curiosity nor interest because it comes within all the classic \nrequirements for recovery against the master. The verdict is not attacked as excessive, and could not be \nexcessive in light of the physical injuries inflicted. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n446 \n \nIt may be suggested that [some of the cases discussed] are distinguishable because in each of those cases \nthe plaintiff was a business visitor on the defendant’s “premises.”…Home delivery customers are usually \nin their homes, sometimes alone; and deliveries of merchandise may expose householders to one-on-one \nconfrontations with deliverymen.

However, \nif the assault, sexual or otherwise, was triggered off or motivated or occasioned by a dispute over the \nconduct then and there of the employer’s business, then the employer should be liable. \n \nIt is, then, a question of fact for the trier of fact, rather than a question of law for the court, whether the \nassault stemmed from purely and solely personal sources or arose out of the conduct of the employer’s \nbusiness; and the trial judge so instructed the jury. \n \nIt follows that, under existing decisions of the District of Columbia Circuit, plaintiff has made out a case \nfor the jury against Pep Line Trucking, Inc. unless the sexual character of one phase of the assault bars her \nfrom recovery for damages from all phases of the assault.",

Cockrell contends Officer James’s action of hugging Cockrell \nwas similar to an officer consoling a victim of a crime. Cockrell does admit that Officer James’s action of \nkissing her is more difficult to view as within the course and scope of his employment… \n \nThe District argues that although Officer James acted within the course and scope of his duties when he \narrested Cockrell, his later conduct, which was intended to satisfy his lustful desires, was outside the \nscope of his employment with it.… \n \n“Mississippi law provides that an activity must be in furtherance of the employer’s business to be within \nthe scope and course of employment.” [Citation] To be within the course and scope of employment, an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n450 \nactivity must carry out the employer’s purpose of the employment or be in furtherance of the employer’s \nbusiness.

Describe the creation of an express partnership. \n2. Describe the creation of an implied partnership. \n3. Identify tests of partnership existence. \n4. Understand partnership by estoppel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n464 \n \nCreation of an Express Partnership \nCreation in General \nThe most common way of forming a partnership is expressly—that is, in words, orally or in writing. Such a \npartnership is called an express partnership. If parties have an express partnership with no \npartnership agreement, the relevant law—the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA)—applies the governing rules. \n \nAssume that three persons have decided to form a partnership to run a car dealership. Able contributes \n$250,000. Baker contributes the building and space in which the business will operate. Carr contributes \nhis services; he will manage the dealership. \n \nThe first question is whether Able, Baker, and Carr must have a partnership agreement. As should be clear \nfrom the foregoing discussion, no agreement is necessary as long as the tests of partnership are met. \nHowever, they ought to have an agreement in order to spell out their rights and duties among themselves. \n \nThe agreement itself is a contract and should follow the principles and rules spelled out in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" of this book. Because it is intended to govern the relations of the partners toward themselves \nand their business, every partnership contract should set forth clearly the following terms: (1) the name \nunder which the partners will do business; (2) the names of the partners; (3) the nature, scope, and \nlocation of the business; (4) the capital contributions of each partner; (5) how profits and losses are to be \ndivided; (6) how salaries, if any, are to be determined; (7) the responsibilities of each partner for \nmanaging the business; (8) limitations on the power of each partner to bind the firm; (9) the method by \nwhich a given partner may withdraw from the partnership; (10) continuation of the firm in the event of a \npartner’s death and the formula for paying a partnership interest to his heirs; and (11) method of \ndissolution. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n465 \nSpecific Issues of Concern \nIn forming a partnership, three of these items merit special attention. And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to",

Partnership rules generally \napply, although the relationship of the joint venturers is closer to that of special than general agency as discussed \nin Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". Joint venturers are fiduciaries toward one another. \nAlthough no formality is necessary, the associates will usually sign an agreement. The joint venture need have no \ngroup name, though it may have one. Property may be owned jointly. Profits and losses will be shared, as in a \npartnership, and each associate has the right to participate in management. Liability is unlimited. Sometimes two \nor more businesses will form a joint venture to carry out a specific task—prospecting for oil, building a nuclear \nreactor, doing basic scientific research—and will incorporate the joint venture. In that case, the resulting \nbusiness—known as a “joint venture corporation”—is governed by corporation law, not the law of partnership, \nand is not a joint venture in the sense described here. Increasingly, companies are forming joint ventures to do \nbusiness abroad; foreign investors or governments own significant interests in these joint ventures. For example, \nin 1984 General Motors entered into a joint venture with Toyota to revive GM’s shuttered Fremont, California, \nassembly plant to create New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). For GM the joint venture was an \nopportunity to learn about lean manufacturing from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first \nmanufacturing base in North America and a chance to test its production system in an American labor \nenvironment. Until May 2010, when the copartnership ended and the plant closed, NUMMI built an average of six \nthousand vehicles a week, or nearly eight million cars and trucks. These vehicles were the Chevrolet Nova (1984–\n88), the Geo Prizm (1989–97), the Chevrolet Prizm (1998–2002), and the Hilux (1991–95, predecessor of the \nTacoma), as well as the Toyota Voltz, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Pontiac Vibe.

The second one was based on this problem: \nShanahan and Loomis agreed that the cattle at issue were partnership cattle bearing the “52” brand. That \nis, the cows were not Shanahan’s; they were the partnership’s. When Whitehead moved to dismiss \nShanahan’s claim—again, because the cows weren’t Shanahan’s—Shanahan conceded that but for the \nexistence of the partnership he would have no claim against Whitehead. If there is no claim against the \ndefendant except insofar as he harmed the partnership business (the cattle), how could the majority assert \nthat claims against Whitehead did not arise out of “the business” conducted under 52 Cattle Company? \nWho has the better argument, the majority or the dissent? \n3. Here is another problem along the same lines but with a different set of facts and a Uniform Partnership \nAct (UPA) jurisdiction (i.e., pre–Revised Uniform Partnership Act [RUPA]). Suppose the plaintiffs had a \npartnership (as they did here), but the claim by one was that the other partner had stolen several head of \ncattle, and UPA was in effect so that the partnership property was owned as “tenant in partnership”—the \ncattle would be owned by the partners as a whole. A person who steals his own property cannot be \ncriminally liable; therefore, a partner cannot be guilty of stealing (or misappropriating) firm property. Thus \nunder UPA there arise anomalous cases, for example, in People v. Zinke, 555 N.E.2d 263 (N.Y. 1990), which \nis a criminal case, Zinke embezzled over a million dollars from his own investment firm but the prosecutor’s \ncase against him was dismissed because, the New York court said, “partners cannot be prosecuted for \nstealing firm property.” If the partnership is a legal entity, as under RUPA, how is this result changed? \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n480 \n \nPartnership by Estoppel \nChavers v. Epsco, Inc. \n98 S.W.3d 421 (Ark. 2003) \n \nHannah, J. \nAppellants Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers appeal a judgment entered against them by the Craighead \nCounty Circuit Court. Reggie and Mark argue that the trial court erred in holding them liable for a \ncompany debt based upon partnership by estoppel because the proof was vague and insufficient and there \nwas no detrimental reliance on the part of a creditor. We hold that the trial court was not clearly \nerroneous in finding liability based upon partnership by estoppel. Accordingly, we affirm. \n \nFacts \nGary Chavers operated Chavers Welding and Construction (“CWC”), a construction and welding business, \nin Jonesboro. Gary’s sons Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers joined their father in the business after \ngraduating from high school. Gary, Mark, and Reggie maintain that CWC was a sole proprietorship owned \nby Gary, and that Reggie and Mark served only as CWC employees, not as CWC partners. \n \nIn February 1999, CWC entered into an agreement with Epsco, Inc. (“Epsco”), a staffing service, to \nprovide payroll and employee services for CWC. Initially, Epsco collected payments for its services on a \nweekly basis, but later, Epsco extended credit to CWC. Melton Clegg, President of Epsco, stated that his \ndecision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was a partnership. \n \nCWC’s account with Epsco became delinquent, and Epsco filed a complaint against Gary, Reggie, and \nMark, individually, and doing business as CWC, to recover payment for the past due account. Gary \ndischarged a portion of his obligation to Epsco due to his filing for bankruptcy. Epsco sought to recover \nCWC’s remaining debt from Reggie and Mark. After a hearing on March 7, 2002, the trial court issued a \nletter opinion, finding that Reggie and Mark “represented themselves to [Epsco] as partners in an existing \npartnership and operated in such a fashion to give creditors in general, and Epsco in particular, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n481 \nimpression that such creditors/potential creditors were doing business with a partnership.…” On May 21, \n2002, the trial court entered an order stating that Reggie and Mark were partners by estoppel as relates to \nEpsco. The trial court found that Reggie and Mark were jointly and severally liable for the debt of CWC in \nthe amount of $80,360.92. In addition, the trial court awarded Epsco pre-judgment interest at the rate of \nsix percent, post-judgment interest at the rate of ten percent, and attorney’s fees in the amount of \n$8,036.92. \n \n[The relevant Arkansas statute provides]: \n \n(1) When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents to \nanother representing him to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership or with one (1) or \nmore persons not actual partners, he is liable to any person to whom such representation has \nbeen made, who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent \npartnership, and if he has made such representation or consented to its being made in a public",

In addition, he \ntestified that his signature was not at the bottom of the fax. He testified that his former secretary might \nhave signed his name to the fax; however, he stated that he did not authorize his secretary to sign or fax a \nlist of credit references to Epsco. Moreover, Gary testified that the first time he saw the list of credit \nreferences was at the bench trial. \n \nThis court gives deference to the superior position of the trial judge to determine the credibility of the \nwitnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony. [Citations] Though there was a dispute \nconcerning whether Gary faxed the list to Epsco, the trial court found that Epsco received the faxed credit \nreferences from CWC and relied on CWC’s statement that Reggie and Mark were partners.

The fax cover sheet contained the address, telephone \nnumber, and fax number of the business. Listed under this information was “Gary, Reggie, or Mark \nChavers.” Epsco argues that Gary, Reggie, and Mark are all listed on the fax cover sheet, and that this \nindicates that they were holding themselves out to the public as partners of the business. The trial court’s \nfinding that the fax cover sheet indicated that Reggie and Mark were holding themselves out as partners \nof CWC is not clearly erroneous. \n \nThe Epsco Personnel Credit Application \nEpsco introduced Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 9, a personnel credit application, which was received from CWC. \nAdams testified that the exhibit represented a completed credit application that she received from CWC. \nThe type of business checked on the credit application is “partnership.” Adams testified that the \napplication showed the company to be a partnership, and that this information was relied upon in \nextending credit. Clegg testified that he viewed the credit application which indicated that CWC was a \npartnership, and that his decision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was \na partnership. Gary denied filling out the credit application form. \n \nIt was within the trial court’s discretion to find Adams’s and Clegg’s testimony more credible than Gary’s \ntestimony and to determine that Epsco relied on the statement of partnership on the credit application \nbefore extending credit to CWC. The trial court’s finding concerning the credit application is not clearly \nerroneous. \n \n \n \nThe Checks to Epsco \nEpsco argues that Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 3 and Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 11, checks written to Epsco showing the \nCWC account to be in the name of “Gary A. or Reggie J. Chavers,” indicates that Reggie was holding \nhimself out to be a partner of CWC. Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 3 was signed by Gary, and Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 11 \nwas signed by Reggie. The checks are evidence that Reggie was holding himself out to the public as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n485 \npartner of CWC, and Epsco could have detrimentally relied on the checks before extending credit to CWC. \nThe trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the checks supported a finding of partnership by \nestoppel. \n \nThe Business Card \nEpsco introduced Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 4, a business card that states “Chavers Welding, Construction & \nCrane Service.” Listed on the card as “owners” are Gary Chavers and Reggie Chavers. Gary testified that \nthe business cards were printed incorrectly, and that Reggie’s name should not have been included as an \nowner. He also testified that some of the cards might have been handed out, and that it was possible that \nhe might have given one of the cards to a business listed as one of CWC’s credit references on Plaintiff’s \nExhibit # 1. \n \nThe business card listing Reggie as an owner indicates that Reggie was holding himself out as a partner. \nAs we stated in [Citation] when a person holds himself out as a member of partnership, any one dealing \nwith the firm on the faith of such representation is entitled to assume the relation continues until notice of \nsome kind is given of its discontinuance. There is no indication that Reggie ever informed any person who \nreceived a business card that the business relationship listed on the card was incorrect or had been \ndiscontinued.

Who is entitled to her share of the specific property, such as inventory, the \nbuilding, and the money in the cash register—her husband and children, or the other partners, Baker and \nCarr? Section 25(1) of UPA declares that the partners hold the partnership property \nas tenants in partnership. As spelled out in Section 25(2), the specific property interest of a tenant in \npartnership vests in the surviving partners, not in the heirs. But the heirs are entitled to the deceased \npartner’s interest in the partnership itself, so that while Baker and Carr may use the partnership property \nfor the benefit of the partnership without consulting Able’s heirs, they must account to her heirs for her \nproper share of the partnership’s profits. \n \n \n \nRights in Specific Property: RUPA Approach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n499 \nSection 501 of RUPA provides, “A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in \npartnership property which can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily.” Partnership property \nis owned by the entity; UPA’s concept of tenants in partnership is abolished in favor of adoption of the \nentity theory. The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights. A partner’s \n‘transferable interest’ is a more limited concept and means only his share of the profits and losses and \nright to receive distributions, that is, the partner’s economic interests.” [17] \n \nThis transferable interest is assignable under RUPA 503 (unless the partners agree to restrict transfers, \nSection 103(a)). It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty?

Understand the partners’ and partnership’s tort and criminal liability. \n3. Describe the partners’ and partnership’s tax liability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n505 \n \n \nBy express terms, the law of agency applies to partnership law. Every partner is an agent of the \npartnership for the purpose of its business. Consequently, the following discussion will be a review of \nagency law, covered in Chapter 11 \"Partnerships: General Characteristics and Formation\" as it applies to \npartnerships. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) adds a few new wrinkles to the liability issue. \n \nContract Liability \nLiability of the Partnership \nRecall that an agent can make contracts on behalf of a principal under three types of authority: express, \nimplied, and apparent. Express authority is that explicitly delegated to the agent, implied authority is \nthat necessary to the carrying out of the express authority, and apparent authority is that which a third \nparty is led to believe has been conferred by the principal on the agent, even though in fact it was not or it \nwas revoked. When a partner has authority, the partnership is bound by contracts the partner makes on \nits behalf. Section 12.4.2 \"Partnership Authority, Express or Apparent\", Hodge v. Garrett, discusses all \nthree types of authority. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 305 of RUPA restates agency law: “A partnership is liable for loss or injury, or for a penalty \nincurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the \nordinary course” [1] of partnership business or with its authority. The ability of a partner to bind the \npartnership to contract liability is problematic, especially where the authority is apparent: the firm denies \nliability, lawsuits ensue, and unhappiness generally follows. \n \nBut the firm is not liable for an act not apparently in the ordinary course of business, unless the act was \nauthorized by the others. [2] Section 401(j) of RUPA requires the unanimous consent of the partners for a \ngrant of authority outside the ordinary course of business, unless the partnership agreement provides \notherwise. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n506 \nUnder the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) Section 9(3), the firm is not liable for five actions that no single \npartner has implied or apparent authority to do, because they are not “in the ordinary course of \npartnership.” These actions are: (1) assignment of partnership property for the benefit of creditors, (2) \ndisposing of the firm’s goodwill (selling the right to do business with the firm’s clients to another \nbusiness), (3) actions that make it impossible to carry on the business, (4) confessing a judgment against \nthe partnership, and (5) submitting a partnership claim or liability. RUPA omits that section, leaving it to \nthe courts to decide the outer limits of the agency power of a partner. In any event, unauthorized actions \nby a partner may be ratified by the partnership. \n \nPartnership “Statements” \nNew under RUPA is the ability of partnerships, partners, or even nonpartners to issue and file \n“statements” that announce to the world the establishment or denial of authority. The goal here is to \ncontrol the reach of apparent authority. There are several kinds of statements authorized. \n \nA statement of partnership authority is allowed by RUPA Section 303. It specifies the names of the \npartners authorized, or not authorized, to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership and any \nother matters. The most important goal of the statement of authority is to facilitate the transfer of real \nproperty held in the name of the partnership. A statement must specify the names of the partners \nauthorized to execute an instrument transferring that property. \nA statement of denial, RUPA Section 304, operates to allow partners (and persons named as partners) \nan opportunity to deny any fact asserted in a statement of partnership authority. \n \nA statement of dissociation, RUPA Section 704, may be filed by a partnership or a dissociated partner, \ninforming the world that the person is no longer a partner. This tells the world that the named person is \nno longer in the partnership. \n \nThere are three other statements authorized: a statement of qualification establishes that the partnership \nhas satisfied all conditions precedent to the qualification of the partnership as a limited liability \npartnership; a statement of foreign qualification means a limited liability partnership is qualified and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n507 \nregistered to do business in a state other than that in which it is originally registered; and a statement of \namendment or cancellation of any of the foregoing.

[13] \n \nWhen partners come and go, as they do, problems may arise. What power does the dissociated partner \nhave to bind the partnership? What power does the partnership have to impose liability on the dissociated \none? RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or \nher apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would \nhave bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the \ndissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have \nconstructive notice from a filed “statement of dissociation.”[14] The dissociated partner, of course, is liable \nfor damages to the partnership if third parties had cause to think she was still a partner and the \npartnership became liable because of that; she is liable to the firm as an unauthorized agent.[15] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n518 \n \nA partner’s dissociation does nothing to change that partner’s liability for predissociation \nobligations. [16] For postdissociation liability, exposure is for two years if at the time of entering into the \ntransaction the other party (1) reasonably believed the dissociated one was a partner, (2) didn’t have \nnotice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have constructive notice from a filed “statement of \ndissociation.” For example, Baker withdraws from the firm of Able, Baker, and Carr. Able contracts with \nHydroLift for a new hydraulic car lift that costs $25,000 installed. HydroLift is not aware at the time of \ncontracting that Baker is disassociated and believes she is still a partner. A year later, the firm not having \nbeen paid, HydroLift sues Able, Baker, and Carr and the partnership. Baker has potential liability. Baker \ncould have protected herself by filing a “statement of dissociation,” or—better—the partnership agreement \nshould provide that the firm would file such statements upon the dissociation of any partner (and if it \ndoes not, it would be liable to her for the consequences). \n \nDissolution \nDissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution (see the discussion later in this section of how the firm \ncontinues after a dissociation); dissolution and winding up happen only for the causes stated in RUPA \nSection 801, discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nThere are three causes of dissolution: (1) by act of the partners—some dissociations do trigger dissolution; \n(2) by operation of law; or (3) by court order. The partnership agreement may change or eliminate the \ndissolution trigger as to (1); dissolution by the latter two means cannot be tinkered with.[17] \n \n(1) Dissolution by act of the partners may occur as follows: \n \n• \nAny member of an at-will partnership can dissociate at any time, triggering dissolution and \nliquidation. The partners who wish to continue the business of a term partnership, though, cannot \nbe forced to liquidate the business by a partner who withdraws prematurely in violation of the \npartnership agreement. In any event, common agreement formats for dissolution will provide for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n519 \nbuilt-in dispute resolution, and enlightened partners often agree to such mechanisms in advance to \navoid the kinds of problems listed here. \n• \nAny partnership will dissolve upon the happening of an event the partners specified would cause \ndissolution in their agreement. They may change their minds, of course, agree to continue, and amend \nthe partnership agreement accordingly. \n• \nA term partnership may be dissolved before its term expires in three ways. First, if a partner \ndissociated by death, declaring bankruptcy, becoming incapacitated, or wrongfully dissociates, the \npartnership will dissolve if within ninety days of that triggering dissociation at least half the \nremaining partners express their will to wind it up. Second, the partnership may be dissolved if the \nterm expires. Third, it may be dissolved if all the partners agree to amend the partnership agreement \nby expressly agreeing to dissolve. \n \n(2) Dissolution will happen in some cases by operation of law if it becomes illegal to continue the \nbusiness, or substantially all of it. For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable.

To that end, Southern Oaks and Horizon entered \ninto several partnership and management contracts in 1993. \n \nIn 1996, Southern Oaks filed suit alleging numerous defaults and breaches of the twenty-year \nagreements.…[T]he trial court found largely in favor of Southern Oaks, concluding that Horizon breached \nits obligations under two different partnership agreements [and that] Horizon had breached several \nmanagement contracts. Thereafter, the court ordered that the partnerships be dissolved, finding that “the \nparties to the various agreements which are the subject of this lawsuit are now incapable of continuing to \noperate in business together” and that because it was dissolving the partnerships, “there is no entitlement \nto future damages.…” In its cross appeal, Southern Oaks asserts that because Horizon unilaterally and \nwrongfully sought dissolution of the partnerships, Southern Oaks should receive a damage award for the \nloss of the partnerships’ seventeen remaining years’ worth of future profits. We reject its argument. \n \nSouthern Oaks argues Horizon wrongfully caused the dissolution because the basis for dissolution cited \nby the court is not one of the grounds for which the parties contracted. The pertinent contracts provided \nin section 7.3 “Causes of Dissolution”: “In addition to the causes for dissolution set forth in Section 7.2(c), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n539 \nthe Partnership shall be dissolved in the event that:…(d) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the \nother Partner, either Partner elects to dissolve the Partnership on account of an Irreconcilable Difference \nwhich arises and cannot, after good faith efforts, be resolved.…” \n \nSouthern Oaks argues that what Horizon relied on at trial as showing irreconcilable differences—the \ndecisions of how profits were to be determined and divided—were not “good faith differences of opinion,” \nnor did they have “a material and adverse impact on the conduct of the Partnerships’ Business.” Horizon’s \nrefusal to pay Southern Oaks according to the terms of the contracts was not an “irreconcilable difference” \nas defined by the contract, Southern Oaks asserts, pointing out that Horizon’s acts were held to be \nbreaches of the contracts. Because there was no contract basis for dissolution, Horizon’s assertion of \ndissolution was wrongful, Southern Oaks concludes. \n \nSouthern Oaks contends further that not only were there no contractual grounds for dissolution, \ndissolution was also wrongful under the Florida Statutes. Southern Oaks argues that pursuant to section \n[of that statute] Horizon had the power to dissociate from the partnership, but, in the absence of contract \ngrounds for the dissociation, Horizon wrongfully dissociated. It asserts that it is entitled to lost future \nprofits under Florida’s partnership law.… \n \nWe find Southern Oaks’ argument without merit. First, the trial court’s finding that the parties are \nincapable of continuing to operate in business together is a finding of “irreconcilable differences,” a \npermissible reason for dissolving the partnerships under the express terms of the partnership agreements. \nThus, dissolution was not “wrongful,” assuming there can be “wrongful” dissolutions, and Southern Oaks \nwas not entitled to damages for lost future profits. Additionally, the partnership contracts also permit \ndissolution by “judicial decree.” Although neither party cites this provision, it appears that pursuant \nthereto, the parties agreed that dissolution would be proper if done by a trial court for whatever reason \nthe court found sufficient to warrant dissolution. \n \nSecond, even assuming the partnership was dissolved for a reason not provided for in the partnership \nagreements, damages were properly denied. Under RUPA, it is clear that wrongful dissociation triggers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n540 \nliability for lost future profits. See [RUPA:] “A partner who wrongfully dissociates is liable to the \npartnership and to the other partners for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition \nto any other obligation of the partner to the partnership or to the other partners.” However, RUPA \ndoes not contain a similar provision for dissolution; RUPA does not refer to the dissolutions as rightful or \nwrongful. [RUPA sets out] “Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership business,” [and] \noutlines the events causing dissolution without any provision for liability for damages.…[RUPA] \nrecognizes judicial dissolution: \n \nA partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only upon the occurrence of any of \nthe following events:… \n \n(5) On application by a partner, a judicial determination that: \n(a) The economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; \n(b) Another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business which makes it \nnot reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with such partner; or",

Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability, partnerships \nthe inestimable benefit of limited taxation. Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their \ntaxation. \n \nAt base, whether to allow businesspeople and investors to grasp the holy grail of limited liability is a \npolitical issue. When we say a person is “irresponsible,” it means he (or she, or it) does not take \nresponsibility for his harmful actions; the loss is borne by others. Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment. So the political trade-off \nwith allowing various inventive forms of business organization is between providing business actors \nwith the security that they will lose only their calculable investment, thus stimulating the economy, \nversus the “moral hazard” of allowing them to emerge mostly unscathed from their own harmful or \nfoolish activities, thus externalizing resulting losses upon others. Some people feel that during the \nrun-up to the “Great Recession” of 2007–09, the economic system allowed too much risk taking. \nWhen the risky investments collapsed, though, instead of forcing the risk takers to suffer loss, the \ngovernment intervened—it “bailed them out,” as they say, putting the consequences of the failed \nrisks on the taxpayer. \n \nThe risk-averseness and inventiveness of businesspeople is seemingly unlimited, as is investors’ urge \nto make profits through others’ efforts with as little risk as possible. The rationale for the invention of \nthese hybrid business forms, then, is (1) risk reduction and (2) tax reduction. Here we take up the \nmost common hybrid types first: limited partnerships and limited liability companies. Then we cover \nthem in the approximate chronological order of their invention: sub-S corporations, limited liability \npartnerships, and limited liability limited partnerships. All these forms are entities. \n \n \n \n13.1 Limited Partnerships \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n548 \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nUnderstand the following aspects of the limited partnership: \n1. Governing law and definition \n2. Creation and capitalization \n3. Control and compensation \n4. Liabilities \n5. Taxation \n6. Termination \n \n \nGoverning Law and Definition \nThe limited partnership is attractive because of its treatment of taxation and its imposition of limited \nliability on its limited partners. \nGoverning Law \nThe original source of limited partnership law is the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), which was \ndrafted in 1916. A revised version, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), was adopted \nby the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1976 and further amended in 1985 and \nin 2001. \n \nThe 2001 act was \ndrafted for a world in which limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies can \nmeet many of the needs formerly met by limited partnerships. This Act therefore targets two \ntypes of enterprises that seem largely beyond the scope of LLPs and LLCs: (i) sophisticated, \nmanager-entrenched commercial deals whose participants commit for the long term, and (ii) \nestate planning arrangements (family limited partnerships). The Act accordingly assumes that, \nmore often than not, people utilizing it will want (1) strong centralized management, strongly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n549 \nentrenched, and (2) passive investors with little control over or right to exit the entity. The Act’s \nrules, and particularly its default rules, have been designed to reflect these assumptions. [1] \n \nAll states except Louisiana adopted the 1976 or 1985 act—most opting for the 1985 version—and sixteen \nstates have adopted the 2001 version. The acts may be properly referred to with a hyphen: “ULPA-1985,” \nor “ULPA-2001”; the word revised has been dropped. Here, we mainly discuss ULPA-1985. The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) also applies to limited \npartnerships except where it is inconsistent with the limited partnership statutes. The ULPA-2001 is not \nso much related to UPA or RUPA as previous versions were. \n \nDefinition \nA limited partnership (LP) is defined as “a partnership formed by two or more persons under the laws \nof a State and having one or more general partners and one or more limited partners.” [2] The form tends \nto be attractive in business situations that focus on a single or limited-term project, such as making a \nmovie or developing real estate; it is also widely used by private equity firms. \n \nCreation and Capitalization \nUnlike a general partnership, a limited partnership is created in accordance with the state statute \nauthorizing it. There are two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited partners capitalize \nthe business and the general partners run it. \n \nCreation",

Union Properties, Inc. \n562 P.2d 244 (Wash. 1977) \n \nPlaintiff [Frigidaire] entered into a contract with Commercial Investors (Commercial), a limited \npartnership. Defendants, Leonard Mannon and Raleigh Baxter, were limited partners of Commercial. \nDefendants were also officers, directors, and shareholders of Union Properties, Inc., the only general \npartner of Commercial. Defendants controlled Union Properties, and through their control of Union \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n570 \nProperties they exercised the day-to-day control and management of Commercial. Commercial breached \nthe contract, and Plaintiff brought suit against Union Properties and Defendants. The trial court \nconcluded that Defendants did not incur general liability for Commercial’s obligations by reason of their \ncontrol of Commercial, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. \n \n[Plaintiff] does not contend that Defendants acted improperly by setting up the limited partnership with a \ncorporation as the sole general partner. Limited partnerships are a statutory form of business \norganization, and parties creating a limited partnership must follow the statutory requirements. In \nWashington, parties may form a limited partnership with a corporation as the sole general partner. \n[Citations] \n \nPlaintiff’s sole contention is that Defendants should incur general liability for the limited partnership’s \nobligations under RCW 25.08.070, because they exercised the day-to-day control and management of \nCommercial. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Commercial was controlled by Union Properties, a \nseparate legal entity, and not by Defendants in their individual capacities. [RCW 25.08.070 then read: “A \nlimited partner shall not become liable as a general partner unless, in addition to the exercise of his rights \nand powers as limited partner, he takes part in the control of the business.”] \n \n…The pattern of operation of Union Properties was to investigate and conceive of real estate investment \nopportunities and, when it found such opportunities, to cause the creation of limited partnerships with \nUnion Properties acting as the general partner. Commercial was only one of several limited partnerships \nso conceived and created. Defendants did not form Union Properties for the sole purpose of operating \nCommercial. Hence, their acts on behalf of Union Properties were not performed merely for the benefit of \nCommercial.… \n \n[P]etitioner was never led to believe that Defendants were acting in any capacity other than in their \ncorporate capacities. The parties stipulated at the trial that Defendants never acted in any direct, personal \ncapacity. When the shareholders of a corporation, who are also the corporation’s officers and directors, \nconscientiously keep the affairs of the corporation separate from their personal affairs, and no fraud or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n571 \nmanifest injustice is perpetrated upon third persons who deal with the corporation, the corporation’s \nseparate entity should be respected. [Citations] \n \nFor us to find that Defendants incurred general liability for the limited partnership’s obligations under \nRCW 25.08.070 would require us to apply a literal interpretation of the statute and totally ignore the \ncorporate entity of Union Properties, when Plaintiff knew it was dealing with that corporate entity. There \ncan be no doubt that Defendants, in fact, controlled the corporation. However, they did so only in their \ncapacities as agents for their principal, the corporate general partner. Although the corporation was a \nseparate entity, it could act only through its board of directors, officers, and agents. [Citations] Plaintiff \nentered into the contract with Commercial. Defendants signed the contract in their capacities as president \nand secretary-treasurer of Union Properties, the general partner of Commercial. In the eyes of the law it \nwas Union Properties, as a separate corporate entity, which entered into the contract with Plaintiff and \ncontrolled the limited partnership. \nFurther, because Defendants scrupulously separated their actions on behalf of the corporation from their \npersonal actions, Plaintiff never mistakenly assumed that Defendants were general partners with general \nliability.

            "chunk": "corporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total",

The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware. In addition, Delaware’s Court of Chancery, \na court of equity, is renowned as a premier business court with a well-established body of corporate law, \nthereby affording a business a certain degree of predictability in judicial decision making. \n \nThe Promoter \nFunctions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n604 \nOnce the state of incorporation has been selected, it is time for promoters, the midwives of the \nenterprise, to go to work.

They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated.

Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed. If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable. \n \nNow assume that the corporation is formed on October 15, and on October 18 it formally accepts all the \ncontracts that Bob signed prior to October 15. Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance. Under RMBCA, Section 6.20, however, a \nsubscription for shares is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement itself provides \notherwise or unless all the subscribers consent to revocation. In many states that have not adopted the \nmodel act, the contract rule applies and the offer is always revocable. Other states use various common-\nlaw devices to prevent revocation. For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles of incorporation typically include the \nfollowing: the corporate name; the address of the corporation’s initial registered office; the period of the \ncorporation’s duration (usually perpetual); the company’s purposes; the total number of shares, the \nclasses into which they are divided, and the par value of each; the limitations and rights of each class of \nshareholders; the authority of the directors to establish preferred or special classes of stock; provisions for \npreemptive rights; provisions for the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation, including any \nprovision restricting the transfer of shares; the number of directors constituting the initial board of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n606 \ndirectors and the names and addresses of initial members; and the name and address of each \nincorporator.

Although compliance with these requirements is largely a matter of filling in the blanks, two \npoints deserve mention. \n \nFirst, the choice of a name is often critical to the business. Under RMBCA, Section 4.01, the name must \ninclude one of the following words (or abbreviations): corporation, company, incorporated, or limited \n(Corp., Co., Inc., or Ltd.). The name is not allowed to deceive the public about the corporation’s purposes, \nnor may it be the same as that of any other company incorporated or authorized to do business in the \nstate. \n \nThese legal requirements are obvious; the business requirements are much harder. If the name is not \ndescriptive of the business or does not anticipate changes in the business, it may have to be changed, and \nthe change can be expensive. For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes.

Once completed, the articles of incorporation are delivered to the secretary of state for \nfiling. The existence of a corporation begins once the articles have been filed. \n \nOrganizational Meeting of Directors \nThe first order of business, once the certificate of incorporation is issued, is a meeting of the board of \ndirectors named in the articles of incorporation. They must adopt bylaws, elect officers, and transact any \nother business that may come before the meeting (RMBCA, Section 2.05). Other business would include \naccepting (ratifying) promoters’ contracts, calling for the payment of stock subscriptions, and adopting \nbank resolution forms, giving authority to various officers to sign checks drawn on the corporation. \nSection 10.20 of the RMBCA vests in the directors the power to alter, amend, or repeal the bylaws adopted \nat the initial meeting, subject to repeal or change by the shareholders. The articles of incorporation may \nreserve the power to modify or repeal exclusively to the shareholders. The bylaws may contain any \nprovisions that do not conflict with the articles of incorporation or the law of the state. \n \nTypical provisions in the bylaws include fixing the place and time at which annual stockholders’ meetings \nwill be held, fixing a quorum, setting the method of voting, establishing the method of choosing directors, \ncreating committees of directors, setting down the method by which board meetings may be called and \nthe voting procedures to be followed, determining the offices to be filled by the directors and the powers \nwith which each officer shall be vested, fixing the method of declaring dividends, establishing a fiscal year, \nsetting out rules governing issuance and transfer of stock, and establishing the method of amending the \nbylaws. \n \nSection 2.07 of the RMBCA provides that the directors may adopt bylaws that will operate during an \nemergency. An emergency is a situation in which “a quorum of the corporation’s directors cannot readily \nbe assembled because of some catastrophic event.” \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n608",

Graziano \n355 A.2d. 830 (1976) \n \nEAGEN, JUSTICE. \n \nOn April 30, 1970, RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. [RKO], as seller, entered into an agreement of sale \nwith Jack Jenofsky and Ralph Graziano, as purchasers. This agreement contemplated the sale of the Kent \nTheatre, a parcel of improved commercial real estate located at Cumberland and Kensington Avenues in \nPhiladelphia, for a total purchase price of $70,000. Settlement was originally scheduled for September \n30, 1970, and, at the request of Jenofsky and Graziano, continued twice, first to October 16, 1970, and \nthen to October 21, 1970. However, Jenofsky and Graziano failed to complete settlement on the last \nscheduled date. \n \nSubsequently, on November 13, 1970, RKO filed a complaint in equity seeking judicial enforcement of the \nagreement of sale. Although Jenofsky, in his answer to the complaint, denied personal liability for the \nperformance of the agreement, the chancellor, after a hearing, entered a decree nisi granting the \nrequested relief sought by RKO.…This appeal ensued. \nAt the time of the execution of this agreement, Jenofsky and Graziano were engaged in promoting the \nformation of a corporation to be known as Kent Enterprises, Inc. Reflecting these efforts, Paragraph 19 of \nthe agreement, added by counsel for Jenofsky and Graziano, recited: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n619 \nIt is understood by the parties hereto that it is the intention of the Purchaser to incorporate. Upon \ncondition that such incorporation be completed by closing, all agreements, covenants, and warranties \ncontained herein shall be construed to have been made between Seller and the resultant corporation and \nall documents shall reflect same. \n \nIn fact, Jenofsky and Graziano did file Articles of Incorporation for Kent Enterprises, Inc., with the State \nCorporation Bureau on October 9, 1971, twelve days prior to the scheduled settlement date. Jenofsky now \ncontends the inclusion of Paragraph 19 in the agreement and the subsequent filing of incorporation \npapers, released him from any personal liability resulting from the non-performance of the agreement. \n \nThe legal relationship of Jenofsky to Kent Enterprises, Inc., at the date of the execution of the agreement \nof sale was that of promoter. As such, he is subject to the general rule that a promoter, although he may \nassume to act on behalf of a projected corporation and not for himself, will be held personally liable on \ncontracts made by him for the benefit of a corporation he intends to organize. This personal liability will \ncontinue even after the contemplated corporation is formed and has received the benefits of the contract, \nunless there is a novation or other agreement to release liability. \n \nThe imposition of personal liability upon a promoter where that promoter has contracted on behalf of a \ncorporation is based upon the principle that one who assumes to act for a nonexistent principal is himself \nliable on the contract in the absence of an agreement to the contrary. \n \n[T]here [are] three possible understandings that parties may have when an agreement is executed by a \npromoter on behalf of a proposed corporation: \nWhen a party is acting for a proposed corporation, he cannot, of course, bind it by anything he does, at the \ntime, but he may (1) take on its behalf an offer from the other which, being accepted after the formation of \nthe company, becomes a contract; (2) make a contract at the time binding himself, with the stipulation or \nunderstanding, that if a company is formed it will take his place and that then he shall be relieved of \nresponsibility; or (3) bind himself personally without more and look to the proposed company, when \nformed, for indemnity. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n620 \n \nBoth RKO and Jenofsky concede the applicability of alternative No. 2 to the instant case. That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed,",

Holders of common stock have a different set of rights, namely, the right to vote on \nimportant corporate decisions such as the election of directors. A corporation may purchase some of its \nshares from its shareholders in a process called a buyback. Stock in the hands of the corporation is called \ntreasury stock.

Understand what an initial public offering is and under what circumstances one is usually done. \n2. Examine the various requirements of selling stock. \n3. Discuss what adequate and valid consideration is in exchange for stock. \n \n \nSale of stock \nRather than using debt to finance operations, a corporation may instead sell stock. This is most often \naccomplished through an initial public offering (IPO), or the first time a corporation offers stock for \nsale to the public. The sale of securities, such as stock, is governed by the Securities Act of 1933. In \nparticular, Section 5 of the 1933 act governs the specifics of the sale of securities. To return to BCT \nBookstore, Inc., suppose the company wishes to sell stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for \nthe first time. That would be an IPO. The company would partner with securities lawyers and investment \nbanks to accomplish the sale. The banks underwrite the sale of the securities: in exchange for a fee, the \nbank will buy the shares from BCT and then sell them. The company and its team prepare a registration \nstatement, which contains required information about the IPO and is submitted to the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC). The SEC reviews the registration statement and makes the decision \nwhether to permit or prohibit BCT’s IPO. Once the SEC approves the IPO, BCT’s investment banks \npurchase the shares in the primary market and then resell them to investors on the secondary market on \nthe NYSE. (For a further discussion of these two markets, see Chapter 17 \"Securities Regulation\"). Stock \nsales are not limited to an IPO—publicly traded corporations may sell stock several times after going \npublic. The requirements of the 1933 act remain but are loosened for well-known corporations (well-\nknown seasoned issuers). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n644 \nAn IPO or stock sale has several advantages. A corporation may have too much debt and would prefer to \nraise funds through a sale of stock rather than increasing its debt. The total costs of selling stock are often \nlower than financing through debt: the IPO may be expensive, but debt costs can vastly exceed the IPO \ncost because of the interest payments on the debt. Also, IPOs are a popular method of increasing a firm’s \nexposure, bringing the corporation many more investors and increasing its public image.

Issuing stock is \nalso beneficial for the corporation because the corporation can use shares as compensation; for example, \nemployment compensation may be in the form of stock, such as in an employee stock ownership plan. \nInvestors also seek common stock, whether in an IPO or in the secondary market. While common stock is \na riskier investment than a bond, stock ownership can have tremendous upside—after all, the sky is the \nlimit on the price of a stock. On the other hand, there is the downside: the price of the stock can plummet, \ncausing the shareholder significant monetary loss. \n \nCertainly, an IPO has some disadvantages. Ownership is diluted: BCT had very few owners before its IPO \nbut may have millions of owners after the IPO. As mentioned, an IPO can be expensive. An IPO can also \nbe undervalued: the corporation and its investment banks may undervalue the IPO stock price, causing \nthe corporation to lose out on the difference between its determined price and the market price. Being a \npublic corporation also places the corporation under the purview of the SEC and requires ongoing \ndisclosures. Timing can be problematic: the registration review process can take several weeks. The stock \nmarkets can change drastically over that waiting period. Furthermore, the offering could have insufficient \npurchasers to raise sufficient funds; that is, the public might not have enough interest in purchasing the \ncompany’s stock to bring in sufficient funds to the corporation. Finally, a firm that goes public releases \ninformation that is available to the public, which could be useful to competitors (trade secrets, \ninnovations, new technology, etc.). \n \nAs mentioned, one of the main disadvantages of going public is the SEC review and disclosure \nrequirements. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs most secondary market transactions. The \n1934 act places certain requirements on corporations that have sold securities. Both the 1933 and 1934 \nacts require corporations to disseminate information to the public and/or its investors. These \nrequirements were strengthened after the collapse of Enron in 2001. The SEC realized that its disclosure \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n645 \nrequirements were not strong enough, as demonstrated by the accounting tricks and downfall of Enron \nand its accountant, Arthur Andersen. [1] \n \nAs a result of Enron’s accounting scandal, as well as problems with other corporations, Congress \ntightened the noose by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. [2] This act increased the disclosure of \nfinancial information, increased transparency, and required the dissemination of information about what \na corporation was doing. For example, Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that a corporation’s chief \nexecutive officer and chief financial officer certify annual and quarterly reports and state that the report \ndoes not contain any material falsehoods and that the financial data accurately reflect the corporation’s \ncondition. \n \nNature of the Consideration \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. While cash is commonly used to purchase \nstock, a stock purchaser may pay with something other than cash, such as property, whether tangible or \nintangible, or services or labor performed for the corporation. In most states, promissory notes and \ncontracts for future services are not lawful forms of consideration. The case United Steel Industries, Inc. \nv. Manhart, (see Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), illustrates the problems that can \narise when services or promises of future delivery are intended as payment for stock. \n \n \nEvaluating the Consideration: Watered Stock \nIn United Steel Industries (Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), assume that Griffitts’s \nlegal services had been thought by the corporation to be worth $6,000 but in fact were worth $1,000, and \nthat he had received stock with par value of $6,000 (i.e., 6,000 shares of $1 par value stock) in exchange \nfor his services. Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value? This is the problem of watered stock: the inflated consideration is in fact less \nthan par value. The term itself comes from the ancient fraud of farmers and ranchers who increased the \nweight of their cattle (also known as stock) by forcing them to ingest excess water. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n646",

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends \nThe law imposes certain limitations on cash or property dividends a corporation may disburse. Dividends \nmay not be paid if (1) the business is insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they become due), (2) \npaying dividends would make it insolvent, or (3) payment would violate a restriction in the articles of \nincorporation. Most states also restrict the funds available for distribution to those available in earned \nsurplus. Under this rule, a corporation that ran a deficit in the current year could still declare a dividend \nas long as the total earned surplus offset the deficit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n650 \nA few states—significantly, Delaware is one of them—permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current \nearnings and those of the immediately preceding year, both years taken as a single period, even if the \nbalance sheet shows a negative earned surplus. Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified",

Know the modern changes to corporate finance terminology and specific requirements imposed by states. \n2. Compare the application of the Uniform Commercial Code to corporate finance with the applicability of the \n1933 and 1934 federal securities acts. \n \n \nChanges in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n653 \nPerhaps the most dramatic innovations incorporated into the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \n(RMBCA) are the financial provisions. The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation. [1] \n \nTherefore, although the modern trend is to move away from par value as well as some other previously \ndiscussed terms—and despite the RMBCA’s abandonment of these concepts—they still, in large measure, \npersist. \n \nIntroduction to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n654 \nPartial ownership of a corporation would be an awkward investment if there were no ready means of \ntransfer. The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the",

They may apply profits in payment of \nfloating or funded debts, or in development of the company’s business; and so long as they do not \nabuse their discretionary powers, or violate the company’s charter, the courts cannot interfere. \n \nBut it is clear that the agents of a corporation, and even the majority, cannot arbitrarily withhold \nprofits earned by the company, or apply them to any use which is not authorized by the \ncompany’s charter.… \n \nMr. Henry Ford is the dominant force in the business of the Ford Motor Company. No plan of operations \ncould be adopted unless he consented, and no board of directors can be elected whom he does not favor. \nOne of the directors of the company has no stock. One share was assigned to him to qualify him for the \nposition, but it is not claimed that he owns it. A business, one of the largest in the world, and one of the \nmost profitable, has been built up. It employs many men, at good pay. \n \n“My ambition,” said Mr. Ford, “is to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this \nindustrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their \nhomes. To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business.” \n \n“With regard to dividends, the company paid sixty per cent on its capitalization of two million \ndollars, or $1,200,000, leaving $58,000,000 to reinvest for the growth of the company. This is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n660 \nMr. Ford’s policy at present, and it is understood that the other stockholders cheerfully accede to \nthis plan.” \n \nHe had made up his mind in the summer of 1916 that no dividends other than the regular dividends \nshould be paid, “for the present.” \n \n“Q. For how long? Had you fixed in your mind any time in the future, when you were going to \npay— \n“A. No. \n“Q. That was indefinite in the future? \n“A. That was indefinite, yes, sir.” \n \nThe record, and especially the testimony of Mr. Ford, convinces that he has to some extent the attitude \ntowards shareholders of one who has dispensed and distributed to them large gains and that they should \nbe content to take what he chooses to give. His testimony creates the impression, also, that he thinks the \nFord Motor Company has made too much money, has had too large profits, and that although large profits \nmight be still earned, a sharing of them with the public, by reducing the price of the output of the \ncompany, ought to be undertaken. We have no doubt that certain sentiments, philanthropic and altruistic, \ncreditable to Mr. Ford, had large influence in determining the policy to be pursued by the Ford Motor \nCompany—the policy which has been herein referred to. \n \n* * * \n \nThe difference between an incidental humanitarian expenditure of corporate funds for the benefit of the \nemployees, like the building of a hospital for their use and the employment of agencies for the betterment \nof their condition, and a general purpose and plan to benefit mankind at the expense of others, is obvious. \nThere should be no confusion (of which there is evidence) of the duties which Mr. Ford conceives that he \nand the stockholders owe to the general public and the duties which in law he and his codirectors owe to \nprotesting, minority stockholders. A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n661 \nprofit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end. The discretion of \ndirectors is to be exercised in the choice of means to attain that end and does not extend to a change in the \nend itself, to the reduction of profits or to the nondistribution of profits among stockholders in order to \ndevote them to other purposes. \n \n* * * \n \nWe are not, however, persuaded that we should interfere with the proposed expansion of the business of \nthe Ford Motor Company. In view of the fact that the selling price of products may be increased at any \ntime, the ultimate results of the larger business cannot be certainly estimated. The judges are not business \nexperts. It is recognized that plans must often be made for a long future, for expected competition, for a \ncontinuing as well as an immediately profitable venture.

Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3. The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670 \nSuppose an incorporated luncheon club refuses to admit women as club members or guests. What \nhappens if this action is ultra vires? Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. (see Section 16.5.1 \"Ultra Vires \nActs\"), focuses on this issue. An ultra vires act is not necessarily criminal or tortious. However, every \ncrime and tort is in some sense ultra vires because a corporation never has legal authority to commit \ncrimes or torts. They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent. An additional dilemma was that society could not \nliterally imprison a corporation. Modern law is not so constricting. Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions. But these \ncases are extremely rare. \n \nThat a corporation is found guilty of a violation of the law does not excuse company officials who \nauthorized or carried out the illegal act. They, too, can be prosecuted and sent to jail. Legal punishments \nare being routinely added to the newer regulatory statutes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and the Toxic Substances Control Act—although prosecution depends mainly on whether and where a \nparticular administration wishes to spend its enforcement dollars. Additionally, state prosecuting \nattorneys have become more active in filing criminal charges against management when employees are \ninjured or die on the job. For instance, a trial court judge in Chicago sentenced a company president, \nplant manager, and foreman to twenty-five years in prison after they were convicted of murder following \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n671 \nthe death of a worker as a result of unsafe working conditions at a plant; [3] the punishments were later \noverturned, but the three pled guilty several years later and served shorter sentences of varying duration. \n \nMore recently, prosecutors have been expanding their prosecutions of corporations and developing \nmethodologies to evaluate whether a corporation has committed a criminal act; for example, US Deputy \nAttorney General Paul McNulty revised “Principles of Federal Prosecutions of Business Organizations” in \n2006 to further guide prosecutors in indicting corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\"). [4] This stands in contrast to the general rule that an individual must \nknow, or should know, of a violation of the law in order to be liable. Strict liability does not require",

The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to \nwhich we now turn. For further discussions of the business judgment rule, see Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, \nInc., [8] In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, [9] and Smith v. Van Gorkom. [10] \n \nIf a shareholder is not pleased by a director’s decision, that shareholder may file a derivative suit. The \nderivative suit may be filed by a shareholder on behalf of the corporation against directors or officers of \nthe corporation, alleging breach of their fiduciary obligations. However, a shareholder, as a prerequisite to \nfiling a derivative action, must first demand that the board of directors take action, as the actual party in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n690 \ninterest is the corporation, not the shareholder (meaning that if the shareholder is victorious in the \nlawsuit, it is actually the corporation that “wins”). If the board refuses, is its decision protected by the \nbusiness judgment rule? The general rule is that the board may refuse to file a derivative suit and will be \nprotected by the business judgment rule. And even when a derivative suit is filed, directors can be \nprotected by the business judgment rule for decisions even the judge considers to have been poorly made. \nSee In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, (see Section 16.5.2 \"Business Judgment Rule\"). \n \nIn a battle for control of a corporation, directors (especially “inside” directors, who are employees of the \ncorporation, such as officers) often have an inherent self-interest in preserving their positions, which can \nlead them to block mergers that the shareholders desire and that may be in the firm’s best interest. As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum, [11] for instance, the court held that directors who adopt a defensive \nmechanism “must show that they had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy \nand effectiveness existed.…[T]hey satisfy that burden ‘by showing good faith and reasonable \ninvestigation.’” The business judgment rule clearly does not protect every decision of the board. \nThe Unocal court developed a test for the board: the directors may only work to prevent a takeover when \nthey can demonstrate a threat to the policies of the corporation and that any defensive measures taken to \nprevent the takeover were reasonable and proportional given the depth of the threat. The Unocal test was \nmodified further by requiring a finding, before a court steps in, that the actions of a board were coercive, a \nstep back toward the business judgment rule. [12] \n \nIn a widely publicized case, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of Time, Inc. met \nthe Unocal test—that the board reasonably concluded that a tender offer by Paramount constituted a \nthreat and acted reasonably in rejecting Paramount’s offer and in merging with Warner \nCommunications. [13] \n \nThe specific elements of the fiduciary duties are not spelled out in stone. For example, the Delaware \ncourts have laid out three factors to examine when determining whether a duty of care has been \nbreached: [14] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n691 \n \n1. The directors knew, or should have known, that legal breaches were occurring. \n2. The directors took no steps to prevent or resolve the situation. \n3. This failure caused the losses about which the shareholder is complaining in a derivative suit. \n \nThus the court expanded the duty of oversight (which is included under the umbrella of the duty of care; \nthese duties are often referred to as the Caremark duties). Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation.

So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies. Second, they make it more difficult for \nshareholders to monitor the performance of a company’s board; measuring decisions against the single \ngoal of profit maximization is far easier than against the subjective goal of “balancing” a host of competing \ninterests. Constituency statutes run contrary to the concept of shareholders as owners, and of the \nfiduciary duties owed to them, effectively softening shareholder power. Nevertheless, since many states \nnow have constituency statutes, it is only reasonable to expect that the traditional doctrine holding \nshareholder interests paramount will begin to give way, even as the shareholders challenge new decisions \nby directors that favor communities, employees, and others with an important stake in the welfare of the \ncorporations with which they deal. For a more complete discussion of constituency statutes, see \n“Corporate Governance and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act: Corporate Constituency Statutes and Employee \nGovernance.” [17] \n \nMany modern corporations have begun to promote socially responsible behavior. While dumping toxic \nwaste out the back door of the manufacturing facility rather than expending funds to properly dispose of \nthe waste may result in an increase in value, the consequences of dumping the waste can be quite severe, \nwhether from fines from regulatory authorities or from public backlash. Corporate social responsibility \nresults from internal corporate policies that attempt to self-regulate and fulfill legal, ethical, and social \nobligations. Thus under corporate social responsibility, corporations may make donations to charitable \norganizations or build environmentally friendly or energy-efficient buildings. Socially irresponsible \nbehavior can be quite disastrous for a corporation. Nike, for example, was hit by consumer backlash due \nto its use of child labor in other countries, such as India and Malaysia. British Petroleum (BP) faced public \nanger as well as fines and lawsuits for a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This spill had serious \nconsequences for BP’s shareholders—BP stopped paying dividends, its stock price plummeted, and it had \nto set aside significant amounts of money to compensate injured individuals and businesses. \nMany businesses try to fulfill what is commonly called the triple bottom line, which is a focus on profits, \npeople, and the planet. For example, Ben and Jerry’s, the ice cream manufacturer, had followed a triple \nbottom line practice for many years. Nonetheless, when Ben and Jerry’s found itself the desired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n694 \nacquisition of several other businesses, it feared that a takeover of the firm would remove this focus, since \nfor some firms, there is only one bottom line—profits. Unilever offered $43.60 per share for Ben and \nJerry’s. Several Ben and Jerry’s insiders made a counteroffer at $38 per share, arguing that a lower price \nwas justified given the firm’s focus. Ultimately, in a case like this, the Revlon duties come into play: when \na corporation is for sale, corporate social responsibility goes out the window and only one bottom line \nexists—maximum shareholder value. In the case of Ben and Jerry’s, the company was acquired in 2000 \nfor $326 million by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch corporation that is the world’s largest consumer products \ncompany. \n \nSarbanes-Oxley and Other Modern Trends \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted following several accounting scandals, strengthens the duties \nowed by the board and other corporate officers. In particular, Title III contains corporate responsibility \nprovisions, such as requiring senior executives to vouch for the accuracy and completeness of their \ncorporation’s financial disclosures. While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith.

Other duties \nmay arise, such as when directors attempt to retain their positions on the board in the face of a hostile \ntender offer. Trends in fiduciary responsibilities, as well as other changes in the business legal field, are \ncovered extensively by the American Bar Association \nat http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html. \n \nLiability Prevention and Insurance \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n695 \nAlice, the director of BCT, has been charged with breaching her duty of care. Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law. Delaware Code Section 102(b)(7), as mentioned previously, was \nenacted after Smith v. Van Gorkom (discussed in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\") and was prompted by an",

Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club. The plaintiff sought to bring a female \nto lunch with him, and both he and his guest were refused seating at the luncheon facility. The plaintiff \nwrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either \nletter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected. Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate \npollings of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative \nproposals for amending the bylaws of corporation concerning the admission of women members and \nguests. None of these proposed amendments to the bylaws received the required number of votes for \nadoption. Following that balloting, the plaintiff again wrote to the president of the corporation and asked \nthat the directors stop interfering with his rights as a member to bring women guests to the luncheon \nfacility and to propose women for membership. The president’s reply was that “the existing bylaws, house \nrules and customs continue in effect, and therefore [the board] consider[s] the matter closed.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n699 \n \n* * * \n \nIn addition to seeking a declaratory judgment which will inform him of his rights vis-à-vis the corporation \nand its directors, the plaintiff is also seeking injunctive relief, orders directing the admission of the \nplaintiff’s candidate to membership and denying indemnity to the directors, money damages, and costs \nand expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees. It should be noted at the outset that the plaintiff is not \nmaking a claim under either the federal or state civil rights or equal accommodations statutes, but that he \nis solely asserting his membership rights under the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, and the \nstatutes governing the regulation of this nonstock corporation. As such, this is a case of first impression in \nConnecticut. \n \n* * * \nConnecticut has codified the common-law right of a member to proceed against his corporation or its \ndirectors in the event of an ultra vires act. In fact, it has been done specifically under the Nonstock \nCorporation Act. \n \nNo powers were given to the defendant corporation in its certificate of incorporation, only a purpose, and \nas a result the only incidental powers which the defendant would have under the common law are those \nwhich are necessary to effect its purpose, that being to serve lunch to its members. Since the club was not \nformed for the purpose of having an exclusively male luncheon club, it cannot be considered necessary to \nits stated purpose for the club to have the implied power at common law to exclude women members. \n \nUnder the Connecticut Nonstock Corporation Act, the corporation could have set forth in its certificate of \nincorporation that its purpose was to engage in any lawful activity permitted that corporation. That was \nnot done. Its corporate purposes were very narrowly stated to be solely for providing “facilities for the \nserving of luncheon or other meals to members.” The certificate did not restrict the purpose to the serving \nof male members. Section 33-428 of the General Statutes provides that the corporate powers of a \nnonstock corporation are those set forth in the Nonstock Corporation Act, those specifically stated in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n700 \ncertificate of incorporation, neither of which includes the power to exclude women members, and the \nimplied power to “exercise all legal powers necessary or convenient to effect any or all of the purposes \nstated in its certificate of incorporation.…” \n \nWe come, thus, to the nub of this controversy and the basic legal question raised by the facts in this case: \nIs it necessary or convenient to the purpose for which this corporation was organized for it to exclude \nwomen members? This court concludes that it is not. While a corporation might be organized for the \nnarrower purpose of providing a luncheon club for men only, this one was not so organized. Its stated",

The plaintiff appealed.] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n702 \nWe next turn to the claims of error that relate to the Disney defendants. Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination. We address separately those two categories and the issues that \nthey generate.… \n \n…[The due care] argument is best understood against the backdrop of the presumptions that cloak \ndirector action being reviewed under the business judgment standard. Our law presumes that “in making \na business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the \nhonest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Those presumptions can be \nrebutted if the plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted \nin bad faith. If that is shown, the burden then shifts to the director defendants to demonstrate that the \nchallenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders.… \n \nThe appellants’ first claim is that the Chancellor erroneously (i) failed to make a “threshold \ndetermination” of gross negligence, and (ii) “conflated” the appellants’ burden to rebut the business \njudgment presumptions, with an analysis of whether the directors’ conduct fell within the 8 Del. C. § \n102(b)(7) provision that precludes exculpation of directors from monetary liability “for acts or omissions \nnot in good faith.” The argument runs as follows: Emerald Partners v. Berlin required the Chancellor first \nto determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted based upon a showing that \nthe board violated its duty of care, i.e., acted with gross negligence. If gross negligence were established, \nthe burden would shift to the directors to establish that the OEA was entirely fair. Only if the directors \nfailed to meet that burden could the trial court then address the directors’ Section 102(b)(7) exculpation \ndefense, including the statutory exception for acts not in good faith. \n \nThis argument lacks merit. To make the argument the appellants must ignore the distinction between (i) a \ndetermination of bad faith for the threshold purpose of rebutting the business judgment rule \npresumptions, and (ii) a bad faith determination for purposes of evaluating the availability of charter-\nauthorized exculpation from monetary damage liability after liability has been established. Our law clearly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n703 \npermits a judicial assessment of director good faith for that former purpose. Nothing in Emerald \nPartners requires the Court of Chancery to consider only evidence of lack of due care (i.e. gross \nnegligence) in determining whether the business judgment rule presumptions have been rebutted.… \n \nThe appellants argue that the Disney directors breached their duty of care by failing to inform themselves \nof all material information reasonably available with respect to Ovitz’s employment agreement.…[but the] \nonly properly reviewable action of the entire board was its decision to elect Ovitz as Disney’s President. In \nthat context the sole issue, as the Chancellor properly held, is “whether [the remaining members of the old \nboard] properly exercised their business judgment and acted in accordance with their fiduciary duties \nwhen they elected Ovitz to the Company’s presidency.” The Chancellor determined that in electing Ovitz, \nthe directors were informed of all information reasonably available and, thus, were not grossly negligent. \nWe agree. \n \n…[The court turns to good faith.] The Court of Chancery held that the business judgment rule \npresumptions protected the decisions of the compensation committee and the remaining Disney \ndirectors, not only because they had acted with due care but also because they had not acted in bad faith. \nThat latter ruling, the appellants claim, was reversible error because the Chancellor formulated and then \napplied an incorrect definition of bad faith. \n \n…Their argument runs as follows: under the Chancellor’s 2003 definition of bad faith, the directors must \nhave “consciously and intentionally disregarded their responsibilities, adopting a ‘we don’t care about \nthe risks’ attitude concerning a material corporate decision.” Under the 2003 formulation, appellants say, \n“directors violate their duty of good faith if they are making material decisions without adequate \ninformation and without adequate deliberation[,]” but under the 2005 post-trial definition, bad faith \nrequires proof of a subjective bad motive or intent. This definitional change, it is claimed, was \nprocedurally prejudicial because appellants relied on the 2003 definition in presenting their evidence of \nbad faith at the trial.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

They argue that the 2003 formulation was (and is) the correct definition, because it is \n“logically tied to board decision-making under the duty of care.” The post-trial formulation, on the other \nhand, “wrongly incorporated substantive elements regarding the rationality of the decisions under review \nrather than being constrained, as in a due care analysis, to strictly procedural criteria.” We conclude that \nboth arguments must fail. \n \nThe appellants’ first argument—that there is a real, significant difference between the Chancellor’s pre-\ntrial and post-trial definitions of bad faith—is plainly wrong. We perceive no substantive difference \nbetween the Court of Chancery’s 2003 definition of bad faith—a “conscious and intentional disregard [of] \nresponsibilities, adopting a we don’t care about the risks’ attitude…”—and its 2005 post-trial definition—\nan “intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities.” Both formulations \nexpress the same concept, although in slightly different language. \n \nThe most telling evidence that there is no substantive difference between the two formulations is that the \nappellants are forced to contrive a difference. Appellants assert that under the 2003 formulation, \n“directors violate their duty of good faith if they are making material decisions without adequate \ninformation and without adequate deliberation.” For that ipse dixit they cite no legal authority. That \ncomes as no surprise because their verbal effort to collapse the duty to act in good faith into the duty to act \nwith due care, is not unlike putting a rabbit into the proverbial hat and then blaming the trial judge for \nmaking the insertion. \n \n…The precise question is whether the Chancellor’s articulated standard for bad faith corporate fiduciary \nconduct—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities—is legally \ncorrect. In approaching that question, we note that the Chancellor characterized that definition as \n“anappropriate (although not the only) standard for determining whether fiduciaries have acted in good \nfaith.” That observation is accurate and helpful, because as a matter of simple logic, at least three different \ncategories of fiduciary behavior are candidates for the “bad faith” pejorative label. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n705 \nThe first category involves so-called “subjective bad faith,” that is, fiduciary conduct motivated by an \nactual intent to do harm. That such conduct constitutes classic, quintessential bad faith is a proposition so \nwell accepted in the liturgy of fiduciary law that it borders on axiomatic.…The second category of conduct, \nwhich is at the opposite end of the spectrum, involves lack of due care—that is, fiduciary action taken \nsolely by reason of gross negligence and without any malevolent intent. In this case, appellants assert \nclaims of gross negligence to establish breaches not only of director due care but also of the directors’ duty \nto act in good faith. Although the Chancellor found, and we agree, that the appellants failed to establish \ngross negligence, to afford guidance we address the issue of whether gross negligence (including a failure \nto inform one’s self of available material facts), without more, can also constitute bad faith. The answer is \nclearly no. \n \n…”issues of good faith are (to a certain degree) inseparably and necessarily intertwined with the duties of \ncare and loyalty.…” But, in the pragmatic, conduct-regulating legal realm which calls for more precise \nconceptual line drawing, the answer is that grossly negligent conduct, without more, does not and cannot \nconstitute a breach of the fiduciary duty to act in good faith. The conduct that is the subject of due care \nmay overlap with the conduct that comes within the rubric of good faith in a psychological sense, but from \na legal standpoint those duties are and must remain quite distinct.… \n \nThe Delaware General Assembly has addressed the distinction between bad faith and a failure to exercise \ndue care (i.e., gross negligence) in two separate contexts.

The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del. C. § 145. To \noversimplify, subsections (a) and (b) of that statute permit a corporation to indemnify (inter alia) any \nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses…where \n(among other things): (i) that person is, was, or is threatened to be made a party to that action, suit or \nproceeding, and (ii) that person “acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be \nin or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.…” Thus, under Delaware statutory law a \ndirector or officer of a corporation can be indemnified for liability (and litigation expenses) incurred by \nreason of a violation of the duty of care, but not for a violation of the duty to act in good faith. \n \nSection 145, like Section 102(b)(7), evidences the intent of the Delaware General Assembly to afford \nsignificant protections to directors (and, in the case of Section 145, other fiduciaries) of Delaware \ncorporations. To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith. In our view it must be, for at least two reasons. \n \nFirst, the universe of fiduciary misconduct is not limited to either disloyalty in the classic sense (i.e., \npreferring the adverse self-interest of the fiduciary or of a related person to the interest of the \ncorporation) or gross negligence. Cases have arisen where corporate directors have no conflicting self-\ninterest in a decision, yet engage in misconduct that is more culpable than simple inattention or failure to \nbe informed of all facts material to the decision. To protect the interests of the corporation and its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n707 \nshareholders, fiduciary conduct of this kind, which does not involve disloyalty (as traditionally defined) \nbut is qualitatively more culpable than gross negligence, should be proscribed. A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

Recognize how the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has amended the 1934 act to increase corporate regulation, \ntransparency, and penalties. \n \n \nCorporations may be found liable if they engage in certain unlawful practices, several of which we explore \nin this section. \n \nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nInvestigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Watergate Special Prosecutor in \nthe early 1970s turned up evidence that hundreds of companies had misused corporate funds, mainly by \nbribing foreign officials to induce them to enter into contracts with or grant licenses to US companies. \nBecause revealing the bribes would normally be self-defeating and, in any event, could be expected to stir \nup immense criticism, companies paying bribes routinely hid the payments in various accounts. As a \nresult, one of many statutes enacted in the aftermath of Watergate, the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977, was incorporated into the 1934 Securities Exchange \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n725 \nAct. The SEC’s legal interest in the matter is not premised on the morality of bribery but rather on the \nfalsity of the financial statements that are being filed. \n \nCongress’s response to abuses of financial reporting, the FCPA, was much broader than necessary to treat \nthe violations that were uncovered. The FCPA prohibits an issuer (i.e., any US business enterprise), a \nstockholder acting on behalf of an issuer, and “any officer, director, employee, or agent” of an issuer from \nusing either the mails or interstate commerce corruptly to offer, pay, or promise to pay anything of value \nto foreign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates if the purpose is to gain business by inducing \nthe foreign official to influence an act of the government to render a decision favorable to the US \ncorporation. \n \nBut not all payments are illegal. Under 1988 amendments to the FCPA, payments may be made to \nexpedite routine governmental actions, such as obtaining a visa. And payments are allowed if they are \nlawful under the written law of a foreign country.

It is not limited to securities \nregistered under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. It is not limited to publicly held companies. It applies \nto any security issued by any company, including the smallest closely held company. In substance, it is an \nantifraud rule, enforcement of which seems, on its face, to be limited to action by the SEC. But over the \nyears, the courts have permitted people injured by those who violate the statute to file private damage \nsuits. This sweeping rule has at times been referred to as the “federal law of corporations” or the “catch \neverybody” rule. \n \nInsider trading ran headlong into Rule 10b-5 beginning in 1964 in a series of cases involving Texas Gulf \nSulphur Company (TGS). On November 12, 1963, the company discovered a rich deposit of copper and \nzinc while drilling for oil near Timmins, Ontario. Keeping the discovery quiet, it proceeded to acquire \nmineral rights in adjacent lands. By April 1964, word began to circulate about TGS’s find. \n \nNewspapers printed rumors, and the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced a wild speculative spree. On \nApril 12, an executive vice president of TGS issued a press release downplaying the discovery, asserting \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n728 \nthat the rumors greatly exaggerated the find and stating that more drilling would be necessary before \ncoming to any conclusions. Four days later, on April 16, TGS publicly announced that it had uncovered a \nstrike of 25 million tons of ore. In the months following this announcement, TGS stock doubled in value. \n \nThe SEC charged several TGS officers and directors with having purchased or told their friends, so-\ncalled tippees, to purchase TGS stock from November 12, 1963, through April 16, 1964, on the basis of \nmaterial inside information. The SEC also alleged that the April 12, 1964, press release was deceptive. The \nUS Court of Appeals, in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., [2] decided that the defendants who purchased the \nstock before the public announcement had violated Rule 10b-5. According to the court, “anyone in \npossession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is \ndisabled from disclosing to protect a corporate confidence, or he chooses not to do so, must abstain from \ntrading in or recommending the securities concerned while such inside information remains undisclosed.” \nOn remand, the district court ordered certain defendants to pay $148,000 into an escrow account to be \nused to compensate parties injured by the insider trading. \n \nThe court of appeals also concluded that the press release violated Rule 10b-5 if “misleading to the \nreasonable investor.” On remand, the district court held that TGS failed to exercise “due diligence” in \nissuing the release. Sixty-nine private damage actions were subsequently filed against TGS by \nshareholders who claimed they sold their stock in reliance on the release. The company settled most of \nthese suits in late 1971 for $2.7 million. \n \nFollowing the TGS episode, the Supreme Court refined Rule 10b-5 on several fronts. First, in Ernst & \nErnst v. Hochfelder, [3] the Court decided that proof of scienter—defined as “mental state embracing \nintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”—is required in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In \nother words, negligence alone will not result in Rule 10b-5 liability. The Court also held that scienter, \nwhich is an intentional act, must be established in SEC injunctive actions. [4] \n \nThe Supreme Court has placed limitations on the liability of tippees under Rule 10b-5.

The Court also explicitly has defined a standard of materiality under the securities \nlaws, see TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), concluding in the proxy-solicitation \ncontext that “[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n738 \nwould consider it important in deciding how to vote.”…We now expressly adopt the TSC Industries \nstandard of materiality for the 5 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. \n \nThe application of this materiality standard to preliminary merger discussions is not self-evident. Where \nthe impact of the corporate development on the target’s fortune is certain and clear, the TSC Industries \nmateriality definition admits straight-forward application. Where, on the other hand, the event is \ncontingent or speculative in nature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the “reasonable investor” would \nhave considered the omitted information significant at the time. Merger negotiations, because of the ever-\npresent possibility that the contemplated transaction will not be effectuated, fall into the latter category. \n \n* * * \n \nEven before this Court’s decision in TSC Industries, the Second Circuit had explained the role of the \nmateriality requirement of Rule 10b-5, with respect to contingent or speculative information or events, in \na manner that gave that term meaning that is independent of the other provisions of the Rule. Under such \ncircumstances, materiality “will depend at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated \nprobability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of \nthe company activity.” SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d, at 849. \n \n* * * \n \nWhether merger discussions in any particular case are material therefore depends on the facts. Generally, \nin order to assess the probability that the event will occur, a factfinder will need to look to indicia of \ninterest in the transactions at the highest corporate levels. Without attempting to catalog all such possible \nfactors, we note by way of example that board resolutions, instructions to investment bankers, and actual \nnegotiations between principals or their intermediaries may serve as indicia of interest. To assess the \nmagnitude of the transaction to the issuer of the securities allegedly manipulated, a factfinder will need to \nconsider such facts as the size of the two corporate entities and of the potential premiums over market \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n739 \nvalue. No particular event or factor short of closing the transaction need to be either necessary or \nsufficient by itself to render merger discussions material. \n \nAs we clarify today, materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the \nwithheld or misrepresented information. The fact-specific inquiry we endorse here is consistent with the \napproach a number of courts have taken in assessing the materiality of merger negotiations. Because the \nstandard of materiality we have adopted differs from that used by both courts below, we remand the case \nfor reconsideration of the question whether a grant of summary judgment is appropriate on this record. \n \nWe turn to the question of reliance and the fraud on-the-market theory. Succinctly put: \n \nThe fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed \nsecurities market, the price of a company’s stock is determined by the available information \nregarding the company and its business.…Misleading statements will therefore defraud \npurchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.…The causal \nconnection between the defendants’ fraud and the plaintiff’s purchase of stock in such a case is no \nless significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. Peil v. Speiser, 806 F.2d \n1154, 1160-1161 (CA3 1986). \n \n* * * \nWe agree that reliance is an element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action.

How does the court determine what is or is not material information? How does this differ from its previous \nrulings? \n2. What is the fraud-on-the-market theory? \n \n \n \n17.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nBeyond state corporation laws, federal statutes—most importantly, the Securities Act of 1933 and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934—regulate the issuance and trading of corporate securities. The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company. This law requires issuers to keep accurate \nsets of books reflecting the dispositions of their assets and to maintain internal accounting controls to \nensure that transactions comport with management’s authorization. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 presents special hazards to those trading in public stock on the basis \nof inside information. One provision requires the reimbursement to the company of any profits made \nfrom selling and buying stock during a six-month period by directors, officers, and shareholders owning \n10 percent or more of the company’s stock. Under Rule 10b-5, the SEC and private parties may sue \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n742 \ninsiders who traded on information not available to the general public, thus gaining an advantage in \neither selling or buying the stock. Insiders include company employees. \n \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act amended the 1934 act, creating more stringent penalties, increasing corporate \nregulation, and requiring greater transparency. \n \nEXERCISES",

            "chunk": "provides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect. Many of the laws expressly gave management of the target companies a right to a hearing, which \ncould be dragged out for weeks or months, giving the target time to build up a defense. The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana second-\ngeneration statute that prevents an offeror who has acquired 20 percent or more of a target’s stock from \nvoting unless other shareholders (not including management) approve. The vote to approve can be \ndelayed for up to fifty days from the date the offeror files a statement reporting the acquisition. The Court \nconcluded that the Commerce Clause was not violated nor was the Williams Act, because the Indiana law, \nunlike the Illinois law in Mite, was consistent with the Williams Act, since it protects shareholders, does \nnot unreasonably delay the tender offer, and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. [6] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n753 \nEmboldened by the CTS decision, almost half the states have adopted a third-generation law that requires \na bidder to wait several years before merging with the target company unless the target’s board agrees in \nadvance to the merger. Because in many cases a merger is the reason for the bid, these laws are especially \npowerful. In 1989, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wisconsin’s third-generation law, saying \nthat it did not violate the Commerce Clause and that it was not preempted by the Williams Act. The \nSupreme Court decided not to review the decision. [7] \n \nShort-Form Mergers \nIf one company acquires 90 percent or more of the stock of another company, it can merge with the target \ncompany through the so-called short-form merger. Only the parent company’s board of directors need \napprove the merger; consent of the shareholders of either company is unnecessary. \n \nAppraisal Rights \nIf a shareholder has the right to vote on a corporate plan to merge, consolidate, or sell all or substantially \nall of its assets, that shareholder has the right to dissent and invoke appraisal rights. Returning again to \nBCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the \nwisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying \nTruckman. The law requires the shareholder to file with the corporation, before the vote, a notice of \nintention to demand the fair value of his shares. If the plan is approved and the shareholder does not vote \nin favor, the corporation must send a notice to the shareholder specifying procedures for obtaining \npayment, and the shareholder must demand payment within the time set in the notice, which cannot be \nless than thirty days. Fair value means the value of shares immediately before the effective date of the \ncorporate action to which the shareholder has objected. Appreciation and depreciation in anticipation of \nthe action are excluded, unless the exclusion is unfair. \n \nIf the shareholder and the company cannot agree on the fair value, the shareholder must file a petition \nrequesting a court to determine the fair value. The method of determining fair value depends on the \ncircumstances. When there is a public market for stock traded on an exchange, fair value is usually the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n754 \nprice quoted on the exchange. In some circumstances, other factors, especially net asset value and \ninvestment value—for example, earnings potential—assume greater importance. \n \nSee Hariton v. Arco Electronics, Inc.

Not even the sequestration of \nthe assets at the hands of a receiver will terminate its being.” [1] \n \nSee http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98703,00.html for the Internal Revenue Service’s \nchecklist of closing and dissolving a business. State and local government regulations may also apply. \n \nVoluntary Dissolution \nAny corporation may be dissolved with the unanimous written consent of the shareholders; this is \na voluntary dissolution. This provision is obviously applicable primarily to closely held corporations. \nDissolution can also be accomplished even if some shareholders dissent. The directors must first adopt a \nresolution by majority vote recommending the dissolution. The shareholders must then have an \nopportunity to vote on the resolution at a meeting after being notified of its purpose. A majority of the \noutstanding voting shares is necessary to carry the resolution. Although this procedure is most often used \nwhen a company has been inactive, nothing bars its use by large corporations. In 1979, UV Industries, \n357th on the Fortune 500 list, with profits of $40 million annually, voted to dissolve and to distribute \nsome $500 million to its stockholders, in part as a means of fending off a hostile takeover. Fortune \nmagazine referred to it as “a company that’s worth more dead than alive.” [2] \n \nOnce dissolution has been approved, the corporation may dissolve by filing a certificate or articles of \ndissolution with the secretary of state. The certificate may be filed as the corporation begins to wind up its \naffairs or at any time thereafter. The process of winding up is liquidation. The company must notify all \ncreditors of its intention to liquidate. It must collect and dispose of its assets, discharge all obligations, \nand distribute any remainder to its stockholders. \n \nInvoluntary Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n761 \nIn certain cases, a corporation can face involuntary dissolution. A state may bring an action to \ndissolve a corporation on one of five grounds: failure to file an annual report or pay taxes, fraud in \nprocuring incorporation, exceeding or abusing authority conferred, failure for thirty days to appoint and \nmaintain a registered agent, and failure to notify the state of a change of registered office or agent. State-\nspecific differences exist as well. Delaware permits its attorney general to involuntarily dissolve a \ncorporation for abuse, misuse, or nonuse of corporate powers, privileges, or franchise. [3] California, on the \nother hand, permits involuntary dissolution for abandonment of a business, board deadlocks, internal \nstrife and deadlocked shareholders, mismanagement, fraud or abuse of authority, expiration of term of \ncorporation, or protection of a complaining shareholder if there are fewer than thirty-five \nshareholders. [4]California permits the initiation of involuntary dissolution by either half of the directors in \noffice or by a third of shareholders. \n \nJudicial Liquidation \nAction by Shareholder \nA shareholder may file suit to have a court dissolve the company on a showing that the company is being \nirreparably injured because the directors are deadlocked in the management of corporate affairs and the \nshareholders cannot break the deadlock. Shareholders may also sue for liquidation if corporate assets are \nbeing misapplied or wasted, or if directors or those in control are acting illegally, oppressively, or \nfraudulently. \n \nClaims against a Dissolved Corporation \nUnder Sections 14.06 and 14.07 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act, a dissolved corporation \nmust provide written notice of the dissolution to its creditors. The notice must state a deadline, which \nmust be at least 120 days after the notice, for receipt of creditors’ claims. Claims not received by the \ndeadline are barred. The corporation may also publish a notice of the dissolution in a local newspaper. \nCreditors who do not receive written notice or whose claim is not acted on have five years to file suit \nagainst the corporation. If the corporate assets have been distributed, shareholders are personally liable, \nalthough the liability may not exceed the assets received at liquidation. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n762 \nBankruptcy \nAs an alternative to dissolution, a corporation in financial trouble may look to federal bankruptcy law for \nrelief. A corporation may use liquidation proceedings under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act or \nmay be reorganized under Chapter 11 of the act. Both remedies are discussed in detail in Chapter 27 \n\"Bankruptcy\". \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nDissolution is the end of the legal existence of a corporation. It usually occurs after liquidation, which is the \nprocess of paying debts and distributing assets. There are several methods by which a corporation may be \ndissolved.

There are several generally recognized exceptions, such as when \nthe asset purchase is fraudulent or to avoid creditors. Some states have added additional exceptions, such \nas in cases involving products liability. \n \nIn a merger, the acquired company is absorbed into the acquiring company and goes out of business. The \nacquiring corporation assumes the other company’s debts. Unless the articles of incorporation say \notherwise, a majority of directors and shareholders of both corporations must approve the merger. There \nare two main types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. A consolidation is virtually the same \nas a merger, except that the resulting entity is a new corporation. \n \nA corporation may take over another company by purchasing a controlling interest of its stock, commonly \nreferred to as a takeover. This is accomplished by appealing directly to the target company’s shareholders. \nIn the case of a large publicly held corporation, the appeal is known as a tender offer, which is not an offer \nbut an invitation to shareholders to tender their stock at a stated price. A leveraged buyout involves using \nthe target corporation’s assets as security for a loan used to purchase the target. \nA shareholder has the right to fair value for his stock if he dissents from a plan to merge, consolidate, or \nsell all or substantially all of the corporate assets, referred to as appraisal rights. If there is disagreement \nover the value, the shareholder has the right to a court appraisal. When one company acquires 90 percent \nof the stock of another, it may merge with the target through a short-form merger, which eliminates the \nrequirement of consent of shareholders and the target company’s board. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n771 \nCertain federal regulations are implicated in corporate expansion, particularly the Williams Act. States \nmay impose conditions on admission of a foreign corporation to do business of a purely local nature but \nnot if its business is exclusively interstate in character, which would violate the Commerce Clause. Among \nthe requirements are obtaining a certificate of authority from the secretary of state and maintaining a \nregistered office with a registered agent. But certain activities do not constitute doing business, such as \nfiling lawsuits and collecting debts, and may be carried on even if the corporation is not licensed to do \nbusiness in a state. Under long-arm statutes, state courts have jurisdiction over foreign corporations as \nlong as the corporations have minimum contacts in the state. States may also tax corporate activities as \nlong as the tax does not unduly burden interstate commerce. \n \nDissolution is the legal termination of a corporation’s existence, as distinguished from liquidation, the \nprocess of paying debts and distributing assets. A corporation may be dissolved by shareholders if they \nunanimously agree in writing, or by majority vote of the directors and shareholders. A corporation may \nalso be dissolved involuntarily on one of five grounds, including failure to file an annual report or to pay \ntaxes. Shareholders may sue for judicial liquidation on a showing that corporate assets are being wasted \nor directors or officers are acting illegally or fraudulently. \n \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing.

But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law. All states except New York and North Carolina have adopted \nArticles 3 and 4. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n780 \nThe Future of Commercial Paper: Federal and International Preemption \nState law governing commercial paper is vulnerable to federal preemption. This preemption could take \ntwo major forms. First, the Federal Reserve Board governs the activities of Federal Reserve Banks. As a \nresult, Federal Reserve regulations provide important guidelines for the check collection process. Second, \nArticle 3 of the UCC can be preempted by federal statutes. An important example is the Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act, which became effective in 1988 (discussed in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"). \n \nFederal preemption may also become intertwined with international law. In 1988, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International \nPromissory Notes. Progress on the treaty emanating from the convention has been slow, however: the \nUnited States, Canada, and Russia have approved the convention (in 1989 and 1990) but have not ratified \nthe treaty; Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Liberia, and Mexico are the only countries to have ratified it. \n \nCommercial Paper in Economics and Finance \nEconomics \nTo the economist, one type of commercial paper—the bank check—is the primary component of M1, the \nbasic money supply. It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

The key to the success of this invention is the concept of negotiability: through \nthis process, a person can pass on—in most cases—better title to receive payment than he had; thus the \ntransferee of such paper will most likely get paid by the obligor and will not be subject to most defenses of \nany prior holders. The law of commercial paper has developed over the past four hundred years. It is now the \nUniform Commercial Code that governs most commercial paper transactions in the United States, but federal \nor international preemption is possible in the future. Commercial paper is important in both economics and \nfinance. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. If there were no such thing as commercial paper, real or virtual (electronic funds transfers), how would you \npay your bills? How did merchants have to pay their bills four hundred years ago? \n2. What is it about negotiability that it is the key to the success of commercial paper? \n3. How could state law—the UCC—be preempted in regard to commercial paper? \n \n \n \n19.2 Scope of Article 3 and Types of Commercial Paper and \nParties \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n782 \n1. Understand the scope of Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Recognize the types of commercial paper: drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit. \n3. Give the names of the various parties to commercial paper. \n \n \nScope of Article 3 \nArticle 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) covers commercial paper but explicitly excludes money, \ndocuments of title, and investment securities. Documents of title include bills of lading and warehouse \nreceipts and are governed by Article 7 of the UCC. Investment securities are covered by Article 8. \nInstruments that fall within the scope of Article 3 may also be subject to Article 4 (bank deposits and \ncollections), Article 8 (securities), and Article 9 (secured transactions). If so, the rules of these other \narticles supersede the provisions of Article 3 to the extent of conflict. Article 3 is a set of general provisions \non negotiability; the other articles deal more narrowly with specific transactions or instruments. \n \nTypes of Commercial Paper \nThere are four types of commercial paper: drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit. \n \n \nDrafts \nA draft is an unconditional written order by one person (the drawer) directing another person (the \ndrawee) to pay a certain sum of money on demand or at a definite time to a named third person (the \npayee) or to bearer. The draft is one of the two basic types of commercial paper; the other is the note. As \nindicated by its definition, the draft is a three-party transaction. \n \nParties to a Draft \nThe drawer is one who directs a person or an entity, usually a bank, to pay a sum of money stated in an \ninstrument—for example, a person who makes a draft or writes a check. The drawer prepares a document \n(a form, usually)—the draft—ordering the drawee to remit a stated sum of money to the payee. The \ndrawee is the person or entity that a draft is directed to and that is ordered to pay the amount stated on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n783 \nit. The most common drawee is a bank. The drawer, drawee, and payee need not be different people; the \nsame person may have different capacities in a single transaction. For example, a drawer (the person \nasking that payment be made) may also be the payee (the person to whom the payment is to be made). A \ndrawee who signs the draft becomes an acceptor: the drawee pledges to honor the draft as written. To \naccept, the drawee need only sign her name on the draft, usually vertically on the face, but anywhere will \ndo. Words such as “accepted” or “good” are unnecessary. However, a drawee who indicates that she might \nrefuse to pay will not be held to have accepted. Thus in the archetypal case, the court held that a drawee \nwho signed his name and appended the words “Kiss my foot” did not accept the draft. [1] \n \nThe drawer directs the funds to be drawn from—pulled from—the drawee, and the drawee pays the person",

[1] \n \nThe drawer directs the funds to be drawn from—pulled from—the drawee, and the drawee pays the person \nentitled to payment as directed. \n \nTypes of Drafts \nDrafts can be divided into two broad subcategories: sight drafts and time drafts. \n \nA sight draft calls for payment “on sight,” that is, when presented. Recall from Section 19.1 \n\"Introduction to Commercial Paper\" that Lorna Love wished to buy tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc. \nSuppose Love had the money to pay but did not want to do so before delivery. Rackets, on the other hand, \ndid not want to ship before Love paid. The solution: a sight draft, drawn on Love, to which would be \nattached an order bill of lading that Rackets received from the trucker when it shipped the rackets. The \nsight draft and bill of lading go to a bank in Love’s city. When the tennis rackets arrive, the carrier notifies \nthe bank, which presents the draft to Love for payment. When she has done so, the bank gives Love the \nbill of lading, entitling her to receive the shipment. The bank forwards the payment to Rackets’ bank, \nwhich credits Rackets’ account with the purchase amount. \n \nA time draft, not surprisingly, calls for payment on a date specified in the draft. Suppose that Love will \nnot have sufficient cash to pay until she has sold the rackets but that Rackets needs to be paid \nimmediately. The solution: a common form of time draft known as a trade acceptance. Rackets, the seller, \ndraws a draft on Love, who thus becomes a drawee. The draft orders Love to pay the purchase price to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n784 \norder of Rackets, as payee, on a fixed date. Rackets presents the draft to Love, who accepts it by signing \nher name. Rackets then can indorse the draft (by signing it) and sell it, at a discount, to its bank or some \nother financial institution. Rackets thus gets its money right away; the bank may collect from Love on the \ndate specified. See the example of a time draft in Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\". \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.3 A Time Draft \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n785 \nDrafts in International Trade \nDrafts are an international convention. In England and the British Commonwealth, drafts are called bills \nof exchange. Like a draft, a bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest. Used \nprimarily in international trade, it is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a \nspecific date sometime in the future. If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft. If \nit is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft. Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a \ndraft, but whereas a draft is always negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true \nof a bill of exchange. \n \nA widely used draft in international trade is the banker’s acceptance. It is a short-term credit \ninvestment created by a nonfinancial firm and guaranteed by a bank. This instrument is used when an \nexporter agrees to extend credit to an importer. \n \nAssume Love, the importer, is in New York; Rackets, the exporter, is in Taiwan. Rackets is willing to \npermit Love to pay ninety days after shipment. Love makes a deal with her New York bank to issue \nRackets’ bank in Taiwan a letter of credit. This tells the seller’s bank that the buyer’s bank is willing to \naccept a draft drawn on the buyer in accordance with terms spelled out in the letter of credit. Love’s bank \nmay insist on a security interest in the tennis rackets, or it may conclude that Love is creditworthy. On \nreceipt of the letter of credit, Rackets presents its bank in Taiwan with a draft drawn on Love’s bank. That \nbank antes up the purchase amount (less its fees and interest), paying Rackets directly. It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786",

Pertinent to the issues on \nthis appeal, Centerre’s petition averred: \n \n“1. …on [May 7,] 1985, the [Campbells] made and delivered to Strand…their promissory note…and \nthereby promised to pay to Strand…or its order…($11,250.00) with interest thereon from date at the rate \nof fourteen percent (14%) per annum; that a copy of said promissory note is attached hereto…and \nincorporated herein by reference. \n \n2. That thereafter and before maturity, said note was assigned and delivered by Strand…to [Centerre] for \nvaluable consideration and [Centerre] is the owner and holder of said promissory note.” \n \nCenterre’s petition went on to allege that default had been made in payment of the note and that there was \nan unpaid principal balance of $9,000, plus accrued interest, due thereon. Centerre’s petition prayed for \njudgment against the Campbells for the unpaid principal and interest. \n \n[The Campbells] aver that the note was given for the purchase of an interest in a limited partnership to be \ncreated by Strand, that no limited partnership was thereafter created by Strand, and that by reason \nthereof there was “a complete and total failure of consideration for the said promissory note.” \nConsequently, pled the answers, Centerre “should be estopped from asserting a claim against [the \nCampbells] on said promissory note because of such total failure of consideration for same.” \n \nThe cause was tried to the court, all parties having waived trial by jury. At trial, the attorney for the \nCampbells asked Curtis D. Campbell what the consideration was for the note. Centerre’s attorney \ninterrupted: “We object to any testimony as to the consideration for the note because it’s our position that \nis not a defense in this lawsuit since the bank is the holder in due course.”… \n \n \nThe trial court entered judgment in favor of Centerre and against the Campbells for $9,000, plus accrued \ninterest and costs. The trial court filed no findings of fact or conclusions of law, none having been \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n801 \nrequested. The trial court did, however, include in its judgment a finding that Centerre “is a holder in due \ncourse of the promissory note sued upon.” \n \nThe Campbells appeal, briefing four points. Their first three, taken together, present a single hypothesis of \nerror consisting of these components: (a) the Campbells showed “by clear and convincing evidence a valid \nand meritorious defense in that there existed a total lack and failure of consideration for the promissory \nnote in question,” (b) Centerre acquired the note subject to such defense in that Centerre was not a holder \nin due course, as one can be a holder in due course of a note only if the note is a negotiable instrument, \nand (c) the note was not a negotiable instrument inasmuch as “it failed to state a sum certain due the \npayee.”… \n \nWe have already noted that if Centerre is not a holder in due course, the Campbells can assert the defense \nof failure of consideration against Centerre to the same degree they could have asserted it against Strand. \nWe have also spelled out that Centerre cannot be a holder in due course if the note is not a negotiable \ninstrument. The pivotal issue, therefore, is whether the provision that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand prevents the note from being a negotiable instrument.… \n \nNeither side has cited a Missouri case applying [UCC 3-104(a)] to a note containing a provision similar to: \n“Interest may vary with bank rates charged to Strand.” Our independent research has likewise proven \nfruitless. There are, however, instructive decisions from other jurisdictions. \n \nIn Taylor v. Roeder, [Citation, Virginia] (1987), a note provided for interest at “[t]hree percent (3.00%) \nover Chase Manhattan prime to be adjusted monthly.” A second note provided for interest at “3% over \nChase Manhattan prime adjusted monthly.” Applying sections of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted \nby Virginia identical to [the Missouri UCC], the court held the notes were not negotiable instruments in \nthat the amounts required to satisfy them could not be ascertained without reference to an extrinsic \nsource, the varying prime rate of interest charged by Chase Manhattan Bank. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n802 \nIn Branch Banking and Trust Co. v. Creasy, [Citation, North Carolina] (1980), a guaranty agreement \nprovided that the aggregate amount of principal of all indebtedness and liabilities at any one time for \nwhich the guarantor would be liable shall not exceed $35,000. The court, emphasizing that to be a \nnegotiable instrument a writing must contain, among other things, an unconditional promise to pay a sum \ncertain in money, held the agreement was not a negotiable instrument.

The defendant owns and operates New York’s largest \nthoroughbred racetracks—Belmont Park Racetrack, Aqueduct Racetrack, and Saratoga Racetrack—where \nit stages thoroughbred horse races and conducts pari-mutuel wagering on them pursuant to a franchise \ngranted to the defendant by the State of New York. \n \nThe plaintiff was a Belmont Park Racetrack horse player. He attended the track and purchased from the \ndefendant a voucher for use in SAMS machines. As explained in [Citation]: \nIn addition to accepting bets placed at parimutuel facility windows staffed by facility employees, \n[some] facilities use SAMS. SAMS are automated machines which permit a bettor to enter his bet \nby inserting money, vouchers or credit cards into the machine, thereby enabling him to select the \nnumber or combination he wishes to purchase. A ticket is issued showing those numbers. [1] \n \nWhen a voucher is utilized for the purpose of placing a bet at a SAMS machine, the SAMS machine, after \ndeducting the amount bet by the horse player during the particular transaction, provides the horse player \nwith, in addition to his betting ticket(s), a new voucher showing the remaining balance left on the \nvoucher. \n \nIn the instant case, the unfortunate horse player departed the SAMS machine with his betting tickets, \nbut without his new voucher—showing thousands of dollars in remaining value—which he inadvertently \nleft sitting in the SAMS machine. Within several minutes he realized his mistake and hurried back to the \nSAMS machine, only to find the voucher gone. He immediately notified a security guard. The defendant’s \npersonnel thereafter quickly confirmed the plaintiff as the original purchaser of the lost voucher. The \ndefendant placed a computerized “stop” on the voucher. However, whoever had happened upon the \nvoucher in the SAMS machine and taken it had acted even more quickly: the voucher had been brought to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n832 \na nearby track window and “cashed out” within a minute or so of the plaintiff having mistakenly left it in \nthe SAMS machine. \n \nThe plaintiff now sues the defendant, contending that the defendant should be liable for having failed to \n“provide any minimal protection to its customers” in checking the identity and ownership of vouchers \nprior to permitting their “cash out.” The defendant, in response, contends that the voucher consists of \n“bearer paper,” negotiable by anyone having possession, and that it is under no obligation to purchasers \nof vouchers to provide any such identity or ownership checks. \n \nAs opposed to instruments such as ordinary checks, which are typically made payable to the order of a \nspecific person and are therefore known as “order paper,” bearer paper is payable to the “bearer,” i.e., \nwhoever walks in carrying (or “bearing”) the instrument. Pursuant to [New York’s UCC] “[a]n instrument \nis payable to bearer when by its terms it is payable to…(c) ‘cash’ or the order of ‘cash’, or any other \nindication which does not purport to designate a specific payee.” \n \nEach New York Racing Association voucher is labeled “Cash Voucher.” Each voucher contains the legend \n“Bet Against the Value or Exchange for Cash.” Each voucher is also encoded with certain computer \nsymbols which are readable by SAMS machines. The vouchers do by their terms constitute “bearer paper.” \n \nThere is no doubt that under the [1990 Revision] Model Uniform Commercial Code the defendant would \nbe a “holder in due course” of the voucher, deemed to have taken it free from all defenses that could be \nraised by the plaintiff. As observed in 2 White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code pp. 225–226, 152–\n153 (4th ed.1995): \n \nConsider theft of bearer instruments…[T]he thief can make his or her transferee a holder simply \nby transfer to one who gives value in good faith. If the thief’s transferee cashes the check and so \ngives value in good faith and without notice of any defense, that transferee will be a holder in due \ncourse under 3-302, free of all claims to the instrument on the part…of any person and free of all \npersonal defenses of any prior party. Therefore, the holder in due course will not be liable in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n833 \nconversion to the true owner.…Of course, the owner of the check will have a good cause of action \nagainst the thief, but no other cause of action.… \n \nIf an instrument is payable to bearer…the possessor of the instrument will be a holder and, if he \nmeets the other tests, a holder in due course. This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York.

No cashier check to Wisner \nElevator was issued; instead the entire amount was deposited into Gill’s checking account as per Gill’s \ndeposit ticket. \n \n…On May 28, 2002, Wisner filed suit against the bank, claiming that its failure to apply the funds as per \nthe restrictive indorsement constituted a conversion of the portion of the check due to Wisner under UCC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n844 \n3-206(c)(2) [that a depositary bank converts an instrument if it pays out on an indorsement “indicating a \npurpose of having the instrument collected for the indorser or for a particular account”]. \n \n[The bank] asserted that the indorsement on the back of the check was a conditional indorsement and \nineffective under 3-206(b), [which states:] \n \nAn indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect \nthe right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it \nfor value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person \nare not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled. \n \n…[T]he bank asserts the fault of the United States Treasury…, in failing to make the check payable to both \nGill and Wisner. To the extent that the indorsement was conditional, the bank contends that it was \nunenforceable; to the extent that it was restrictive, it maintains that the restrictions were waived by the \nindorser when he deposited the full amount of the check into his own checking account. \n \nWisner…[stated that it] was owed $13,200.50 by Gill for seeds, chemicals, crop supplies and agricultural \nseed technology fees. [It] further stated that Gill never paid the $13,200.50 he owed and that Wisner did \nnot receive a cashier’s check issued in that amount by Richland State Bank.…According to [the bank \nteller], Gill asked to deposit the entire amount in his account. She further stated that the bank was \nunaware that the indorsement was written by someone other than Gill. \n \n…The court found that the typed indorsement placed on the check was the indorsement of the maker, not \nGill. However, when Gill signed below the indorsement, he made it his own indorsement. The court \nconcluded that Gill had the legal power and authority to verbally instruct that the entire proceeds be \ndeposited into his account. The court stated that as long as the indorsement was his own, whether it was \nrestrictive or conditional, Gill had the power to ignore it, strike it out or give contrary instructions. The \ncourt further concluded that the bank acted properly when it followed the verbal instructions given by Gill \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n845 \nto the teller and the written instructions on his deposit slip to deposit the entire proceeds into Gill’s \naccount. Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the",

Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that \nalone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating \nthe instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on \nthe instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying \nwords is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n846 \nsignature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a \npurpose other than indorsement. \n \nThis paragraph was placed on the back of the check by the government as the maker or drawer of the \ncheck. Consequently, the bank argues that Gill as sole payee could waive, ignore or strike out the \nlanguage. \n \nAlthough the Louisiana jurisprudence contains no similar case dealing with the Uniform Commercial \nCode, we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance…In [Citation, a New Jersey case] (1975), the drawer \nof a check placed instructions on the backs of several checks…that the instruments not be deposited until \na specific future date. However, the payee presented some of the checks prior to the date specified on the \nback. The court found that the drawer did not have the capacity to indorse the instruments; as a result the \ntyped instructions on the backs of the checks could not be indorsements. Instead, they were “merely \nrequests to plaintiff who may or may not comply at its own pleasure. The instructions are neither binding \non plaintiff nor the subsequent holders.” In other words, the payee could ignore the instructions. \n \nIn the instant case, the payee did precisely that. Gill ignored the writing on the back of the check and \ninstructed the teller at the defendant bank to do the same through verbal and written instructions. \n \nWisner argues that by affixing his signature under the writing on the back of the check, Gill made it his \nown indorsement. Furthermore, it asserts that it was a restrictive indorsement, not a conditional one \nwhich could be disregarded pursuant to 3-206. Wisner relies upon the provisions of 3-206 for the \nproposition that the check had a restrictive indorsement and that the bank converted the check because it \nfailed to apply the amount it paid consistently with the indorsement. However, Comment 3 to 3-206 \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \nThis Article does not displace the law of waiver as it may apply to restrictive indorsements. The \ncircumstances under which a restrictive indorsement may be waived by the person who made it \nis not determined by this Article. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n847 \n \nNot all jurisdictions recognize a doctrine of waiver of restrictive indorsements. [Citing cases from various \njurisdictions in which a bank customer effectively requested the bank to disregard a restrictive \nindorsement; some cases affirmed the concept that the restriction could be waived (disregarded), others \ndid not.] \n \n… \n \nIn two cases arising under pre-UCC law, Louisiana recognized that indorsements could be ignored or \nstruck out. In [Citation] (1925), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that the holder of a check could erase \nor strike out a restrictive indorsement on a check that was not necessary to the holder’s title. In [Citation] \n(1967), the court stated that an erroneous indorsement could be ignored and even struck out as \nunnecessary to the plaintiff’s title. \n \nLike the trial court, we find that when Gill affixed his signature under the writing on the back of the check, \nhe made it his own indorsement. We further find that the indorsement was restrictive, not conditional. As \nGill’s own restrictive indorsement, he could waive it and direct that the check, upon which he was \ndesignated as the sole payee, be deposited in his account in its entirety. \n \nAffirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS",

So a holder is one who \npossesses an instrument and who has all the necessary indorsements. \n \nTaken for Value \nSection 3-303 of the UCC describes what is meant by transferring an instrument “for value.” In a broad \nsense, it means the holder has given something for it, which sounds like consideration. But “value” here is \nnot the same as consideration under contract law. Here is the UCC language: \n \nAn instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply: \n \n(1) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the \npromise has been performed. \n(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien \nobtained by judicial proceeding. \n(3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim \nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n856 \n(4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. \n(5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable \nobligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument. \n \n1. For a promise, to the extent performed. Suppose A contracts with B: “I’ll buy your car for $5,000.” \nUnder contract law, A has given consideration: the promise is enough. But this executory (not yet \nperformed) promise given by A is not giving “value” to support the HDC status because the promise has \nnot been performed. \n \nLorna Love sells her car to Paul Purchaser for $5,000, and Purchaser gives her a note in that amount. \nLove negotiates the note to Rackets, Inc., for a new shipment of tennis rackets to be delivered in thirty \ndays. Rackets never delivers the tennis rackets. Love has a claim for $5,000 against Rackets, which is not \nan HDC because its promise to deliver is still executory. Assume Paul Purchaser has a defense against \nLove (a reason why he doesn’t want to pay on the note), perhaps because the car was defective. When \nRackets presents the note to Purchaser for payment, he refuses to pay, raising his defense against Love. If \nRackets had been an HDC, Purchaser would be obligated to pay on the note regardless of the defense he \nmight have had against Love, the payee. See Carter & Grimsley v. Omni Trading, Inc., Section 21.3 \n\"Cases\", regarding value as related to executory contracts. \n \nA taker for value can be a partial HDC if the consideration was only partly performed. Suppose the tennis \nrackets were to come in two lots, each worth $2,500, and Rackets only delivered one lot. Rackets would be \nan HDC only to the extent of $2,500, and the debtor—Paul Purchaser—could refuse to pay $2,500 of the \npromised sum. \n \nThe UCC presents two exceptions to the rule that an executory promise is not value. Section 3-303(a)(4) \nprovides that an instrument is issued or transferred for value if the issuer or transferor gives it in \nexchange for a negotiable instrument, and Section 3-303(5) says an instrument is transferred for value if \nthe issuer gives it in exchange for an irrevocable obligation to a third party. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n857 \n2. Security interest. Value is not limited to cash or the fulfillment of a contractual obligation. A holder \nwho acquires a lien on, or a security interest in, an instrument other than by legal process has taken for \nvalue. \n \n3. Antecedent debt. Likewise, taking an instrument in payment of, or as security for, a prior claim, \nwhether or not the claim is due, is a taking for value. Blackstone owes Webster $1,000, due in thirty days. \nBlackstone unexpectedly receives a refund check for $1,000 from the Internal Revenue Service and \nindorses it to Webster. Webster is an HDC though he gave value in the past. \n \nThe rationale for the rule of value is that if the holder has not yet given anything of value in exchange for \nthe instrument, he still has an effective remedy should the instrument prove defective: he can rescind the \ntransaction, given the transferor’s breach of warranty. \n \nIn Good Faith \nSection 3-103(4) of the UCC defines good faith as “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable \ncommercial standards of fair dealing.” \n \nHonesty in Fact \n“Honesty in fact” is subjectively tested. Suppose Lorna Love had given Rackets, Inc., a promissory note for \nthe tennis rackets. Knowing that it intended to deliver defective tennis rackets and that Love is likely to \nprotest as soon as the shipment arrives, Rackets offers a deep discount on the note to its fleet mechanic: \ninstead of the $1,000 face value of the note, Rackets will give it to him in payment of an outstanding bill of \n$400. The mechanic, being naive in commercial dealings, has no suspicion from the large discount that \nRackets might be committing fraud. He has acted in good faith under the UCC test.

Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn.

Judge Hoens concluded that because the \ncheck cashing companies took the checks in good faith, plaintiff was a holder in due course as assignee. \nJudge Hoens also found that because the checks appeared to be genuine, Hauser Co. was required, but \nhad failed, to show that plaintiff’s assignor had any notice that the checks were not validly drawn.… \n \nHauser Co. argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because the court failed to properly \naddress Hauser Co.’s defense that the checks at issue were invalid negotiable instruments and therefore \nerred in finding plaintiff was a holder in due course. \n \nAs a threshold matter, it is evident that the eighteen checks meet the definition of a negotiable instrument \n[UCC 3-104]. Each check is payable to a bearer for a fixed amount, on demand, and does not state any \nother undertaking by the person promising payment, aside from the payment of money. In addition, each \ncheck appears to have been signed by Mr. Hauser, through the use of a facsimile stamp, permitted by the \nUCC to take the place of a manual signature. [Section 3-401(b) of the UCC] provides that a “signature may \nbe made manually or by means of a device or machine…with present intention to authenticate a writing.” \nIt is uncontroverted by Hauser Co. that the facsimile signature stamp on the checks is identical to Hauser \nCo.’s authorized stamp. \n \nHauser Co., however, contends that the checks are not negotiable instruments because Mr. Hauser did not \nsign the checks, did not authorize their signing, and its payroll service, ADP, did not produce the checks. \nLack of authorization, however, is a separate issue from whether the checks are negotiable instruments. \nConsequently, given that the checks are negotiable instruments, the next issue is whether the checks are \nunenforceable by a holder in due course, because the signature on the checks was forged or unauthorized. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n879 \n \n[Sections 3-203 and 3-302 of the UCC] discuss the rights of a holder in due course and the rights of a \ntransferee of a holder in due course.

The liability of an agent who signs commercial paper \n2. What contract liability is imposed when a person signs commercial paper \n3. What warranty liability is imposed upon a transferor \n4. What happens if there is payment or acceptance by mistake \n5. How parties are discharged from liability on commercial paper \n \n \nIn Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial \nPaper\", and Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\", we focused on the methods and \nconsequences of negotiating commercial paper when all the proper steps are followed. For example, \na maker gives a negotiable note to a payee, who properly negotiates the paper to a third-party holder \nin due course. As a result, this third party is entitled to collect from the maker, unless the latter has a \nreal defense. \n \nIn this chapter, we begin by examining a question especially important to management: personal \nliability for signing company notes and checks. Then we look at the two general types of liability—\ncontract and warranty—introduced in Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". We conclude \nthe chapter by reviewing the ways in which parties are discharged from liability. \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n889 \n \n \n \n22.1 Liability Imposed by Signature: Agents, Authorized and \nUnauthorized \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Recognize what a signature is under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Understand how a person’s signature on an instrument affects liability if the person is an agent, or a \npurported agent, for another. \n \n \nThe liability of an agent who signs commercial paper is one of the most frequently litigated issues in this \narea of law. For example, Igor is an agent (treasurer) of Frank N. Stein, Inc. Igor signs a note showing that \nthe corporation has borrowed $50,000 from First Bank. The company later becomes bankrupt. The \nquestion: Is Igor personally liable on the note? The unhappy treasurer might be sued by the bank—the \nimmediate party with whom he dealt—or by a third party to whom the note was transferred (see Figure \n22.1 \"Signature by Representative\"). \n \nFigure 22.1 Signature by Representative \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n890 \n \nThere are two possibilities regarding an agent who signs commercial paper: the agent was authorized to \ndo so, or the agent was not authorized to do so. First, though, what is a signature? \n \nA “Signature” under the Uniform Commercial Code \nSection 3-401 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides fairly straightforwardly that “a signature \ncan be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name, including \nany trade or assumed name, or by any word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person with the \npresent intention to authenticate a writing.” \n \nLiability of an Agent Who Has Authority to Sign \nAgents often sign instruments on behalf of their principals, and—of course—because a corporation’s \nexistence is a legal fiction (you can’t go up and shake hands with General Motors), corporations can only \nact through their agents. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 3-402(a) of the UCC provides that a person acting (or purporting to act) as an agent who signs an \ninstrument binds the principal to the same extent that the principal would be bound if the signature were \non a simple contract. The drafters of the UCC here punt to the common law of agency: if, under agency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n891 \nlaw, the principal would be bound by the act of the agent, the signature is the authorized signature of the \nprincipal. And the general rule in agency law is that the agent is not liable if he signs his own name and \nmakes clear he is doing so as an agent. In our example, Igor should sign as follows: “Frank N. Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.”",

Farm Bureau then negotiated a $69,000 settlement with the Russells, issued them a \ncheck in this amount payable to them and Conseco jointly, and mailed the check to the Russells. Neither \nthe Russells nor Farm Bureau notified Conseco of the loss, the settlement, or the mailing of the check. \n \nThe check was drawn on Farm Bureau’s account at BNH. The Russells deposited the check into their \naccount at BOK. The check contains an endorsement by both Russells, and a rubber stamp endorsement \nfor Conseco followed by a signature of a Donna Marlatt and a phone number. It is undisputed that \nConseco’s endorsement was forged. Upon receipt, BOK presented the check to BNH. BNH paid the \n$69,000 check and notified Farm Bureau that the check had been paid from its account. \n \nAbout a year later, Conseco learned about the fire and the insurance payoff. Conseco notified Farm \nBureau that it was owed a mortgage balance of more than $50,000. Farm Bureau paid off the balance and \nnotified BNH of the forgery. BNH reimbursed Farm Bureau the amount paid to Conseco. BNH then sued \nBOK. \n \nBoth banks relied on the Uniform Commercial Code. BNH asserted that under § 4-208, BOK had \nwarranted that all the indorsements on the check were genuine. BOK asserted an affirmative defense \nunder § 3-406, alleging that Farm Bureau’s own negligence contributed to the forgery. After a non-jury \ntrial, the court granted judgment to BOK, finding as follows: \n \n• \nConseco’s endorsement was a forgery, accomplished by the Russells; \n• \nFarm Bureau was negligent in the manner and method it used to process the claim and pay the \nsettlement without providing any notice or opportunity for involvement in the process to \nConseco; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n914 \n• \nFarm Bureau’s negligence substantially contributed to the Russells’ conduct in forging Conseco’s \nendorsement; and \n• \nBOK proved its affirmative defense under § 3-406 by the greater weight of the evidence. \n \nFrom this judgment, BNH appeals. \n \nAnalysis \nIt cannot be disputed that BOK breached its presentment warranty to BNH under § 4-208. [1] Thus the \nprimary issue raised is whether BOK established a preclusion defense under 3-406 [that BNH is \nprecluded from complaining about BOK’s breach of presentment warranty because of its own \nnegligence]. [2] BNH asserts that the evidence fails to establish this defense because the mailing of its \ncheck to and receipt by the insured “is at most an event of opportunity and has nothing to do with the \nactual forgery.” \n \nSection 3-406 requires less stringent proof than the “direct and proximate cause” test for general \nnegligence. [3] Conduct is a contributing cause of an alteration or forgery if it is a substantial factor in \nbringing it about, or makes it “easier for the wrongdoer to commit his wrong.” The UCC Comment to § 3-\n406 notes that the term has the meaning as used by the Pennsylvania court in Thompson [Citation]. \n \nIn Thompson, an independent logger named Albers obtained blank weighing slips, filled them out to show \nfictitious deliveries of logs for local timber owners, delivered the slips to the company, accepted checks \nmade payable to the timber owners, forged the owners’ signatures, and cashed the checks at the bank. \nWhen the company discovered the scheme, it sued the bank and the bank raised § 3-406 as a defense. The \ncourt specifically found that the company’s negligence did not have to be the direct and proximate cause \nof the bank’s acceptance of the forged checks. Instead, the defense applied because the company left blank \nlogging slips readily accessible to haulers, the company had given Albers whole pads of blank slips, the \nslips were not consecutively numbered, haulers were allowed to deliver both the original and duplicate",

Although histories of banking dwell on the relationship between \nbanks and the national government, the banking law that governs the daily operation of checking \naccounts is state based—Article 4 of the UCC. The enormous increase in noncheck banking has given \nrise to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, a federal law. \n \n \n \n \n \n23.1 Banks and Their Customers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how checks move, both traditionally and electronically. \n2. Know how Article 4 governs the relationship between a bank and its customers. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n939 \n \n \nThe Traditional Bank Collection Process \nThe Traditional System in General \nOnce people mostly paid for things with cash: actual bills. That is obviously not very convenient or safe: a \nlost ten-dollar bill is almost certainly gone, and carrying around large quantities of cash is dangerous \n(probably only crooks do much of that). Today a person might go for weeks without reaching for a bill \n(except maybe to get change for coins to put in the parking meter). And while it is indisputable that \nelectronic payment is replacing paper payment, the latter is still very significant. Here is an excerpt from a \nFederal Reserve Report on the issue: \n \nIn 2008, U.S. consumers had more payment instruments to choose from than ever before: four \ntypes of paper instruments—cash, check, money order, and travelers checks; three types of \npayment cards—debit, credit, and prepaid; and two electronic instruments—online banking bill \npayment (OBBP) and electronic bank account deductions (EBAD) using their bank account \nnumbers. The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card. More consumers now have debit cards than credit cards (80.2 percent versus 78.3 \npercent), and consumers use debit cards more often than cash, credit cards, or checks \nindividually. However, paper instruments are still popular and account for 36.5 percent of \nconsumer payments. Most consumers have used newer electronic payments at some point, but \nthese only account for 9.7 percent of consumer payments. Security and ease of use are the \ncharacteristics of payment instruments that consumers rate as most important. [1] \n \nAmericans still wrote some thirty billion checks in 2006. [2] You can readily imagine how complex the \nbank collection process must be to cope with such a flood of paper. Every check written must eventually \ncome back to the bank on which it is drawn, after first having been sent to the landlord, say, to pay rent, \nthen to the landlord’s bank, and from there through a series of intermediate banks and collection centers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n940 \nTerminology \nTo trace the traditional check-collection process, it is necessary to understand the terminology used. The \nbank upon which a check is written is the payor bank (the drawee bank). The depository bank is the \none the payee deposits the check into. Two terms are used to describe the various banks that may handle \nthe check after it is written: collecting banks and intermediary banks. All banks that handle the check—\nexcept the payor bank—are collecting banks (including the depository \nbank); intermediary banks are all the collecting banks except the payor and depository banks. A bank \ncan take on more than one role: Roger in Seattle writes a check on his account at Seattle Bank and mails it \nto Julia in Los Angeles in payment for merchandise; Julia deposits it in her account at Bank of L.A. Bank \nof L.A. is a depository bank and a collecting bank. Any other bank through which the check travels (except \nthe two banks already mentioned) is an intermediary bank. \n \nCollection Process between Customers of the Same Bank \nIf the depository bank is also the payor bank (about 30% of all checks), the check is called an “on-us” item \nand UCC 4-215(e)(2) provides that—if the check is not dishonored—it is available by the payee “at the \nopening of the bank’s second banking day following receipt of the item.” Roger writes a check to Matthew, \nboth of whom have accounts at Seattle Bank; Matthew deposits the check on Monday. On Wednesday the \ncheck is good for Matthew (he may have been given “provisional credit” before then, as discussed below, \nthe bank could subtract the money from his account if Roger didn’t have enough to cover the check). \n \nCollection Process between Customers of Different Banks \nRoger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. Julia deposits it in her account at \nL.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank must somehow present the check to Seattle Bank either directly \nor through intermediary banks. If the collecting banks (again, all of them except Seattle Bank) act before",

Traditionally this has been a process of physical transfer by air and ground \ntransportation from the depository bank to various intermediary banks to the payor bank where the check is \npresented. Since 2004 the Check 21 Act has encouraged a trend away from the physical transportation of \nchecks to the electronic transportation of the check’s data, which is truncated (stripped) from the paper \ninstrument and transmitted. However, if a paper instrument is required, a “substitute check” will recreate it. \nThe UCC’s Article 4 deals generally with aspects of the bank-customer relationship, including warranties on \npayment or collection of checks, payment of overdrafts, stop orders, and customers’ duties to detect \nirregularities.

What has developed is electronic fund transfer (EFT), a system that has changed how customers \ninteract with banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Paper checks have their advantages, \nbut their use is decreasing in favor of EFT. \n \nIn simplest terms, EFT is a method of paying by substituting an electronic signal for checks. A “debit \ncard,” inserted in the appropriate terminal, will authorize automatically the transfer of funds from your \nchecking account, say, to the account of a store whose goods you are buying. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n951 \n \n \n \nTypes of EFT \nYou are of course familiar with some forms of EFT: \n \n• \nThe automated teller machine (ATM) permits you to electronically transfer funds between \nchecking and savings accounts at your bank with a plastic ID card and a personal identification \nnumber (PIN), and to obtain cash from the machine. \n• \nTelephone transfers or computerized transfers allow customers to access the bank’s computer \nsystem and direct it to pay bills owed to a third party or to transfer funds from one account to \nanother. \n• \nPoint of sale terminals located in stores let customers instantly debit their bank accounts and \ncredit the merchant’s account. \n• \nPreauthorized payment plans permit direct electronic deposit of paychecks, Social Security \nchecks, and dividend checks. \n• \nPreauthorized withdrawals from customers’ bank accounts or credit card accounts allow paperless",

Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce. Suppose the parties do not stipulate a body of law for the agreement, and the \nvarious bodies of law conflict, what then? Julius is in New York and Rochelle is in Paris; does French law \nor New York law govern? The answer will depend on the particulars of the dispute. An American court \nmust determine under the applicable principles of the law of “conflicts of law” whether New York or \nFrench law applies. \n \nDomestic Law \nThe principal body of law applicable to the letter of credit in the United States is Article 5 of the UCC. \nSection 5-103 declares that Article 5 “applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations \narising out of transactions involving letters of credit.” The Official Comment to 5-101 observes, “A letter of \ncredit is an idiosyncratic form of undertaking that supports performance of an obligation incurred in a \nseparate financial, mercantile, or other transaction or arrangement.” And—as is the case in other parts of \nthe Code—parties may, within some limits, agree to “variation by agreement in order to respond to and \naccommodate developments in custom and usage that are not inconsistent with the essential definitions \nand mandates of the statute.” Although detailed consideration of Article 5 is beyond the scope of this \nbook, a distinction between guarantees and letters of credit should be noted: Article 5 applies to the latter \nand not the former. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n962 \nLetters of Credit as Payment for Exports \nThe following discussion presents how letters of credit work as payment for exports, and a sample letter of \ncredit is presented at Figure 23.4 \"A Letter of Credit\". \n \nFigure 23.4 A Letter of Credit \n \nJulius desires to sell fine quality magic wands and other stage props to Rochelle’s Gallery in Paris. \nRochelle agrees to pay by letter of credit—she will, in effect, get her bank to inform Julius that he will get \npaid if the goods are right. She does so by “opening” a letter of credit at her bank—the issuing bank—the \nBanque de Rue de Houdini where she has funds in her account, or good credit. She tells the bank the \nterms of sale, the nature and quantity of the goods, the amount to be paid, the documents she will require \nas proof of shipment, and an expiration date. Banque de Rue de Houdini then directs its correspondent \nbank in the United States, First Excelsior Bank, to inform Julius that the letter of credit has been opened: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n963 \nRochelle is good for it. For Julius to have the strongest guarantee that he will be paid, Banque de Rou de \nHoudini can ask First Excelsior to confirm the letter of credit, thus binding both Banque de Rue de \nHoudini and Excelsior to pay according to the terms of the letter. \n \nOnce Julius is informed that the letter of credit has been issued and confirmed, he can proceed to ship the \ngoods and draw a draft to present (along with the required documents such as commercial invoice, bill of \nlading, and insurance policy) to First Excelsior, which is bound to follow exactly its instructions from \nBanque de Rue de Houdini. Julius can present the draft and documents directly, through correspondent \nbanks, or by a representative at the port from which he is shipping the goods. On presentation, First \nExcelsior may forward the documents to Banque de Rue de Houdini for approval and when First Excelsior \nis satisfied it will take the draft and pay Julius immediately on a sight draft or will stamp the draft \n“accepted” if it is a time draft (payable in thirty, sixty, or ninety days). Julius can discount an accepted \ntime draft or hold it until it matures and cash it in for the full amount. First Excelsior will then forward \nthe draft through international banking channels to Banque de Rue de Houdini to debit Rochelle’s \naccount. \n \nAs Payment for Imports \nUS importers—buyers—also can use the letter of credit to pay for goods bought from abroad. The \nimporter’s bank may require that the buyer put up collateral to guarantee it will be reimbursed for \npayment of the draft when it is presented by the seller’s agents. Since the letter of credit ordinarily will be \nirrevocable, the bank will be bound to pay the draft when presented (assuming the proper documents are \nattached), regardless of deficiencies ultimately found in the goods.

Whether Rogers’ Delay in Detecting the Forgeries Barred Suit against Union Planters. \n \nThe relationship between Rogers and Union Planters is governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial \nCode. [UCC] 4-406(a) and (c) provide that a bank customer has a duty to discover and report \n“unauthorized signatures”; i.e., forgeries. [The section] reflects an underlying policy decision that furthers \nthe UCC’s “objective of promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.” The UCC \nfacilitates financial transactions, benefiting both consumers and financial institutions, by allocating \nresponsibility among the parties according to whomever is best able to prevent a loss. Because the \ncustomer is more familiar with his own signature, and should know whether or not he authorized a \nparticular withdrawal or check, he can prevent further unauthorized activity better than a financial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n973 \ninstitution which may process thousands of transactions in a single day.…The customer’s duty to exercise \nthis care is triggered when the bank satisfies its burden to provide sufficient information to the customer. \nAs a result, if the bank provides sufficient information, the customer bears the loss when he fails to detect \nand notify the bank about unauthorized transactions. [Citation] \n \nA. Union Planters’ Duty to Provide Information under 4-406(a). \nThe court admitted into evidence copies of all Union Planters statements sent to Rogers during the \nrelevant time period. Enclosed with the bank statements were either the cancelled checks themselves or \ncopies of the checks relating to the period of time of each statement. The evidence shows that all bank \nstatements and cancelled checks were sent, via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at \ntheir “designated address” each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary. We therefore find \nthat the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers and that the remaining \nprovisions of 4-406 are applicable to the case at bar.… \nIn defense of her failure to inspect the bank statements, Rogers claims that she never received the bank \nstatements and cancelled checks. Even if this allegation is true, [2] it does not excuse Rogers from failing to \nfulfill her duties under 4-406(a) & (c) because the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in \nproviding the necessary information to a customer when it “sends…to a customer a statement of account \nshowing payment of items.”…The word “receive” is absent. The customer’s duty to inspect and report does \nnot arise when the statement is received, as Rogers claims; the customer’s duty to inspect and report \narises when the bank sends the statement to the customer’s address. A reasonable person who has not \nreceived a monthly statement from the bank would promptly ask the bank for a copy of the statement. \nHere, Rogers claims that she did not receive numerous statements. We find that she failed to act \nreasonably when she failed to take any action to replace the missing statements. \n \nB. Rogers’ Duty to Report the Forgeries under 4-406(d). \n[Under UCC 4-406] a customer who has not promptly notified a bank of an irregularity may be precluded \nfrom bringing certain claims against the bank: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n974 \n“(d) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties \nimposed on the customer by subsection (c), the customer is precluded from asserting against the \nbank: \n(1) The customer’s unauthorized signature…on the item,… \n \nAlso, when there is a series of forgeries, 406(d)(2) places additional duties on the customer, [who is \nprecluded from asserting against the bank]: \n \n(2) The customer’s unauthorized signature…by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in \ngood faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the \ncustomer of the unauthorized signature…and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable \nperiod of time, not exceeding thirty (30) days, in which to examine the item or statement of \naccount and notify the bank. \nAlthough there is no mention of a specific date, Rogers testified that she and her son began looking for the \nstatements in late May or early June of 2001, after her husband had died.…When they discovered that \nstatements were missing, they notified Union Planters in June of 2001 to replace the statements. At this \ntime, no mention of possible forgery was made, even though Neal, Jr., thought that “something was \nwrong.” In fact, Neal, Jr., had felt that something was wrong as far back as December of 2000, but failed \nto do anything. Neal, Jr., testified that neither he nor his mother knew that Reese had been forging checks \nuntil September of 2001.

The first charge was $501.75 on January 13, 2005.…Brown asserts at trial that she \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n977 \ntherefore timely gave notice to Commerce to investigate and requested Commerce to close the debit \nchecking account on January 16, 2005. \n \nAt trial Brown also testified she “never heard” from Commerce again until she received a letter in \nDecember 2005 citing a $4,000.00 deficiency balance.… \n \nOn cross-examination Brown testified she received a PIN number from Commerce and “gave the PIN \nnumber to no other person.” In December 2004 she resided with Charles Williams, who is now her \nhusband. Brown testified on cross-examination that she was the only person authorized as a PIN user and \nno one else knew of the card, ‘used the card,’ or was provided orally or in writing of the PIN number. \nBrown spoke with Carla Bernard at the Commerce Bank at the Talleyville branch. Although Brown did not \ninitially fill out a formal report, she did visit Commerce on January 16, 2005 the Talleyville branch and \nchanged her address with Carla. Brown does not recall the last time she ever received a statement from \nCommerce Bank on her checking account. Brown made no further purchases with the account and she \nwas unaware of all the “incidents of unauthorized debit charges on her checking account” until she was \nactually sued by Commerce Bank in the Court of Common Pleas. \n \nIII.

Because \ncredit is such a big business, a number of support industries have grown up around it. One of the most \nimportant is the credit-reporting industry, which addresses this issue of checking creditworthiness. \nCertain companies—credit bureaus—collect information about borrowers, holders of credit cards, store \naccounts, and installment purchasers. For a fee, this information—currently held on tens of millions of \nAmericans—is sold to companies anxious to know whether applicants are creditworthy. If the information \nis inaccurate, it can lead to rejection of a credit application that should be approved, and it can wind up in \nother files where it can live to do more damage. In 1970, Congress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to give consumers access to their credit files in order \nto correct errors. \n \nUnder this statute, an applicant denied credit has the right to be told the name and address of the credit \nbureau (called “consumer reporting agency” in the act) that prepared the report on which the denial was \nbased. (The law covers reports used to screen insurance and job applicants as well as to determine \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n995 \ncreditworthiness.) The agency must list the nature and substance of the information (except medical \ninformation) and its sources (unless they contributed to an investigative-type report). A credit report lists \nsuch information as name, address, employer, salary history, loans outstanding, and the like. An \ninvestigative-type report is one that results from personal interviews and may contain nonfinancial \ninformation, like drinking and other personal habits, character, or participation in dangerous sports. \nSince the investigators rely on talks with neighbors and coworkers, their reports are usually subjective and \ncan often be misleading and inaccurate. \n \nThe agency must furnish the consumer the information free if requested within thirty days of rejection \nand must also specify the name and address of anyone who has received the report within the preceding \nsix months (two years if furnished for employment purposes). \n \nIf the information turns out to be inaccurate, the agency must correct its records; if investigative material \ncannot be verified, it must be removed from the file. Those to whom it was distributed must be notified of \nthe changes. When the agency and the consumer disagree about the validity of the information, the \nconsumer’s version must be placed in the file and included in future distributions of the report. After \nseven years, any adverse information must be removed (ten years in the case of bankruptcy). A person is \nentitled to one free copy of his or her credit report from each of the three main national credit bureaus \nevery twelve months. If a reporting agency fails to correct inaccurate information in a reasonable time, it \nis liable to the consumer for $1,000 plus attorneys’ fees. \n \nUnder the FCRA, any person who obtains information from a credit agency under false pretenses is \nsubject to criminal and civil penalties. The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. See Rodgers \nv. McCullough inSection 24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving use of information from a credit report. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCredit is an important part of the US economy, and there are various laws regulating its availability and \ndisclosure. Usury laws prohibit charging excessive interest rates, though the laws are riddled with exceptions. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n996 \nThe disclosure of credit costs is regulated by the Truth in Lending Act of 1969, the Consumer Leasing Act of \n1988, the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1989, and the Credit Card Accountability, \nResponsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (these latter three are amendments to the TILA). Some states have \nadopted the Uniform Consumer Credit Code as well. Two major laws prohibit invidious discrimination in the \ngranting of credit: the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 \n(addressing the problem of redlining).

The Court will address the FCRA claims followed by the state law claim for \nunlawful invasion of privacy. \n \nA. Permissible Purpose under the FCRA \nPursuant to the FCRA, “A person shall not use or obtain a consumer report for any purpose unless (1) the \nconsumer report is obtained for a purpose for which the consumer report is authorized to be furnished \nunder this section.…” [Citation.] Defendants do not dispute that Ms. McCullough obtained and used Ms. \nRodgers’ consumer report. \n \n[The act] provides a list of permissible purposes for the receipt and use of a consumer report, of which the \nfollowing subsection is at issue in this case: \n \n[A]ny consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and \nno other:… \n \n(3) To a person which it has reason to believe- \n(A) intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer \non whom the information is to be furnished and involving the extension of credit to, or review or \ncollection of an account of, the consumer… \n[Citation.] Defendants concede that Ms. McCullough’s receipt and use of Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report \ndoes not fall within any of the other permissible purposes enumerated in [the act]. \n \nMs. Rodgers requests summary judgment in her favor on this point, relying on the plain text of the \nstatute, because she was not in arrears on any child support obligation at the time Ms. McCullough \nrequested the consumer report, nor did she owe Ms. McCullough’s client any debt. She notes that Mr. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1011 \nAnthony did not have custody of Meghan Rodgers and that an award of child support had not even been \nset at the time Ms. McCullough obtained her consumer report. \n \nDefendants maintain that Ms. McCullough obtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report for a permissible \npurpose, namely to locate Ms. Rodgers’ residence and set and collect child support obligations. \nDefendants argue that 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(a)(3)(A) permits the use of a credit report in connection with \n“collection of an account” and, therefore, Ms. McCullough was permitted to use Ms. Rodgers’ credit report \nin connection with the collection of child support. [1] \n \nThe cases Defendants have cited in response to the motion for summary judgment are inapplicable to the \npresent facts. In each case cited by Defendants, the person who obtained a credit report did so in order to \ncollect on an outstanding judgment or an outstanding debt. See, e.g., [Citation] (finding that collection of \na judgment of arrears in child support is a permissible purpose under [the act]; [Citation] (holding that \ndefendant had a permissible purpose for obtaining a consumer report where plaintiff owed an \noutstanding debt to the company). \n \nHowever, no such outstanding debt or judgment existed in this case. At the time Ms. McCullough \nobtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report, Ms. Rodgers’ did not owe money to either Ms. McCullough or her \nclient, Mr. Anthony. Defendants have provided no evidence showing that Ms. McCullough believed Ms. \nRodgers owed money to Mr. Anthony at the time she requested the credit report. Indeed, Mr. Anthony \nhad not even been awarded custody of Meghan Rodgers at the time Ms. McCullough obtained and used \nthe credit report. Ms. McCullough acknowledged each of the facts during her deposition. Moreover, in \nresponse to Plaintiff’s request for admissions, Ms. McCullough admitted that she did not receive the credit \nreport for the purpose of collecting on an account from Ms. Rodgers. \n \nThe evidence before the Court makes clear that Ms. McCullough was actually attempting, on behalf of Mr. \nAnthony, to secure custody of Meghan Rodgers and obtain a future award of child support payments from \nMs. Rodgers by portraying Ms. Rodgers as irresponsible to the court. These are not listed as permissible \npurposes under [FCRA]. Defendants have offered the Court no reason to depart from the plain language \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1012 \nof the statute, which clearly does not permit an individual to obtain a consumer report for the purposes of \nobtaining child custody and instituting child support payments. Moreover, the fact that the Juvenile Court \nlater awarded custody and child support to Mr. Anthony does not retroactively provide Ms. McCullough \nwith a permissible purpose for obtaining Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report. Therefore, the Court GRANTS \nPlaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment on the question of whether Defendants had a permissible \npurpose to obtain Ms. Rodgers’ credit report. \n \nB.

In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, \nyou’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might \nmake: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you \ndefault), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet \nring. Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the \nparticular goods purchased. A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book. \nWhether a transaction is a lease or a PMSI is an issue that frequently arises. The answer depends on the \nfacts of each case. However, a security interest is created if (1) the lessee is obligated to continue payments \nfor the term of the lease; (2) the lessee cannot terminate the obligation; and (3) one of several economic \ntests, which are listed in UCC Section 1-201 (37), is met. For example, one of the economic tests is that \n“the lessee has an option to become owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal \nadditional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.” \n \nThe issue of lease versus security interest gets litigated because of the requirements of Article 9 that a \nsecurity interest be perfected in certain ways (as we will see). If the transaction turns out to be a security \ninterest, a lessor who fails to meet these requirements runs the risk of losing his property to a third party. \nAnd consider this example. Ferrous Brothers Iron Works “leases” a $25,000 punch press to Millie’s \nMachine Shop. Under the terms of the lease, Millie’s must pay a yearly rental of $5,000 for five years, \nafter which time Millie’s may take title to the machine outright for the payment of $1. During the period of \nthe rental, title remains in Ferrous Brothers. Is this “lease” really a security interest? Since ownership \ncomes at nominal charge when the entire lease is satisfied, the transaction would be construed as one \ncreating a security interest. What difference does this make? Suppose Millie’s goes bankrupt in the third \nyear of the lease, and the trustee in bankruptcy wishes to sell the punch press to satisfy debts of the \nmachine shop. If it were a true lease, Ferrous Brothers would be entitled to reclaim the machine (unless \nthe trustee assumed the lease). But if the lease is really intended as a device to create a security interest, \nthen Ferrous Brothers can recover its collateral only if it has otherwise complied with the obligations of \nArticle 9—for example, by recording its security interest, as we will see. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1023 \nNow we return to definitions. \n \nDebtor is “a person (1) having an interest in the collateral other than a security interest or a lien; (2) a \nseller of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; or (3) a consignee.” [4] \nObligor is “a person that, with respect to an obligation secured by a security interest in or an agricultural \nlien on the collateral, (i) owes payment or other performance of the obligation, (ii) has provided property \nother than the collateral to secure payment or other performance of the obligation, or (iii) is otherwise \naccountable in whole or in part for payment or other performance of the obligation.” [5] Here is example 1 \nfrom the Official Comment to UCC Section 9-102: “Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security \ninterest in her Miata to secure the debt. Behnfeldt is a debtor and an obligor.” \n \nBehnfeldt is a debtor because she has an interest in the car—she owns it. She is an obligor because she \nowes payment to the creditor. Usually the debtor is the obligor. \n \nA secondary obligor is “an obligor to the extent that: (A) [the] obligation is secondary; or (b) [the person] \nhas a right of recourse with respect to an obligation secured by collateral against the debtor, another \nobligor, or property of either.” [6] The secondary obligor is a guarantor (surety) of the debt, obligated to \nperform if the primary obligor defaults. Consider example 2 from the Official Comment to Section 9-102: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security interest in her Miata to secure the debt. Bruno cosigns a \nnegotiable note as maker. As before, Behnfeldt is the debtor and an obligor. As an accommodation party, \nBruno is a secondary obligor. Bruno has this status even if the note states that her obligation is a primary \nobligation and that she waives all suretyship defenses.” \n \nAgain, usually the debtor is the obligor, but consider example 3 from the same Official Comment: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money on an unsecured basis. Bruno cosigns the note and grants a security interest in \nher Honda to secure her [Behnfeldt’s] obligation. Inasmuch as Behnfeldt does not have a property interest",

[16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse \nreceipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the \nvalue. For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a \nsecurity interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse. If Deborah \ndefaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is \nentitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation. The warehouser will not let Carl have the \nchairs without the warehouse receipt—it’s indispensable paper. There are four kinds of indispensable \npaper. \n \nChattel Paper \nChattel is another word for goods. Chattel paper is a record (paper or electronic) that demonstrates both \n“a monetary obligation and a security interest either in certain goods or in a lease on certain \ngoods.” [17] The paper represents a valuable asset and can itself be used as collateral. For example, Creditor \nCar Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a \npurchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper). The chattel paper \nis not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from \nLift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to \nLift Co. The chattel paper is now collateral. Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic. \n \nDocuments \nThis category includes documents of title—bills of lading and warehouse receipts are examples. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1027 \n \nInstruments \nAn “instrument” here is “a negotiable instrument (checks, drafts, notes, certificates of deposit) or any \nother writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary obligation, is not itself a security \nagreement or lease, and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with \nany necessary indorsement or assignment.” “Instrument” does not include (i) investment property, (ii) \nletters of credit, or (iii) writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or \ncharge card or information contained on or for use with the card. [18] \n \nInvestment Property \nThis includes securities (stock, bonds), security accounts, commodity accounts, and commodity \ncontracts. [19] Securities may be certified (represented by a certificate) or uncertified (not represented by a \ncertificate).[20] \n \nOther Types of Collateral \nAmong possible other types of collateral that may be used as security is the floating lien. This is a \nsecurity interest in property that was not in the possession of the debtor when the security agreement was \nexecuted. The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and \nproceeds held by—most often—the business debtor. It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell \ntheir collateralized inventory. Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily \ndepleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers. Pretty soon, there’d be no security \nat all. The floating lien includes the following: \n• \nAfter-acquired property. This is property that the debtor acquires after the original deal was set \nup. It allows the secured party to enhance his security as the debtor (obligor) acquires more \nproperty subject to collateralization. \n• \nSale proceeds. These are proceeds from the disposition of the collateral. Carl Creditor takes a \nsecured interest in Deborah Debtor’s sailboat. She sells the boat and buys a garden tractor. The \nsecured interest attaches to the garden tractor. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1028 \n• \nFuture advances. Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause. The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a \n$700,000 inventory-picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor.

Some firms advertise that they have 360-\ndegree video cameras that record every aspect of the repossession. They have “skip chasers”—people \nwhose business it is to track down those who skip out on their obligations, and they are trained not to \nbreach the peace. [1] See Pantoja-Cahue v. Ford Motor Credit Co., a case discussing repossession, \nin Section 25.5 \"Cases\". \nThe reference in Section 9-609(a)(2) to “render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a \ndebtor’s premises” gets to situations involving “heavy equipment [when] the physical removal from the \ndebtor’s plant and the storage of collateral pending disposition may be impractical or unduly \nexpensive.…Of course…all aspects of the disposition must be commercially reasonable.” [2]Rendering the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1050 \nequipment unusable would mean disassembling some critical part of the machine—letting it sit there until \nan auction is set up on the premises. \n \nThe creditor’s agents—the repo people—charge for their service, of course, and if possible the cost of \nrepossession comes out of the collateral when it’s sold. A debtor would be better off voluntarily delivering \nthe collateral according to the creditor’s instructions, but if that doesn’t happen, “self-help”—\nrepossession—is allowed because, of course, the debtor said it would be allowed in the security agreement, \nso long as the repossession can be accomplished without breach of peace. “Breach of peace” is language \nthat can cover a wide variety of situations over which courts do not always agree. For example, some \ncourts interpret a creditor’s taking of the collateral despite the debtor’s clear oral protest as a breach of the \npeace; other courts do not. \n \nDisposition after Repossession \nAfter repossession, the creditor has two options: sell the collateral or accept it in satisfaction of the debt \n(see Figure 25.5 \"Disposition after Repossession\"). \n \nFigure 25.5 Disposition after Repossession \n \nSale \nSale is the usual method of recovering the debt.

Two requirements limit the creditor’s power to resell: (1) it must \nsend notice to the debtor and secondary obligor, and (unless consumer goods are sold) to other secured \nparties; and (2) all aspects of the sale must be “commercially reasonable.” [3] Most frequently the collateral \nis auctioned off. \n \nSection 9-615 of the UCC describes how the proceeds are applied: first, to the costs of the repossession, \nincluding reasonable attorney’s fees and legal expenses as provided for in the security agreement (and it \nwill provide for that!); second, to the satisfaction of the obligation owed; and third, to junior creditors. \nThis again emphasizes the importance of promptly perfecting the security interest: failure to do so \nfrequently subordinates the tardy creditor’s interest to junior status. If there is money left over from \ndisposing of the collateral—a surplus—the debtor gets that back. If there is still money owing—a \ndeficiency—the debtor is liable for that. In Section 9-616, the UCC carefully explains how the surplus or \ndeficiency is calculated; the explanation is required in a consumer goods transaction, and it has to be sent \nto the debtor after the disposition. \n \nStrict Foreclosure \nBecause resale can be a bother (or the collateral is appreciating in value), the secured creditor may wish \nsimply to accept the collateral in full satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the debt, as permitted in UCC \nSection 9-620(a). This is known as strict foreclosure. The debtor must consent to letting the creditor \ntake the collateral without a sale in a “record authenticated after default,” or after default the creditor can \nsend the debtor a proposal for the creditor to accept the collateral, and the proposal is effective if not \nobjected to within twenty days after it’s sent. \n \nThe strict foreclosure provisions contain a safety feature for consumer goods debtors. If the debtor has \npaid at least 60 percent of the debt, then the creditor may not use strict foreclosure—unless the debtor \nsigns a statement after default renouncing his right to bar strict foreclosure and to force a sale. [4] A \nconsumer who refuses to sign such a statement thus forces the secured creditor to sell the collateral under \nSection 9-610. Should the creditor fail to sell the goods within ninety days after taking possession of the",

Currin told Sheth that the notice indicated the sale was to be at the Third \nAvenue entrance, and that the sale had been held at the correct location. Sheth did not ask to re-open the \nbidding.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1113 \nSheth filed the current lawsuit, with Alpha as the sole plaintiff, on February 14, 2003. The lawsuit asked \nfor declaratory relief, restitution, and other damages. The trial court granted the defendants’ summary \njudgment motion on August 8, 2003. Alpha appeals. \n \nLocation of the Sale \n \nAlpha argues that the sale was improper because it was at the Third Avenue entrance, not the \nAdministration Building. Alpha points to a letter from a King County employee stating that auctions are \nheld at the Administration Building. The letter also stated that personnel were instructed to direct bidders \nand trustees to that location if asked. In addition, Alpha argues that the Third Avenue entrance was not a \n‘public’ place, as required by [the statute], since auction sales were forbidden there. We disagree. Alpha \nhas not shown that the Third Avenue entrance was an improper location. The evidence shows that the \ncounty had changed its policy as to where auctions would be held and had posted signs to that effect. \nHowever, the county did not exclude people from the Third Avenue entrance or prevent auctions from \nbeing held there. Street, who frequented sales, stated that auctions were being held in both locations. The \nsale was held where the Notice of Sale indicated it would be. In addition, Alpha has not introduced any \nevidence to show that the Third Avenue entrance was not a public place at the time of the sale. The public \nwas free to come and go at that location, and the area was ‘open and available for all to use.’ Alpha relies \non Morton v. Resolution Trust (S.D. Miss. 1995) to support its contention that the venue of the sale was \nimproper. [But] Morton is not on point. \n \nDuty to Re-Open Sale \nAlpha argues that Currin should have re-opened the sale. However, it is undisputed that Sheth did not \nrequest that Currin re-open it. The evidence indicates that Currin may have known about Sheth’s interest \nin bidding prior to the day of the sale, due to a conversation with Sheth’s attorney about Sheth’s desire to \nprotect his interest in the Property. But, this knowledge did not create in Currin any affirmative duty to \noffer to re-open the sale. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1114 \nIn addition, Alpha cites no Washington authority to support the contention that Currin would have been \nobligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked him to. The decision to continue a sale appears to be fully \nwithin the discretion of the trustee: “[t]he trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, \ncontinue the sale.” [Citation.] Alpha’s citation to Peterson v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., Missouri (1936) to \nsupport its contention that Currin should have re-opened the sale is unavailing. In Peterson, the Notice of \nSale indicated that the sale would be held at the ‘front’ door of the courthouse. But, the courthouse had \nfour doors, and the customary door for sales was the east door. The sheriff, acting as the trustee, \nconducted the sale at the east door, and then re-opened the sale at the south door, as there had been some \nsales at the south door. Alpha contends this shows that Currin should have re-opened the sale when \nlearning of the Administration Building location, akin to what the sheriff did in Peterson. However, \nPeterson does not indicate that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to re-sell the property at the south \ndoor. This case is not on point. \n \nChilled Bidding \nAlpha contends that Currin chilled the bidding on the Property by telling bidders that he expected a full \ncredit sale price and by holding the sale at the courthouse. Chilled bidding can be grounds for setting \naside a sale. Country Express Stores, Inc. v. Sims, [Washington Court of Appeals] (1997). TheCountry \nExpress court explained the two types of chilled bidding: \n \nThe first is intentional, occurring where there is collusion for the purpose of holding down the bids. The \nsecond consists of inadvertent and unintentional acts by the trustee that have the effect of suppressing the \nbidding. To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent. Additionally, Currin’s statement to [an interested person who",

The 2005 act—preceded by “massive lobbying largely by banks and credit card companies” [1]—\nwas intended by its promoters to restore personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system. \nThe law’s critics said it was simply a way for the credit card industry to extract more money from \nconsumers before their debts were wiped away. \n \nFigure 27.1 US Bankruptcies, 1980–2009 \n \nBankruptcy Action.com,http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/USbankstats.htm, statistics from \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. \n \nBankruptcy Courts, Judges, and Costs \nEach federal judicial district has a US Bankruptcy Court, whose judges are appointed by US Courts of \nAppeal. Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases. Chapter 5, “Creditors, the \nDebtor, and the Estate,” deals with the debtor’s “estate”—his or her assets. It lays down ground rules for",

Claims made by gap creditors in an involuntary bankruptcy petition under \nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 are those that arise between the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy \npetition and the order for relief issued by the court. These claims are given priority because \notherwise creditors would not deal with the debtor, usually a business, when the business has \ndeclared bankruptcy but no trustee has been appointed and no order of relief issued. \n \n(4) Employee wages up to $10,950 for each worker, for the 180 days previous to either the \nbankruptcy filing or when the business ceased operations, whichever is earlier (180-day period). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1133 \n \n(5) Unpaid contributions to employee benefit plans during the 180-day period, but limited by \nwhat was already paid by the employer under subsection (4) above plus what was paid on behalf \nof the employees by the bankruptcy estate for any employment benefit plan. \n(6) Any claims for grain from a grain producer or fish from a fishermanfor up to $5,400 each \nagainst a storage or processing facility. \n \n(7) Consumer layaway deposits of up to $2,425 each. \n \n(8) Taxes owing to federal, state, and local governments for income, property, employment and \nexcise taxes. Outside of bankruptcy, taxes usually have a higher priority than this, which is why \nmany times creditors—not tax creditors—file an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the \ndebtor so that they have a higher priority in bankruptcy than they would outside it. \n \n(9) Allowed claims based on any commitment by the debtor to a federal depository institution to \nmaintain the capital of an insured depository institution. \n \n(10) Claims for death or personal injury from a motor vehicle or vessel that occurred while the \ndebtor was legally intoxicated. \n \nThird through sixth (after secured creditors and priority claimants), other claimants are attended to, but \nnot immediately. The bankruptcy code (perhaps somewhat awkwardly) deals with who gets paid when in \nmore than one place. Chapter 5 sets out priority claims as just noted; that order applies \nto allbankruptcies. Chapter 7, dealing with liquidation (as opposed to Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, wherein \nthe debtor pays most of her debt), then lists the order ofdistribution. Section 726 of 11 United States Code \nprovides: “Distribution of property of the estate. (1) First, in payment of claims of the kind specified in, \nand in the order specified in section 507…” (again, the priority of claims just set out). Following the order \nspecified in the bankruptcy code, our discussion of the order of distribution is taken up in Section 27.3 \n\"Chapter 7 Liquidation\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1134 \n \n \n \nDebtor's Duties and Exemptions \nThe act imposes certain duties on the debtor, and it exempts some property that the trustee can \naccumulate and distribute from the estate. \n \nDebtor’s Duties \nThe debtor, reasonably enough, is supposed to file a list of creditors, assets, liabilities, and current \nincome, and a statement of financial affairs. The debtor must cooperate with the trustee and be an “honest \ndebtor” in general; the failure to abide by these duties is grounds for a denial of discharge. \n \nThe individual debtor (not including partnerships or corporations) also must show evidence that he or she \nattended an approved nonprofit budget and counseling agency within 180 days before the filing. The \ncounseling may be “an individual or group briefing (including a briefing conducted by telephone or on the \nInternet) that outline[s] the opportunities for available credit counseling and assisted such individual in \nperforming a related budget analysis.” [1] In Section 111, the 2005 act describes who can perform this \ncounseling, and a host of regulations and enforcement mechanisms are instituted, generally applying to \npersons who provide goods or services related to bankruptcy work for consumer debtors whose \nnonexempt assets are less than $150,000, in order to improve the professionalism of attorneys and others \nwho work with debtors in, or contemplating, bankruptcy. A debtor who is incapacitated, disabled, or on \nactive duty in a military zone doesn’t have to go through the counseling. \n \nDebtor’s Exemptions \nThe bankruptcy act exempts certain property of the estate of an individual debtor so that he or she will not \nbe impoverished upon discharge. Exactly what is exempt depends on state law. \n \nNotwithstanding the Constitution’s mandate that Congress establish “uniform laws on the subject of \nbankruptcies,” bankruptcy law is in fact not uniform because the states persuaded Congress to allow \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1135 \nnonuniform exemptions.

The concept makes sense: what is necessary for a debtor in Maine to live a \nnonimpoverished postbankruptcy life might not be the same as what is necessary in southern California. \nThe bankruptcy code describes how a person’s residence is determined for claiming state exemptions: \nbasically, where the debtor lived for 730 days immediately before filing or where she lived for 180 days \nimmediately preceding the 730-day period. For example, if the debtor resided in the same state, without \ninterruption, in the two years leading up to the bankruptcy, he can use that state’s exemptions. If not, the \nlocation where he resided for a majority of the half-year preceding the initial two years will be used. The \npoint here is to reduce “exemption shopping”—to reduce the incidences in which a person moves to a \ngenerous exemption state only to declare bankruptcy there. \n \nUnless the state has opted out of the federal exemptions (a majority have), a debtor can choose which \nexemptions to claim. [2] There are also some exemptions not included in the bankruptcy code: veteran’s, \nSocial Security, unemployment, and disability benefits are outside the code, and alimony payments are \nalso exempt under federal law. The federal exemptions can be doubled by a married couple filing together. \n \nHere are the federal exemptions: [3] \n \nHomestead: \n• \nReal property, including mobile homes and co-ops, or burial plots up to $20,200. Unused \nportion of homestead, up to $10,125, may be used for other property. \n \nPersonal Property: \n• \nMotor vehicle up to $3,225. \n• \nAnimals, crops, clothing, appliances and furnishings, books, household goods, and musical \ninstruments up to $525 per item, and up to $10,775 total. \n• \nJewelry up to $1,350. \n• \n$1,075 of any property, and unused portion of homestead up to $10,125. \n• \nHealth aids. \n• \nWrongful death recovery for person you depended upon. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1136 \n• \nPersonal injury recovery up to $20,200 except for pain and suffering or for pecuniary loss. \n• \nLost earnings payments. \n \nPensions: \n• \nTax exempt retirement accounts; IRAs and Roth IRAs up to $1,095,000 per person. \n \nPublic Benefits: \n• \nPublic assistance, Social Security, Veteran’s benefits, Unemployment Compensation. \n• \nCrime victim’s compensation. \n \nTools of Trade: \n• \nImplements, books, and tools of trade, up to $2,025. \n \nAlimony and Child Support: \n• \nAlimony and child support needed for support. \n \nInsurance: \n• \nUnmatured life insurance policy except credit insurance. \n• \nLife insurance policy with loan value up to $10,775. \n• \nDisability, unemployment, or illness benefits. \n• \nLife insurance payments for a person you depended on, which you need for support. \n \nIn the run-up to the 2005 changes in the bankruptcy law, there was concern that some states—especially \nFlorida [4]—had gone too far in giving debtors’ exemptions. The BAPCPA amended Section 522 to limit the \namount of equity a debtor can exempt, even in a state with unlimited homestead exemptions, in certain \ncircumstances. (Section 522(o) and (p) set out the law’s changes.) \n \nSecured Property \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1137 \nAs already noted, secured creditors generally have priority, even above the priority claims. That’s why \nbanks and lending institutions almost always secure the debtor’s obligations. But despite the general rule, \nthe debtor can avoid certain types of security interests. Liens that attach to assets that the debtor is \nentitled to claim as exempt can be avoided to the extent the lien impairs the value of the exemption in \nboth Chapter 13 and Chapter 7. To be avoidable, the lien must be a judicial lien (like a judgment or a \ngarnishment), or a nonpossessory, non-purchase-money security interest in household goods or tools of \nthe trade. \n \nTax liens (which are statutory liens, not judicial liens) aren’t avoidable in Chapter 7 even if they impair \nexemptions; tax liens can be avoided in Chapter 13 to the extent the lien is greater than the asset’s value. \n \nDischargeable and Nondischargeable Debts \nThe whole point of bankruptcy, of course, is for debtors to get relief from the press of debt that they \ncannot reasonably pay. \n \nDischargeable Debts \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable to pay any remaining unpaid debts (except \nnondischargeable debts) that arose before the court issued the order of relief.

The attorney for the \ndebtor must file an affidavit certifying that the agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary \nagreement, that the agreement does not impose an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent of the \ndebtor, and that the attorney has fully advised the debtor of the legal consequences of the agreement and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1139 \nof a default under the agreement. Where the debtor is an individual who was not represented by an \nattorney during the course of negotiating the agreement, the reaffirmation agreement must be approved \nby the court, after disclosures to the debtor, and after the court finds that it is in the best interest of the \ndebtor and does not cause an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent. \n \nProperty Included in the Estate \nWhen a bankruptcy petition is filed, a debtor’s estate is created consisting of all the debtor’s then-\nexisting property interests, whether legal or equitable. In addition, the estate includes any bequests, \ninheritances, and certain other distributions of property that the debtor receives within the next 180 days. \nIt also includes property recovered by the trustee under certain powers granted by the law. What is not \nexempt property will be distributed to the creditors. \n \nThe bankruptcy code confers on the trustee certain powers to recover property for the estate that the \ndebtor transferred before bankruptcy. \n \nOne such power (in Section 544) is to act as a hypothetical lien creditor. This power is best explained \nby an example. Suppose Dennis Debtor purchases equipment on credit from Acme Supply Company. \nAcme fails to perfect its security interest, and a few weeks later Debtor files a bankruptcy petition. By \nvirtue of the section conferring on the trustee the status of a hypothetical lien creditor, the trustee can act \nas though she had a lien on the equipment, with priority over Acme’s unperfected security interest. Thus \nthe trustee can avoid Acme’s security interest, with the result that Acme would be treated as an unsecured \ncreditor. \n \nAnother power is to avoid transactions known as voidable preferences—transactions highly favorable",

Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 11 bankruptcies. \n2. Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 13 bankruptcies. \n \n \nReorganization: Chapter 11 Bankruptcy \nOverview \nChapter 11 provides a means by which corporations, partnerships, and other businesses, including sole \nproprietorships, can rehabilitate themselves and continue to operate free from the burden of debts that \nthey cannot pay. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1149 \n \nIt is simple enough to apply for the protection of the court in Chapter 11 proceeding, and for many years, \nlarge financially ailing companies have sought shelter in Chapter 11. Well-known examples include \nGeneral Motors, Texaco, K-Mart, Delta Airlines, and Northwest Airlines. An increasing number of \ncorporations have turned to Chapter 11 even though, by conventional terms, they were solvent. Doing so \nenables them to negotiate with creditors to reduce debt. It also may even permit courts to snuff out \nlawsuits that have not yet been filed. Chapters 3 and 5, discussed in Section 27.2 \"Case Administration; \nCreditors’ Claims; Debtors’ Exemptions and Dischargeable Debts; Debtor’s Estate\", apply to Chapter 11 \nproceedings also. Our discussion, therefore, is limited to special features of Chapter 11. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nAny person eligible for discharge in Chapter 7 proceeding (plus railroads) is eligible for a Chapter 11 \nproceeding, except stockbrokers and commodity brokers. Individuals filing Chapter 11 must take credit \ncounseling; businesses do not. A company may voluntarily enter Chapter 11 or may be put there \ninvoluntarily by creditors. Individuals can file Chapter 11 particularly if they have too much debt to qualify \nfor Chapter 13 and make too much money to qualify for Chapter 7; under the 2005 act, individuals must \ncommit future wages to creditors, just as in Chapter 13. [1] \n \nOperation of Business \nUnless a trustee is appointed, the debtor will retain possession of the business and may continue to \noperate with its own management. The court may appoint a trustee on request of any party in interest \nafter notice and a hearing. The appointment may be made for cause—such as dishonesty, incompetence, \nor gross mismanagement—or if it is otherwise in the best interests of the creditors. Frequently, the same \nincompetent management that got the business into bankruptcy is left running it—that’s a criticism of \nChapter 11. \n \nCreditors’ Committee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1150 \nThe court must appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after issuing the order \nfor relief. The committee must consist of creditors willing to serve who have the seven largest claims, \nunless the court decides to continue a committee formed before the filing, if the committee was fairly \nchosen and adequately represents the various claims. The committee has several duties, including these: \n(1) to investigate the debtor’s financial affairs, (2) to determine whether to seek appointment of a trustee \nor to let the business continue to operate, and (3) to consult with the debtor or trustee throughout the \ncase. \n \nThe Reorganization Plan \nThe debtor may always file its own plan, whether in a voluntary or involuntary case. If the court leaves the \ndebtor in possession without appointing a trustee, the debtor has the exclusive right to file a \nreorganization plan during the first 120 days. If it does file, it will then have another 60 days to obtain the \ncreditors’ acceptances. Although its exclusivity expires at the end of 180 days, the court may lengthen or \nshorten the period for good cause. At the end of the exclusive period, the creditors’ committee, a single \ncreditor, or a holder of equity in the debtor’s property may file a plan. If the court does appoint a trustee, \nany party in interest may file a plan at any time. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act specifies certain features of the plan and permits others to be included. \nAmong other things, the plan must (1) designate classes of claims and ownership interests; (2) specify \nwhich classes or interests are impaired—a claim or ownership interest is impaired if the creditor’s legal, \nequitable, contractual rights are altered under the plan; (3) specify the treatment of any class of claims or \ninterests that is impaired under the plan; (4) provide the same treatment of each claim or interests of a",

Accessed April 18, 2021.\nWhy We Study Finance\nFinance is the lubricant that keeps our economy running smoothly. Issuing a mortgage can be profitable for a\nbank, but it also allows people to live in their own homes and to pay for them over time. Do MasterCard,\nVenmo, and PayPal make money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and\nsafer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track\nwhere and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to\ncapital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly\nbartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.\nThere are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides\na long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of\nfinancial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among\n2\nBrookings Institution. “Ben S.

Government and\nwork-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must\ntake greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let’s take a closer\nlook at some of the reasons why we study finance.\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may\npique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify\nyou for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in\nCareers in Finance.\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\nanalytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live. Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\nRisk and Return in Finance\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.",

However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\nfavorable growth opportunities.\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a\ncorporation and is another factor that enhances its value.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAmazon\nMost people are surprised to learn than Amazon, the largest online retailer, is set up as an LLC.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n43\nAmazon.com Services LLC is set up as a subsidiary of the larger Amazon.com Inc. Take a look at the Amazon\nLLC company profile provided by Dun & Bradstreet (https://openstax.org/r/company-profiles-amazon).\nWhy do you think such a large corporation is set up as an LLC?\nIncorporating a Business\nMany business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\narticles of incorporation include the following:\n•\nDomestic corporation (in state)\n•\nForeign corporation (out of state or out of country)\n•\nClose (closely held) corporation\n•\nProfessional corporation\n•\nNonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\n•\nStock corporation\n•\nNon-stock corporation\n•\nPublic benefit corporation\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\n2.2\nRelationship between Shareholders and Company Management\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between principals and agents.\n•\nList and discuss various stakeholders associated with a company and its operations.\n•\nExplain how management impacts the operations and future of a company.\nStakeholders\nA stakeholder is any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.\nStakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.",

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls. Whenever there is inflation, a $100 bill will not\npurchase as much as it did before.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCPI Inflation Calculator\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, $100 in January 1913 had the same purchasing power as\n$1,722.45 in January 2000 and $2,699.20 in January 2021. If you would like to compare the purchasing power\nof a dollar amount in two different time periods, you can use the CPI Inflation Calculator\n(https://openstax.org/r/cpi-inflation-calculator). You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

Significant increases in the CPI within a\nshort time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant decreases in CPI within a short time frame\nmight indicate a period of deflation. However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might\nnot be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For more accurate detection, the core CPI,\nor CPILFESL (https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed-org)—the CPIAUCSL minus food and energy—is often\nused. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to all consumers and should not be used to\ndetermine relative living costs. Additionally, the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error\nbecause it is based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is a measure of people who are not working. For the individuals who find themselves without\na job, unemployment causes financial hardship. From a macroeconomics standpoint, unemployment means\nthat society has labor resources that are not being fully utilized.\nNot everyone who is without a job is unemployed. To be considered unemployed, a person must be (1)\njobless, (2) actively seeking work, and (3) able to take a job. The official unemployment rate is the percentage\nof the labor force that is unemployed. It is calculated as\nNote that the unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed, rather\nthan the percent of the total population. Only those who are currently employed or who meet the definition of\nbeing unemployed are counted in the labor force. In other words, someone who is retired or a stay-at-home\nparent and is not seeking employment is not counted as unemployed and is not part of the labor force.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the US Department of Labor reports the unemployment rate each\nmonth. These figures are attained through an interview process of 60,000 households conducted by the\nCensus Bureau.

In 2020, the World Bank\nfigures showed that Cambodia had the lowest unemployment rate at 0.3% and that South Africa has the\nhighest unemployment rate at 28.7%. To compare the rates in various countries, visit the unemployment\nstatistics section (https://openstax.org/r/data-world-bank) of the World Bank website.\nGross Domestic Product\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the size of an economy. A country’s GDP is the dollar value of\nall of the final goods and service produced within that country during a year. GDP measures the value of all of\nthe automobiles produced, apples grown, heart surgeries performed, students educated, and all other new\ngoods and services produced in a current year.\nHow Is GDP Measured?\nGDP can be measured by adding up all of the items that are purchased in the economy. Purchases are divided\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\nexports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,\ncups of coffee, and clothing. Consumption expenditure accounts for about two-thirds of the US GDP.4\nInvestment spending refers primarily to purchases by businesses. It is important to note that in this context,\nthe term investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial securities. Instead, the\nterm refers to purchasing new capital goods, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment, that will be used\nto produce other goods. Residential housing is also included in the investment-spending category, as are\ninventories.

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form\nof\nMXN is an abbreviation for the Mexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known\nas a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nBecause this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as the spot\nexchange rate.\nIf you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.\nSimply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:\nIf you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy\ndollars. Each US dollar will cost you MXN 16.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCurrency Conversion\nDo you want to know how many British pounds your $100 would buy? Or would you like to see how much\nthat 10,000-yen-per-night hotel room will cost you in your home currency? You can enter the amount of one\ncurrency in the MSN Money currency converter (https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter) to see what the\nequivalent amount is in another currency.\nCurrency Appreciation\nJust as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the\ngas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates\n89\nCurrency prices are determined in the marketplace through the same types of supply-and-demand forces we\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\nCurrency Depreciation\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was\n, it\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\ndepreciate.\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\nExchange Rate Risk\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk. As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange",

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\nhave depreciated.\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. Over 765,000 time series of data are available.

Both the balance\nsheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on\nthe preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares\noutstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\nearnings per share is\nBy removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to\ncommon shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to\npreferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While\na number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\nrequires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount\nappears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\nIn the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per\nshare is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout\nthe year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares\nis used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year\nwith 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period\nJanuary 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were\nissued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the\nnext nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\nfractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).",

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\nhigher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\nventures?\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.",

The first method, calculating the\nchange in dividend each year and then averaging these changes, is the arithmetic approach. The second\nmethod, using the first and last dividends only, is the geometric approach. The arithmetic approach is\nequivalent to a simple interest approach, and the geometric approach is equivalent to a compound interest\napproach.\nTo apply our PV formula above, we had to assume that the company would pay dividends forever and that we\nwould hold on to our stock forever. If we assume that we will sell the stock at some point in the future,\nhowever, can we use this formula to estimate the value of a stock held for a finite period of time? The answer\nis a qualified yes. We can adjust this model for a finite horizon to estimate the present value of the dividend\nstream that we will receive while holding the stock. We will still have a problem estimating the stock’s selling\nprice at the end of this finite dividend stream, and we will address this issue shortly. For the finite growing\ndividend stream, we adjust the infinite stream in our earlier equation to the following:\nwhere n is the number of future dividends.\nThis equation may look very complicated, but just focus on the far right part of the model. This part calculates\nthe percentage of the finite dividend stream that you will receive if you sell the stock at the end of the nth year.\nSay you will sell Johnson & Johnson after 10 years. What percentage of the $60.23 (the finite dividend stream)\nwill you get? Begin with the following:\n338\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNow, multiply the result by the price for your portion of the infinite stream:\nThe next step is to discount the selling price of Johnson & Johnson in 10 years at 17% and then add the two\nvalues to get the stock’s price. So, how do we estimate the stock’s price at the end of 10 years? If we elect to\nsell the stock after 10 years and the company will continue to pay dividends at the same growth rate, what\nwould a buyer be willing to pay? How could we estimate the selling price (value) of the stock at that time?\nWe need to estimate the dividend in 10 years and assume a growth rate and the required return of the new\nowner at that point in time. Let’s assume that the new owner also wants a 17% return and that the dividend\ngrowth rate will remain at 13.04%. We calculate the dividend in 10 years by taking the current growth rate plus\none raised to the tenth power times the current dividend:\nWe then use the dividend growth model with infinite horizon to determine the price in 10 years as follows:\nYour price for the stock today—given that you will receive the growing dividend stream for 10 years and sell\nfor $258.10 in 10 years, and also given that you want a 17% return over the 10 years—is as shown below:\nWhy did you get the same price of $60.23 for your stock with both the infinite growth model and the finite\nmodel? The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model\nwith a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales\nof the stock.",

This uncertainty about what the return will\nbe is referred to as risk.\nWe begin by looking at how to measure both risk and return when considering an individual asset, such as one\nstock. If your grandparents bought 100 shares of Apple, Inc. stock for you when you were born, you are\ninterested in knowing how well that investment has done. You may even want to compare how that\ninvestment has fared to how an investment in a different stock, perhaps Disney, would have done. You are\ninterested in measuring the historical return.\nIndividual Investment Realized Return\nThe realized return of an investment is the total return that occurs over a particular time period. Suppose that\nyou purchased a share of Target (TGT) at the beginning of January 2020 for $128.74. At the end of the year, you\nsold the stock for $176.53, which was $47.79 more than you paid for it. This increase in value is known as a\ncapital gain. As the owner of the stock, you also received $2.68 in dividends during 2020. The total dollar return\nfrom your investment is calculated as\nIt is common to express investment returns in percentage terms rather than dollar terms. This allows you to\nanswer the question “How much do I receive for each dollar invested?” so that you can compare investments\nof different sizes. The total percent return from your investment is\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the dividends you received by the initial stock price. This\ncalculation says that for each dollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.0208 in dividends. The capital\ngain yield is the change in the stock price divided by the initial stock price. This calculation says that for each\ndollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.3712 in capital gains. Your total percent return of 39.20% means\nthat you made $0.392 for every dollar invested when your gains from both dividends and stock price\nappreciation are totaled together.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Return\nYou purchased 10 shares of 3M (MMM) stock in January 2020 for $175 per share, received dividends of $5.91\n450\n15 • How to Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nper share, and sold the stock at the end of the year for $169.72 per share.

Your\ncapital gain is negative, or what is often referred to as a capital loss. Although the price fell, you still had a\npositive total dollar return because of the dividend income.\nOf course, investors seldom purchase a stock and then sell it exactly one year later. Assume that you\npurchased shares of Facebook (FB) on June 1, 2020, for $228.50 per share and sold the shares three months\nlater for $261.90. You received no dividends. In this case, your holding period percentage return is calculated\nas\nThis 14.62% is your return for a three-month holding period.

This 22.4% is\ncalled the arithmetic average return.\nThe geometric average return will be smaller than the arithmetic average return (unless the returns for all\nyears are identical). This is due to the basic arithmetic of compounding. Think of a very simple example in\nwhich you invest $100 for two years. If you have a positive return of 50% the first year and a negative 50%\nreturn the second year, you will have an arithmetic average return of\n, but you will have a\ngeometric average return of\n. With a 50% positive return the\nfirst year, you ended the year with $150. The second year, you lost 50% of that balance and were left with only\n$75.\nAnother important fact when studying average returns is that the order in which you earn the returns is not\nimportant. Consider what would have occurred if the returns in the two years were reversed, so that you faced\na loss of 50% in the first year of your investment and a gain of 50% in the second year of your investment. With\na −50% return in the first year, you would have ended that year with only $50. Then, if that $50 earned a\npositive 50% return the second year, you would have a $75 balance at the end of the two-year period. A\nnegative return of 50% followed by a positive return of 50% still results in an arithmetic average return of 0%",

Finance)\nAs investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has\ngood years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just\nlike DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the\nsame for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return\nfor XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive\nreturn. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,\nwashing away some of the volatility.\nWhen an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.\nWhen two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the\nvolatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How\ncorrelated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.\nYou will recall from our study of correlation in Regression Analysis in Finance that a correlation coefficient\ndescribes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a\nperfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two\nvariables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more\n15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\n459\nstrongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated\nin a portfolio decreases risk.\nNotice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard\ndeviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less\nthan one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed\nto many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two\nstocks provides only a small decrease in risk.\nThis is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy\nis strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.\nWhen something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both\ncompanies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is\nspecific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure\nto the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience\npositive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.\nOn the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation\nthan those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM\nis likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the\nstandard deviation of the portfolio more.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHow to Build a Diversified Portfolio\nTV personality, former hedge fund manager, and author Jim Cramer encourages investors to build a\ndiversified portfolio, having no more than 20% of a portfolio in one sector.3 Watch this CNBC video\n(https://openstax.org/r/CNBC_video) to learn more about how he suggests investors can build a diversified\nportfolio by purchasing five to 10 stocks.\nPortfolio Size and Risk\nAs you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases.

Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will\nonly be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to\ntake the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make\ninvesting in US Treasury securities.\nFrom 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher\nthan the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.7 Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,\nhowever, have also been much more volatile.

If one project is 5 years and another is 20 years, the short one is\n492\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nrepeated four times. This method can become tedious when the length of the longer project is not a multiple\nof the shorter project. For example, when choosing between a five-year project and a seven-year project, the\nshort one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated five times\nto get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.\nEqual Annuity Approach\nThe equal annuity approach assumes that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated\nforever. This approach involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\n•\nThe NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\n•\nThe NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\nproject.\n•\nFor the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.\n•\nFor the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\nformula.\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that\nprojects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions\nare likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the\nfuture, these changes are potentially greater.\nChoosing Projects When Resources Are Limited\nChoosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will\nchoose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount\nof capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several\npositive NPV projects. The goal is to maximize the total NPV of the firm’s projects while remaining within\nbudget constraints.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nProfitability Index\nManagers should reject any project with a negative NPV. When managers find themselves with an array of\nprojects with a positive NPV, the profitability index can be used to choose among those projects. To learn\n16.5 • Choosing between Projects\n493\nmore, watch this video about how a company might use the profitability index (https://openstax.org/r/\nmight-use).\nFor example, suppose Southwest Manufacturing is considering the seven projects displayed in Table 16.14.\nEach of the projects has a positive NPV and would add value to the company. The firm has a budget of $200\nmillion to put toward new projects in the upcoming year. Doing all seven of the projects would require initial\ninvestments totaling $430 million. Thus, although all of the projects are good projects, Southwest\nManufacturing cannot fund them all in the upcoming year and must choose among these projects.

            "chunk": "If we use the constant dividend discount model to estimate the cost of equity for Bluebonnet Industries, the\nWACC is computed as\nCalculating WACC in Practice\nThe equation for calculating WACC is straightforward. However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be\nused. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return\nhas been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from\nwhat it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk\npremiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n513\nThe same issue with how much historical data should be considered arises when calculating a company’s beta.\nDifferent financial managers can calculate significantly different betas even for well-established, stable\ncompanies. In April 2021, for example, the beta for IBM was reported as 0.97 by MarketWatch and as 1.25 by\nYahoo! Finance.\nThe CAPM estimate of the cost of equity capital for IBM is significantly different depending on what source is\nused for the company’s beta and what value is used for the market risk premium. Using a market risk\npremium of 5%, the beta of 0.97 provided by MarketWatch, and a risk-free rate of 3% results in a cost of capital\nof\nIf, instead, a market risk premium of 8% and the beta of 1.25 provided by Yahoo! Finance are used, the cost of\ncapital is estimated to be\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating the Equity Cost of Capital\nAlthough the calculation of the cost of capital using the CAPM equation is simple and straightforward, there\nis not one definitive equity cost of capital for a company that all financial managers will agree on. Consider\nthe eight companies spotlighted in Table 17.3.\nFour estimates of the equity cost of capital are calculated for each firm. The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%. If you assume instead that the\naverage long-run return on the S&P 500 is 11%, then people who purchase a portfolio of those stocks are\nrewarded by earning 8 percentage points more than the 3% they would earn investing in the risk-free\nsecurity.\nThe last two estimates of the cost of equity capital for each company also use the same risk-free rate of 3%\nand the possible market risk premiums of 5% and 8%. The only difference is that the beta provided by\nYahoo! Finance is used in the calculation.\nCompany\nIndustry\nMarketWatch\nYahoo!

Finance; MarketWatch)\n514\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example,\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an\nestimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much\nhigher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and\nRubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with\nan estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable\nassumptions.\nWhat is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A\nfinancial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different\nchoices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.",

Thus, firms that face higher costs of financial distress have a lower optimal level of leverage\nthan firms that face lower costs of financial distress.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNetflix\nNetflix has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 25 years. Starting as a DVD rental company, Netflix\nquickly shifted its model to content streaming. In recent years, the company has become a major producer\nof content, and it is currently the largest media/entertainment company by market capitalization. It is\nexpensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content. Netflix has funded much of its content through\nselling debt.\nYou can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answers the\ncompany provides to common investor questions (https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can\nalso find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s\nbalance sheet has increased over the past few years.\nFigure 17.4 demonstrates how the value of a levered firm varies with the level of debt financing used. Vu is the\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\ninterest and taxes (EBIT). Once the interest expense equals EBIT, the firm will have no taxable income. There is\nno tax benefit from paying more interest after that point.\n17.5 • Optimal Capital Structure\n521\nFigure 17.4 Maximum Value of a Levered Firm\nAs the firm increases debt and increases the value of the tax benefit of debt, it also increases the probability of\nfacing financial distress. The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to\ndetermine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target. Reducing debt and increasing equity would require transaction costs that might be quite\nsignificant.\nTable 17.7 shows the average WACC for some common industries. The calculations are based on corporate\ninformation at the end of December 2020. A risk-free rate of 3% and a market-risk premium of 5% are assumed\nin the calculations. You can see that the capital structure used by firms varies widely by industry. Companies in\nthe online retail industry are financed almost entirely through equity capital; on average, less than 7% of the\ncapital comes from debt for those companies. On the other hand, companies in the rubber and tires industry\ntend to use a heavy amount of debt in their capital structure. With a debt weight of 63.62%, almost two-thirds\nof the capital for these companies comes from debt.\nIndustry Name\nEquity Weight Debt Weight Beta Cost of Equity Tax Rate\nAfter-Tax\nCost of Debt WACC\nRetail (online)\n93.33%\n6.67% 1.16\n8.82%\n2.93%\n2.19% 8.38%\nComputers/peripherals\n91.45%\n8.55% 1.18\n8.92%\n3.71%\n1.88% 8.32%\nHousehold products\n87.07%\n12.93% 0.73\n6.65%\n5.06%\n2.19% 6.07%\nDrugs (pharmaceutical)\n84.62%\n15.38% 0.91\n7.54%\n1.88%\n2.19% 6.72%\nTable 17.7 Capital Structure, Cost of Debt, Cost of Equity, and WACC for Selected Industries (data source: Aswath\nDamodaran Online)\n522\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIndustry Name\nEquity Weight Debt Weight Beta Cost of Equity Tax Rate\nAfter-Tax\nCost of Debt WACC\nRetail (general)\n82.41%\n17.59% 0.90\n7.49%\n12.48%\n1.88% 6.51%\nBeverages (soft)\n82.24%\n17.76% 0.79\n6.96%\n3.32%\n2.19% 6.11%\nTobacco\n76.74%\n23.26% 0.72\n6.61%\n8.69%\n1.88% 5.51%\nHomebuilding\n75.34%\n24.66% 1.46\n10.29%\n15.91%\n2.19% 8.30%\nFood processing\n75.18%\n24.82% 0.64\n6.18%\n8.56%\n2.19% 5.19%\nRestaurants/dining\n74.79%\n25.21% 1.34\n9.72%\n3.19%\n2.19% 7.82%\nApparel\n71.74%\n28.26% 1.10\n8.49%\n4.75%\n2.19% 6.71%\nFarming/agriculture\n68.94%",

The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are\nrequiring to lend money to the company. Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the\ncompany is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must\nestimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend\ngrowth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n17.3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nCalculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the formula\nRemember that the WACC is an estimate; different methods of estimating the cost of equity capital can lead to\ndifferent estimations of WACC.\n17.4 Capital Structure Choices\nAn unlevered firm uses no debt in its capital structure. A levered firm uses both debt and equity in its capital\nstructure. In perfect financial markets, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the firm’s decision\nto use leverage. With the tax deductibility of interest expenses, however, the value of the firm can increase\nthrough the use of debt. As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.\n17.5 Optimal Capital Structure\nA company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases. Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt\nequals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.\n17.6 Alternative Sources of Funds\nPreferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over\ncommon stockholders in the order of claimants. A fixed dividend is paid to preferred shareholders and must\nbe paid before common shareholders receive dividends.

            "chunk": "for future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many people in\n18.3 • Pro Forma Financials\n545\nquarantine still wanting to make healthy lifestyle choices, sporting goods stores were making record sales.\nRecord-breaking sales, however, are not certain in the future. The impacts of the pandemic are extremely\ndifficult to predict, making it a challenge for Big 5 Sporting Goods and other companies to assemble pro\nforma financial statements.\n(sources: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/27/2115470/0/en/Big-5-Sporting-Goods-\nCorporation-Announces-Record-Fiscal-2020-Third-Quarter-Results.html; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/\ninvestors-want-big-5-sporting-054658521.html; https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/accounting-audit/\nnews/21206691/four-ways-covid19-will-impact-2021-financial-forecasting-and-planning)\nDetermine Potential Changes in Variables\nSo far, we have focused on using historical common-size statements to create a draft (not a final version) of\nthe forecast. This is because the past isn’t always a perfect indicator of the future, and our finances don’t\nalways follow a linear pattern. We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we\nknow to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.\nMany items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,\ngather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the\npotential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an\nexhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.\n•\nIt has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in\nmonthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.\n•\nIt will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to\nbegin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s\nmonthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,\nand August.\n•\nThe company has just finished updating its employee compensation package. It goes into effect in January\nof the new year and will result in an overall 4% increase in the cost of labor.\n•\nThe landlord indicated that rent will increase by $50 per month starting July 1.\n•\nSome fixed assets will be fully depreciated by the end of March. Thus, depreciation expense will go down\nby $25 per month beginning in April.\n•\nThere are rumors of new regulations that will impact the costs of importing some of the more difficult-to-\nobtain hunting supplies. Managers aren’t entirely sure of the full impact of the new legislation at this time,",

Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk. In 2020, corporations experienced an unprecedented risk\nbecause of COVID-19. Coffee shops were forced to remain closed as communities experienced government-\n3\nStarbucks.

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of\noperating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStarbucks\nThe most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on\nthe company’s investor relations website under the Financial Data section (https://openstax.org/r/\nFinancial_Data_section).

Managers must be aware of\ndiffering business climates and customs and operate under multiple legal systems. Often, business must be\nconducted in multiple languages. Geopolitical events can impact business relationships. In addition, the\ncompany may receive cash flows and make payments in multiple currencies.\nExchange Rates\nThe costs to companies are impacted when the prices of the raw materials they use change. Very little coffee is\ngrown in the United States. This means that all of those coffee beans that Starbucks uses in its espresso\nmachines in Seattle, New York, Miami, and Houston were bought from suppliers outside of the United States.\nBrazil is the largest coffee-producing country, exporting about one-third of the world’s coffee.6 When a\ncompany purchases raw materials from a supplier in another country, the company needs not just money but\nthe money that is used in that country to make the purchase. Thus, the company is concerned about the\nexchange rate, or the price of the foreign currency.\nFigure 20.2 Brazilian Reals to One US Dollar7\nThe currency used in Brazil is called the Brazilian real. Figure 20.2 shows how many Brazilian reals could be\npurchased for $1.00 from 2010 through the first quarter of 2021. In March 2021, 5.4377 Brazilian reals could be\npurchased for $1.00.

This price is known as a\ncurrency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nIf you know the price of $1.00 is 5.4377 Brazilian reals, you can easily find the price of Brazilian reals in US\ndollars. Simply divide both sides of the equation by 5.4377, or the price of the US dollar:\nIf you have US dollars and want to purchase Brazilian reals, it will cost you $0.1839 for each Brazilian real you\nwant to buy.\nThe foreign exchange rate changes in response to demand for and supply of the currency. In early 2020, the\nexchange rate was\n. In other words, $1 purchased fewer reals in early 2020 than in it did a\nyear later. Because you receive more reals for each dollar in 2021 than you would have a year earlier, the dollar\nis said to have appreciated relative to the Brazilian real. Likewise, because it takes more Brazilian reals to\npurchase $1.00, the real is said to have depreciated relative to the US dollar.\nExchange Rate Risks\nStarbucks, like other firms that are engaged in international business, faces currency exchange rate risk.\nChanges in exchange rates can impact a business in several ways. These risks are often classified as\ntransaction, translation, or economic risk.\nTransaction Risk\nTransaction risk is the risk that the value of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result\nof a change in currency exchange rates. If Starbucks agrees to pay a Brazilian coffee grower seven million\nBrazilian reals for an order of one million pounds of coffee beans, Starbucks will need to purchase Brazilian\nreals to pay the bill. How much it will cost Starbucks to purchase these Brazilian reals depends on the\nexchange rate at the time Starbucks makes the purchase.\nIn March 2021, with an exchange rate of\n, it would have cost Starbucks\nto purchase the reals needed to receive the one million pounds of coffee\nbeans. If, however, Starbucks agreed in March to purchase the coffee beans several months later, in July,\nStarbucks would not have known then what the exchange rate would be when it came time to complete the\ntransaction. Although Starbucks would have locked in a price of BRL 7,000,000 for one million pounds of coffee\nbeans, it would not have known what the coffee beans would cost the company in terms of US dollars.\nIf the US dollar appreciated so that it cost less to purchase each Brazilian real in July, Starbucks would find that\nit was paying less than $1,287,300 for the coffee beans. For example, suppose the dollar appreciated so that\nthe exchange rate was\nin July 2021. Then the coffee beans would only cost Starbucks\n.",

If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,\nthen this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance. The loss is\ndue simply to changes in exchange rates and not the underlying profitability of the company.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers or its\nsales. Even a company that is not involved in international transactions can face this type of risk. Consider a\ncompany located in Mississippi that makes shirts using 100% US-grown cotton. All of the shirts are made in the\nUnited States and sold to retail outlets in the United States. Thus, all of the company’s expenses and revenues\nare in US dollars, and the company holds no assets outside of the United States.\nAlthough this firm has no financial transactions involving international currency, it can be impacted by\nchanges in exchange rates. Suppose the US dollar strengthens relative to the Vietnamese dong. This will allow\nUS retail outlets to purchase more Vietnamese dong, and thus more shirts from Vietnamese suppliers, for the\nsame amount of US dollars. Because of this, the retail outlets experience a drop in the cost of procuring the\nVietnamese shirts relative to the shirts produced by the firm in Mississippi. The Mississippi company will lose\nsome of its customers to these Vietnamese producers simply because of a change in the exchange rate.\nHedging\nJust as companies may practice hedging techniques to reduce their commodity risk exposure, they may\nchoose to hedge to reduce their currency risk exposure. The types of futures contracts that we discussed\nearlier in this chapter exist for currencies as well as for commodities. A company that knows that it will need\nKorean won later this year to purchase raw materials from a South Korean supplier, for example, can purchase\na futures contract for Korean won.\nWhile futures contracts allow companies to lock in prices today for a future commitment, these contracts are\nnot flexible enough to meet the risk management needs of all companies. Futures contracts are standardized\ncontracts. This means that the contracts have set sizes and maturity dates. Futures contracts for Korean won,\nfor example, have a contract size of 125 million won. A company that needs 200 million won later this year\nwould need to either purchase one futures contract, hedging only a portion of its needs, or purchase two\nfutures contracts, hedging more than it needs. Either way, the company has remaining currency risk.\nIn this next section, we will explore some additional hedging techniques.\nForward Contracts\nSuppose a company needs access to 200 million Korean won on March 1. In addition to a specified contract\nsize, currency futures contracts have specified days on which the contracts are settled. For most currency\nfutures contracts, this occurs on the third Wednesday of the month. If the company needed 125 million Korean\nwon (the basic contract size) on the third Wednesday of March (the standard settlement date), the futures\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n607\ncontract could be useful. Because the company needs a different number of Korean won on a different date\nfrom those specified in the standard contract, the futures contract is not going to meet the specific risk\nmanagement needs of the company.\nAnother type of contract, the forward contract, can be used by this company to meet its specific needs. A\nforward contract is simply a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of\ncurrencies at a future date. A company can approach its bank, for example, saying that it will need to purchase\n200 million Korean won on March 1. The bank will quote a forward rate, which is a rate specified today for the\nsale of currency on a future date, and the company and the bank can enter into a forward contract to\nexchange dollars for 200 million Korean won at the quoted rate on March 1.\nBecause a forward contract is a contract between two parties, those two parties can specify the amount that\nwill be traded and the date the trade will occur. This contract is similar to your agreeing with a hotel that you\nwill arrive on March 1 and rent a room for three nights at $200 per night. You are agreeing today to show up at\nthe hotel on a future (specified) date and pay the quoted price when you arrive. The hotel agrees to provide\nyou the room on March 1 and cannot change the price of the room when you arrive. With a forward contract,",

The payoff to the company for the option is INR -5, the premium\nthat was paid for the option that was never used (see Figure 20.6).\nFigure 20.6 The Payoff to the Holder of a Put Option\nIf, however, in three months, the spot exchange rate is anything less than\n, then the\ncompany will choose to exercise the option. If the spot rate is between\nand\n, the payoff for the option is negative. For example, if the spot exchange rate is\n, the company will exercise the option and receive three more Indian rupees per dollar than\nit would in the spot market. However, the company had to spend INR 5 for the option, so the payoff is INR -2.\nAt a spot exchange rate of\n, the company has a zero payoff; the benefit of exercising the\noption, INR 5, is exactly equal to the price of purchasing the option, the premium of INR 5.\nIf, in three months, the spot exchange rate is anything below\n, the payoff of the put option is\npositive. At the theoretical extreme, if the USD became worthless and would purchase no rupees in the spot\nmarket when the company received the dollars, the company could exercise its option and receive INR 75/USD,\nand its payoff would be INR 70.\nNow that we have considered the payoff to a purchaser of a put contract, let’s consider the opposite side of\nthe contract: the seller, or writer, of the put option. The writer of a put option is selling the right to sell dollars\nto the purchaser of the put option. The writer of the put option collects a premium for this. The writer of the\nput has no choice as to whether the put option will be exercised; the writer only has an obligation to honor the\ncontract if the owner of the put option chooses to exercise it.\nThe owner of the option will choose to let the option expire if the spot exchange rate is anything above\n. If that is the case, the writer of the put option collects the INR 5 premium for writing the\nput, as shown by the horizontal line in Figure 20.7. This is what the writer of the put is hoping will occur.\n612\n20 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 20.7 The Payoff to the Writer of a Put Option\nThe owner of the option will choose to exercise the option if the exchange rate is less than\n.\nIf the spot exchange rate is between\nand\n, the writer of the put option has\na positive payoff. Although the writer must now purchase US dollars for a price higher than what the dollars\nare worth, the INR 5 premium that the writer received when entering into the position is more than enough to\noffset that loss.\nIf the spot exchange rate drops below\n, however, the writer of the put option is losing more\nthan INR 5 when the option is exercised, leaving the writer with a negative payoff. In the extreme, the writer of\nthe put will have to purchase worthless US dollars for INR 75/USD, resulting in a loss of INR 70.\nNotice that the payoff to the writer of the put is the negative of the payoff to the holder of the put at every\nspot price. The highest payoff occurs to the writer of the put when the option is never exercised. In that\ninstance, the payoff to the writer is the premium that the holder of the put paid when purchasing the option\n(see Figure 20.7).\nTable 20.2 provides a summary of the positions that the parties who enter into options contract are in.\nRemember that the buyer of an option is always the one purchasing the right to do something.
