Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”).

When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages.

The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court.

(3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy.

They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring.

You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do.",

Understand one model for ethical decision making: a process to arrive at the most ethical option for an \nindividual or a business organization, using a virtue ethics approach combined with some elements of \nstakeholder analysis and utilitarianism. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Model \nOnce you recognize that there is a decision that involves ethical judgment, Michael Josephson would first \nhave you ask as many questions as are necessary to get a full background on the relevant facts. Then, \nassuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: \n1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions \nthat might be made here? \n2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made. \n3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision. \n4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values. \n5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which \ndecision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders. \n \nIt is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why. In Milton \nFriedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders. In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods \nMarket, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come \nfirst, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 \"Corporations \nand Corporate Governance\"). \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n62 \nThe Core Values \nHere are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nTrustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be \nsincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and \ndon’t betray a trust. Demonstrate integrity—stand up for what you believe, walk the walk as well \nas talking the talk; be what you seem to be; show commitment and courage. Be loyal—stand by \nyour family, friends, co-workers, community, and nation; be discreet with information that \ncomes into your hands; don’t spread rumors or engage in harmful gossip; don’t violate your \nprinciples just to win friendship or approval; don’t ask a friend to do something that is",

Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers \nhired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are \nnot always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law \nrequire officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the \ncompany. This is the “agency problem” often discussed in corporate governance: how to get officers and \nother top management to align their own interests with those of the shareholders. For example, a CEO \nmight trade insider information to the detriment of the company’s shareholders. Even board members are \nsusceptible to misalignment of interets; for example, board members might resist hostile takeover bids \nbecause they would likely lose their perks (short for perquisites) as directors, even though the tender offer \nwould benefit stockholders.

Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability. This is a right granted by the state, a right granted for \ngood and practical reasons for encouraging capital and innovation. But with this right comes a related \nduty, not clearly stated at law, but assumed when a charter is granted by the state: that the corporate form \nof doing business is legal because the government feels that it socially useful to do so. \n \nImplicitly, then, there is a social contract between governments and corporations: as long as corporations \nare considered socially useful, they can exist.

Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response.

If the \ncode is just a document that goes into a drawer or onto a shelf, it will not effectively encourage good \nconduct within the corporation. The same is true of any kind of training that the company undertakes, \nwhether it be in racial sensitivity or sexual harassment. If the message is not continuously reinforced, or \n(worse yet) if the message is undermined by management’s actions, the real message to employees is that \nviolations of the ethics code will not be taken seriously, or that efforts to stop racial discrimination or \nsexual harassment are merely token efforts, and that the important things are profits and performance. \nThe ethics code at Enron seems to have been one of those “3-P” codes that wind up sitting on shelves—\n“Print, Post, and Pray.” Worse, the Enron board twice suspended the code in 1999 to allow outside \npartnerships to be led by a top Enron executive who stood to gain financially from them. [5] \n \nEthics Hotlines and Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nThe federal sentencing guidelines were enacted in 1991. The original idea behind these guidelines was for \nCongress to correct the lenient treatment often given to white-collar, or corporate, criminals. The \nguidelines require judges to consider “aggravating and mitigating” factors in determining sentences and \nfines. (While corporations cannot go to jail, its officers and managers certainly can, and the corporation \nitself can be fined. Many companies will claim that it is one bad apple that has caused the problem; the \nguidelines invite these companies to show that they are in fact tending their orchard well. They can show \nthis by providing evidence that they have (1) a viable, active code of ethics; (2) a way for employees to \nreport violations of law or the ethics code; and (3) an ethics ombudsman, or someone who oversees the \ncode. \n \nIn short, if a company can show that it has an ongoing process to root out wrongdoing at all levels of the \ncompany, the judge is allowed to consider this as a major mitigating factor in the fines the company will \npay.

California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n•",

Understanding the long-standing \nperspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting \nout the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses. Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices. A firm that has purpose and passion \nbeyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself \nfor long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nConsider again Milton Friedman’s article. \na. What does Friedman mean by “ethical custom”? \nb. If the laws of the society are limiting the company’s profitability, would the company be within \nits rights to disobey the law? \nc. \nWhat if the law is “on the books,” but the company could count on a lack of enforcement from \nstate officials who were overworked and underpaid? Should the company limit its profits? \nSuppose that it could save money by discharging a pollutant into a nearby river, adversely \naffecting fish and, potentially, drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities. In \npolluting against laws that aren’t enforced, is it still acting “within the rules of the game”? What \nif almost all other companies in the industry were saving money by doing similar acts? \n2 \nConsider again the Harris v. Forklift case at the end of Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Law and Legal \nSystems\". The Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Harris was entitled to be heard again by the federal \ndistrict court, which means that there would be a trial on her claim that Mr. Hardy, owner of Forklift \nSystems, had created a “hostile working environment” for Ms. Harris. Apart from the legal aspects, \ndid he really do anything unethical? How can you tell? \na. Which of his actions, if any, were contrary to utilitarian thinking?",

This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench. In some federal districts, judgments \nfor plaintiffs may be higher, on average, than in the local state court. In short, not only law but also \nlegal strategy factor into the popularity of diversity cases in federal courts. \n \n \nState Court Systems \nThe vast majority of civil lawsuits in the United States are filed in state courts. Two aspects of civil \nlawsuits are common to all state courts: trials and appeals. A court exercising a trial function \nhas original jurisdiction—that is, jurisdiction to determine the facts of the case and apply the law to \nthem. A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states).

The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes.

A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills.

At the \nfirst level are the federal district courts, which are the trial courts in the federal system. Every state has \none or more federal districts; the less populous states have one, and the more populous states (California, \nTexas, and New York) have four. The federal court with the heaviest commercial docket is the US District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). There are forty-four district judges and fifteen \nmagistrates in this district. The district judges throughout the United States commonly preside over all \nfederal trials, both criminal and civil. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n87 \nCourts of Appeal \nCases from the district courts can then be appealed to the circuit courts of appeal, of which there are \nthirteen (Figure 3.1 \"The Federal Judicial Circuits\"). Each circuit oversees the work of the district courts in \nseveral states. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district \ncourts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears \nappeals from district courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, \nHawaii, and Guam. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals from the \ndistrict court in Washington, DC, as well as from numerous federal administrative agencies (see Chapter 5 \n\"Administrative Law\"). The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington, hears \nappeals in patent and customs cases. Appeals are usually heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes \nthere will be a rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges sit to hear the case “en \nbanc.” \n \nThere are also several specialized courts in the federal judicial system. These include the US Tax Court, \nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims. \n \nUnited States Supreme Court \nOverseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC.

Implied in this list is the clear notion that states would continue to have \ntheir own laws, interpreted by their own courts, and that federal courts were needed only where the issues \nraised by the parties had a clear federal connection. The exception to this is diversity jurisdiction, \ndiscussed later. \n \nThe Constitution was constructed with the idea that state courts would continue to deal with basic kinds \nof claims such as tort, contract, or property claims. Since states sanction marriages and divorce, state \ncourts would deal with “domestic” (family) issues. Since states deal with birth and death records, it stands \nto reason that paternity suits, probate disputes, and the like usually wind up in state courts. You wouldn’t \ngo to the federal building or courthouse to get a marriage license, ask for a divorce, or probate a will: these \nmatters have traditionally been dealt with by the states (and the thirteen original colonies before them). \nMatters that historically get raised and settled in state court under state law include not only domestic and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n91 \nprobate matters but also law relating to corporations, partnerships, agency, contracts, property, torts, and \ncommercial dealings generally.

Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years. Depositions can consume days or even weeks of an executive’s time. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nMany cases never get to trial. They are disposed of by motions to dismiss or are settled after extensive \ndiscovery makes clear to the parties the strengths and weaknesses of the parties to the dispute. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n110 \n \n \nEXERCISES",

Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the \nattorneys. The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence. A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant.

Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts. \n2. Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n121 \n \n \nAlmost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney. But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional?

But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave.

The mediator will communicate the \nparties’ positions to each other, will facilitate the finding of common ground, and will suggest outcomes. \nBut the parties have complete control: they may ignore the recommendations of the mediator entirely, \nsettle in their own way, find another mediator, agree to binding arbitration, go to court, or forget the \nwhole thing! \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n129 \nLitigation is not the only way to resolve disputes. Informal negotiation between the disputants usually comes \nfirst, but both mediation and arbitration are available. Arbitration, though, is final and binding. Once you \nagree to arbitrate, you will have a final, binding arbitral award that is enforceable through the courts, and \ncourts will almost never allow you to litigate after you have agreed to arbitrate. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

This \nwas enough to sustain federal regulation based on the commerce clause. [3] \n \nFor nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that Congress could almost always find some \ninterstate commerce connection for any law it might pass. It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 \nwhen the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that \nprohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The law was part of a twenty-year trend \n(roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime. Lopez’s \nlawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged \nthe law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this \nlegislation. The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the \nSupreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because \neducation of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near \nschool yards detracted from students’ education. The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the \ngovernment’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything. \nLopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court. \n \nCongress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided. But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair \ninterstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy \nBrzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players \nat Virginia Tech, had raped her.

Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process.

Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities \nthrough Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west \ncoast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route. \n \nConsolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks. One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40-foot two-\naxle trailer. This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall. Such trucks have \nlong been used on the Nation’s highways. Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle \ntrailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single-axle trailer. This combination, known \nas a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall. Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, \nincreasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities. Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways.

Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce \nimposed by Iowa’s law. On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests.",

Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce.

It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local \nconcern. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350. For example, regulations that \ntouch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to \ninvalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited). Indeed, “if safety justifications are \nnot illusory, the Court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison \nwith related burdens on interstate commerce.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 449. Those who would \nchallenge such bona fide safety regulations must overcome a “strong presumption of validity.” Bibb v. \nNavajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 at (1959). \nBut the incantation of a purpose to promote the public health or safety does not insulate a state law from \nCommerce Clause attack.

Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded \nthe use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as \nin Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-\nfoot singles. Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western \nStates. Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck. In the absence of \ncongressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must \nbe tolerated. But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its \nregulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state \nlaw cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause. \n \n \n \nA \nIowa made a more serious effort to support the safety rationale of its law than did Wisconsin in Raymond, \nbut its effort was no more persuasive. As noted above, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” The record supports this finding. The trial focused on a \ncomparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories. The evidence \nshowed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in \nthe ability to brake, turn, and maneuver. The double, because of its axle placement, produces less splash \nand spray in wet weather. And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to",

In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be \ndriven to transport the same quantity of goods. Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to \ndistance traveled.

We turn to that task. \n \nAs the District Court correctly found, the challenged statute has the practical effect of not only burdening \ninterstate sales of Washington apples, but also discriminating against them. This discrimination takes \nvarious forms. The first, and most obvious, is the statute’s consequence of raising the costs of doing \nbusiness in the North Carolina market for Washington apple growers and dealers, while leaving those of \ntheir North Carolina counterparts unaffected. [This] disparate effect results from the fact that North \nCarolina apple producers, unlike their Washington competitors, were not forced to alter their marketing \npractices in order to comply with the statute. They were still free to market their wares under the USDA \ngrade or none at all as they had done prior to the statute’s enactment. Obviously, the increased costs \nimposed by the statute would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington \napple growers and dealers who are already at a competitive disadvantage because of their great distance \nfrom the North Carolina market. \n \nSecond, the statute has the effect of stripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive \nand economic advantages it has earned for itself through its expensive inspection and grading system. The \nrecord demonstrates that the Washington apple-grading system has gained nationwide acceptance in the \napple trade.

Political speech is so ingrained in our \nculture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws.

Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and \ninformative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment \nrights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted \nmessages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic \nviews. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to \npoint out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials. \n \nRapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression—\ncounsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. \nToday, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. Soon, \nhowever, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide \ncitizens with significant information about political candidates and issues. Yet, §441b would seem to ban a \nblog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with \ncorporate funds. The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions \nbased on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech. \n \nDue consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is overruled.

Monopolies, for example, happen in \nthe natural course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1.

Understand how Congress controls administrative agencies. \n3. Understand how the courts can control administrative agencies. \n \n \nDuring the course of the past seventy years, a substantial debate has been conducted, often in shrill \nterms, about the legitimacy of administrative lawmaking. One criticism is that agencies are \n“captured” by the industry they are directed to regulate. Another is that they overregulate, stifling \nindividual initiative and the ability to compete. During the 1960s and 1970s, a massive outpouring of \nfederal law created many new agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones. In the \nlate 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress began to deregulate American society, and \nderegulation increased under the Reagan administration. But the accounting frauds of WorldCom, \nEnron, and others led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown of 2008 has \nled to reregulation of the financial sector. It remains to be seen whether the Deepwater Horizon oil \nblowout of 2010 will lead to more environmental regulations or a rethinking on how to make \nagencies more effective regulators. \n \nAdministrative agencies are the focal point of controversy because they are policy-making bodies, \nincorporating facets of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form that fits uneasily at \nbest in the framework of American government (see Figure 5.1 \"Major Administrative Agencies of the \nUnited States\"). They are necessarily at the center of tugging and hauling by the legislature, the \nexecutive branch, and the judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising political control \nover them. In early 1990, for example, the Bush administration approved a Food and Drug \nAdministration regulation that limited disease-prevention claims by food packagers, reversing a \nposition by the Reagan administration in 1987 permitting such claims. \n \nFigure 5.1 Major Administrative Agencies of the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n214",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision.

[2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions.

For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job.

But then one year he got the \nopportunity to make some extra money. Not wishing to lose his pension, he called an employee relations \nspecialist in the US Navy and asked how much he could earn and still keep his pension. The specialist \ngave him erroneous information over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form that said \nCharles could safely take on the extra work. Unfortunately, as it turned out, Charles did exceed the salary \nlimit, and so the government cut off his pension during the time he earned too much. Charles sues to \nrecover his lost pension. He argues that he relied to his detriment on false information supplied by the \nnavy and that in fairness the government should be estopped from denying his claim. \n \nUnfortunately for Charles, he will lose his case. In Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, the \nSupreme Court reasoned that it would be unconstitutional to permit recovery.

According to \nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976), “feasible” means \n“capable of being done, executed, or effected.” In accord, the Oxford English Dictionary 116 (1933) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n235 \n(“Capable of being done, accomplished or carried out”); Funk & Wagnalls New “Standard” Dictionary of \nthe English Language 903 (1957) (“That may be done, performed or effected”). Thus, § 6(b)(5) directs the \nSecretary to issue the standard that “most adequately assures…that no employee will suffer material \nimpairment of health,” limited only by the extent to which this is “capable of being done.” In effect then, \nas the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits, by \nplacing the “benefit” of worker health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this \n“benefit” unachievable.

Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal.",

So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an \ninstrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false signature is \nby no means the only way to commit forgery. If done with intent to defraud, the backdating of a \ndocument, the modification of a corporate name, or the filling in of lines left blank on a form can all \nconstitute forgery. \n \nExtortion \nUnder common law, extortion could only be committed by a government official, who corruptly \ncollected an unlawful fee under color of office.

Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the \ncrime. \n \n \nTo be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient. But what \nconstitutes an act? This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead? The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison).

Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the \nguilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But imputation of guilt is not \nlimited to a conspiracy. The agent may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate officer \ndirects a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home. The employee \nreasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains \nmoney that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit.

The tendency is to hold \nthe corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group \nwithin the corporation (the president or board of directors). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAlthough proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by \ninference (circumstantially).

Describe the basic elements of trial and posttrial criminal procedure. \n \n \nThe procedure for criminal prosecutions is complex. Procedures will vary from state to state. A \ncriminal case begins with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing from the scene; if \nthe defendant is not caught, a warrant for the defendant’s arrest will issue. The warrant is issued by a \njudge or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge of a specific crime against the \naccused.

The warrant will be issued to any officer or agency that has power to arrest the \naccused with warrant in hand. \n \nThe accused will be brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing. The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail.

For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial.

Cf. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 258 (1952). Cases under \nthe Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 reflected the view both that knowledge or intent were not \nrequired to be proved in prosecutions under its criminal provisions, and that responsible corporate agents \ncould be subjected to the liability thereby imposed. \n* * * \n \nThe rationale of the interpretation given the Act in Dotterweich…has been confirmed in our subsequent \ncases. Thus, the Court has reaffirmed the proposition that the public interest in the purity of its food is so \ngreat as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors. \n \nThus Dotterweich and the cases which have followed reveal that in providing sanctions which reach and \ntouch the individuals who execute the corporate mission—and this is by no means necessarily confined to \na single corporate agent or employee—the Act imposes not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy \nviolations when they occur but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that \nviolations will not occur. The requirements of foresight and vigilance imposed on responsible corporate \nagents are beyond question demanding, and perhaps onerous, but they are no more stringent than the \npublic has a right to expect of those who voluntarily assume positions of authority in business enterprises \nwhose services and products affect the health and well-being of the public that supports them. \n \n* * * \n \nReading the entire charge satisfies us that the jury’s attention was adequately focused on the issue of \nrespondent’s authority with respect to the conditions that formed the basis of the alleged violations. \nViewed as a whole, the charge did not permit the jury to find guilt solely on the basis of respondent’s \nposition in the corporation; rather, it fairly advised the jury that to find guilt it must find respondent “had \na responsible relation to the situation,” and “by virtue of his position…had…authority and responsibility” \nto deal with the situation. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n276 \nThe situation referred to could only be “food…held in unsanitary conditions in a warehouse with the result",

The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation.

Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim.

If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house.

How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed?

Factual \nissues are for the jury to resolve. Since it is frequently difficult to make out the requisite proof, the law \nallows certain presumptions and rules of evidence that ease the plaintiff’s task, on the ground that without \nthem substantial injustice would be done. One important rule goes by the Latin \nphrase res ipsa loquitur, meaning “the thing speaks for itself.” The best evidence is always the most \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n302 \ndirect evidence: an eyewitness account of the acts in question.

Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no \none saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly \nconclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference \nof negligence. A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of \nnegligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, \nand the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the \nmanagement use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the \ndefendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] \n \nIf a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane \ncrashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the \ndefendants, that there was negligence.

In a few \nstates today, this rule of contributory negligence is still in effect.

This rule was so manifestly unjust in many \ncases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version \nof comparative negligence. Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned \naccording to the defendant’s degree of culpability.

Rather than decide the case based on \nwarranties, or requiring that Greenman prove how the defendant had been negligent, Justice Traynor \nfound for the plaintiff based on the overall social utility of strict liability in cases of defective products. \nAccording to his decision, the purpose of such liability is to ensure that the “cost of injuries resulting from \ndefective products is borne by the manufacturers…rather than by the injured persons who are powerless \nto protect themselves.” \n \nToday, the majority of US states recognize strict liability for defective products, although some states limit \nstrict liability actions to damages for personal injuries rather than property damage.

It is a widely accepted \nstatement of the liabilities of sellers of goods for defective products. The Restatement specifies six \nrequirements, all of which must be met for a plaintiff to recover using strict liability for a product that the \nplaintiff claims is defective: \n \n1. The product must be in a defective condition when the defendant sells it. \n2. The defendant must normally be engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing the \nproduct. \n3. The product must be unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer because of its defective \ncondition. \n4. The plaintiff must incur physical harm to self or to property by using or consuming the product. \n5. The defective condition must be the proximate cause of the injury or damage. \n6.

In fact it contained fireworks, but there \nwas nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents. The fireworks when they fell exploded.

Thus the status of the Slave has \ndisappeared—it has been superseded by the contractual relation of the servant to his master. . . . \nThe status of the Female under Tutelage . . . has also ceased to exist. . . . So too the status of the \nSon under Power has no true place in the law of modern European societies. If any civil \nobligation binds together the Parent and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives \nits legal validity.... If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to \nsignify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we \nmay say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from \nStatus to Contract. [1] \n \nThis movement was not accidental. It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the \nfifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy \nwith all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, \ncommercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n330 \nContract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan. It was a response to \nchanging conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted, preferring the quieter, imagined \npastoral life of their forefathers. Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, \ndid a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with modem capitalism. \n \nContract Defined \nAs usual in the law, the legal definition of “contract” is formalistic. The Restatement says: “A contract is \na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which \nthe law in some way recognizes as a duty.” (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 1) Similarly, the \nUniform Commercial Code says: “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the",

If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car. Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you. \nA voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing.

(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES",

That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard. The Restatement (Second) of \nContracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n342 \nanother.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their \nlanguage or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or \ncourse of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what \nthey thought they said or did. \n \nThe distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims \nhe spoke in jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment.

The court disagreed, \nholding that it was reasonable to interpret the pledge of $100,000 as a means of promoting punchboards: \n \n(I)f the jest is not apparent and a reasonable hearer would believe that an offer was being made, \nthen the speaker risks the formation of a contract which was not intended.

The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor. Whether \nconsideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to \nmake the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment. (Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the \npromisor is sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did \nthe promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise? Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting. In the third example, \nwhat might appear to be such a promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou \ncome to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift. Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book. \n \nThere is a widely recognized exception to the requirement of consideration.

These relationships can be summed up in a simple \ndiagram (see Figure 9.1 \"Agency Relationships\"). \n \nFigure 9.1 Agency Relationships \n \n \nIn this chapter, we will consider the principal-agent side of the triangle. In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer",

For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer \nfor his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant.

Though he is free, \nin the absence of contract, to compete with his former principal, he may not use information learned in \nthe course of his agency, such as trade secrets and customer lists.

Volvo Service Center, Inc., deals with an agent’s breach of the duty of confidentiality. \n \nOther Duties \nIn addition to fiduciary responsibility (and whatever special duties may be contained in the specific \ncontract) the law of agency imposes other duties on an agent. These duties are not necessarily unique to \nagents: a nonfiduciary employee could also be bound to these duties on the right facts. \n \nDuty of Skill and Care \nAn agent is usually taken on because he has special knowledge or skills that the principal wishes to tap. \nThe agent is under a legal duty to perform his work with the care and skill that is “standard in the locality \nfor the kind of work which he is employed to perform” and to exercise any special skills, if these are \ngreater or more refined than those prevalent among those normally employed in the community.

The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status. Indeed, Microsoft has pointed to no \nevidence suggesting that it ever denied eligibility to any employees, whom it understood to be common-\nlaw employees, by paying them through the accounts receivable department or otherwise. \n \nWe therefore construe the ambiguity in the plan against Microsoft and hold that the plaintiffs are eligible \nto participate under the terms of the SPP. \n \n[Next, regarding the ESPP] we hold that the plaintiffs…are covered by the specific provisions of the ESPP. \nWe apply the “objective manifestation theory of contracts,” which requires us to “impute an intention \ncorresponding to the reasonable meaning of a person’s words and acts.” [Citation] Through its \nincorporation of the tax code provision into the plan, Microsoft manifested an objective intent to make all \ncommon-law employees, and hence the plaintiffs, eligible for participation.

First, the label used in the instruments signed by the plaintiffs does not control \ntheir employment status. Second, the employment instruments, if construed to exclude the plaintiffs from \nreceiving ESPP benefits, would conflict with the plan’s express incorporation of § 423. Although Microsoft \nmay have generally intended to exclude individuals who were in fact independent contractors, it could \nnot, consistent with its express intention to extend participation in the ESPP to all common-law \nemployees, have excluded the plaintiffs.

There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights. It is “well established” that an optionor may not rely on an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n403 \noptionee’s failure to exercise an option when he has committed any act or failed to perform any duty \n“calculated to cause the optionee to delay in exercising the right.” [Citation] “[T]he optionor may not \nmake statements or representations calculated to cause delay, [or] fail to furnish [necessary] \ninformation.…” Similarly, “[I]t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause \nof the failure of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own \nliability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.” [Citation]… \n \nApplying these principles, we agree with the magistrate judge, who concluded that Microsoft, which \ncreated a benefit to which the plaintiffs were entitled, could not defend itself by arguing that the plaintiffs \nwere unaware of the benefit, when its own false representations precluded them from gaining that \nknowledge. Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer.

It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays.

This condition persisted until the morning of June 9, 1971 when according to the claimant, Mr. \nGorman looked much better and even smiled and ‘tousled her hair’ when she so remarked. \n \nA short time later Mr. Gorman called her on the intercom and asked her to call the police to room 615. \nMrs. Wolfe complied with this request and then tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Gorman on the \nintercom.

He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business. The full extent of the manager’s authority \ndepends on the circumstances—what is customary in the particular industry, in the particular business, \nand among the individuals directly concerned. \n \nOn the other hand, a manager does not have implicit authority to undertake unusual or extraordinary \nactions on behalf of his principal. In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a \nnew logo for the hotel’s stationery. Andy has no implied authority to change the name or to commission \nthe artist, though he does have implied authority to engage a printer to replenish the stationery supply—\nand possibly to make some design changes in the letterhead.",

A million-dollar industrial accident is \nwithin the means of a company or its insurer; it is usually not within the means of the agent—employee—\nwho caused it. \n \nThe “deep pocket” of the defendant-company is not always very deep, however. For many small \nbusinesses, in fact, the principle of respondeat superior is one of life or death. One example was the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n425 \nclosing in San Francisco of the much-beloved Larraburu Brothers Bakery—at the time, the world’s second \nlargest sourdough bread maker. The bakery was held liable for $2 million in damages after one of its \ndelivery trucks injured a six-year-old boy. The bakery’s insurance policy had a limit of $1.25 million, and \nthe bakery could not absorb the excess. The Larraburus had no choice but to cease operations. \n(Seehttp://www.outsidelands.org/larraburu.php.) \n \nRespondeat superior raises three difficult questions: (1) What type of agents can create tort liability for \nthe principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors. The plumber who rushes to a client’s house to repair a leak and causes a traffic accident does \nnot subject the homeowner to liability. But there are exceptions to the rule. Generally, these exceptions",

Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a \npartially disclosed principal. Suppose the sellers get wind of the impending construction and want to back \nout of the deal. Who may enforce the contracts against them? \n \nThe developer and the agents may sue to compel transfer of title. The undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal may act to enforce his rights unless the contract specifically prohibits it or there is a \nrepresentation that the signatories are not signing for an undisclosed principal. The agents may also bring \nsuit to enforce the principal’s contract rights because, as agents for an undisclosed or partially disclosed \nprincipal, they are considered parties to their contracts. \n \nNow suppose the developer attempts to call off the deal. Whom may the sellers sue? Both the developer \nand the agents are liable. That the sellers had no knowledge of the developer’s identity—or even that there \nwas a developer—does not invalidate the contract. If the sellers first sue agent Betty (or Clem), they may \nstill recover the purchase price from the developer as long as they had no knowledge of his identity prior \nto winning the first lawsuit. The developer is discharged from liability if, knowing his identity, the \nplaintiffs persist in a suit against the agents and recover a judgment against them anyway. Similarly, if the \nseller sues the principal and recovers a judgment, the agents are relieved of liability.

The results of the test are not before us; however, we do know that \nafter the test was administered, Officer James apologized to Cockrell for arresting her, and he assured her \nthat he would prepare her paperwork so that she would not have to spend much time in jail. As they were \nleaving the Reservoir Patrol office, Officer James began asking Cockrell personal questions such as where \nshe lived, whether she was dating anyone and if she had a boyfriend. Officer James then asked Cockrell \nfor her cell phone number so that he could call and check on her. As they were approaching his patrol car \nfor the trip to the Rankin County jail, Officer James informed Cockrell that she should be wearing \nhandcuffs; however, he did not handcuff Cockrell, and he allowed her to ride in the front seat of the patrol \ncar with him. In route to the jail, Cockrell became emotional and started crying. As she was fixing her \nmakeup using the mirror on the sun visor, Officer James pulled his patrol car into a church parking lot \nand parked the car. He then pulled Cockrell towards him in an embrace and began stroking her back and \nhair telling her that things would be fine. Cockrell told Officer James to release her, but he continued to \nembrace her for approximately five minutes before continuing on to the jail. \n \nOn June 30, 1998, Cockrell returned to the Reservoir Patrol office to retrieve her driver’s license. Officer \nJames called Cockrell into his office and discussed her DUI charge with her. As she was leaving, Officer \nJames grabbed her from behind, turned her around, pinned both of her arms behind her and pulled her to \nhis chest. When Officer James bent down to kiss her, she ducked her head, thus causing Officer James to \ninstead kiss her forehead. When Officer James finally released Cockrell, she ran out of the door and drove \naway. [Subsequently, Cockrell’s attorney threatened civil suit against Patrol; James was fired in October \n1998.]",

Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order.

An amended UPA appeared in 1992, and \nfurther amendments were promulgated in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. The NCCUL reports that thirty-\nnine states have adopted some version of the revised act. This chapter will discuss the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) as promulgated in 1997, but because not all jurisdictions have not adopted it, \nwhere RUPA makes significant changes, the original 1914 UPA will also be considered. [2] The NCCUL \nobserves in its “prefatory note” to the 1997 act: “The Revised Act is largely a series of ‘default rules’ that \ngovern the relations among partners in situations they have not addressed in a partnership agreement. \nThe primary focus of RUPA is the small, often informal, partnership. Larger partnerships generally have a \npartnership agreement addressing, and often modifying, many of the provisions of the partnership act.” [3] \n \nEntity Theory \nMeaning of “Legal Entity” \nA significant difference between a partnership and most other kinds of business organization relates to \nwhether, and the extent to which, the business is a legal entity. A legal entity is a person or group that the \nlaw recognizes as having legal rights, such as the right to own and dispose of property, to sue and be sued, \nand to enter into contracts; the entity theory is the concept of a business firm as a legal person, with \nexistence and accountability separate from its owners. When individuals carry out a common enterprise \nas partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said \nno. In other words, under the common-law theory, a partnership was but a convenient name for an \naggregate of individuals, and the rights and duties recognized and imposed by law are those of the \nindividual partners. By contrast, the mercantile theory of the law merchant held that a partnership is a \nlegal entity that can have rights and duties independent of those of its members. \n \nDuring the drafting of the 1914 UPA, a debate raged over which theory to adopt. The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460",

According to the NCCUL, “The Revised Act \nenhances the entity treatment of partnerships to achieve simplicity for state law purposes, particularly in \nmatters concerning title to partnership property. RUPA does not, however, relentlessly apply the entity \napproach. The aggregate approach is retained for some purposes, such as partners’ joint and several \nliability.” [4] Section 201(a) provides, “A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.” [5] \nEntity Characteristics of a Partnership \nUnder RUPA, then, a partnership has entity characteristics, but the partners remain guarantors of \npartnership obligations, as always—that is the partners’ joint and several liability noted in the previous \nparagraph (and discussed further in Chapter 12 \"Partnership Operation and Termination\"). This is a very \nimportant point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them \nis, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes \npersonal and unlimited liability. This personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished, \nsubject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and limited liability companies, as discussed \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". And, of course, the owners of corporations are also not generally \nliable for the corporation’s obligations, which is a major reason for the corporate form’s popularity. \n \nFor Accounting Purposes \nUnder both versions of the law, the partnership may keep business records as if it were a separate entity, \nand its accountants may treat it as such for purposes of preparing income statements and balance sheets. \n \nFor Purposes of Taxation \nUnder both versions of the law, partnerships are not taxable entities, so they do not pay income taxes. \nInstead, each partner’s distributive share, which includes income or other gain, loss, deductions, and",

The latter provides that “property originally brought into the \npartnership stock or subsequently acquired by purchase…on account of the partnership, is partnership \nproperty.” [10] Under either law, a partner may bring onto the partnership premises her own property, not \nacquired in the name of the partnership or with its credit, and it remains her separate property. Under \nneither law can a partner unilaterally dispose of partnership property, however labeled, for the obvious \nreason that one cannot dispose of another’s property or property rights without permission.

Partnership law goes back a long way, but in \nthe United States, most states—but not all—have adopted the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA, 1997) \nover the previous Uniform Partnership Act, originally promulgated in 1914. One salient change made by RUPA \nis to directly announce that a partnership is an entity: it is like a person for purposes of accounting, litigation, \nbankruptcy, and owning real estate. Partnerships do not pay taxes; the individual partners do. But in practical \nterms, what RUPA does is codify already-existing state law on these matters, and partners are free to organize \ntheir relationship as they like in the partnership agreement. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

For example, Carlos decides to paint houses during his summer break. He gathers some \nmaterials and gets several jobs. He hires Wally as a helper. Wally is very good, and pretty soon both of \nthem are deciding what jobs to do and how much to charge, and they are splitting the profits. They have \nan implied partnership, without intending to create a partnership at all. \n \nTests of Partnership Existence \nBut how do we know whether an implied partnership has been created? Obviously, we know if there is an \nexpress agreement. But partnerships can come into existence quite informally, indeed, without any \nformality—they can be created accidentally. In contrast to the corporation, which is the creature of \nstatute, partnership is a catchall term for a large variety of working relationships, and frequently, \nuncertainties arise about whether or not a particular relationship is that of partnership. The law can \nreduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price of severely restricting the flexibility of people to \nassociate. As the chief drafter of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA, 1914) explained, \n \nAll other business associations are statutory in origin. They are formed by the happening of an \nevent designated in a statute as necessary to their formation. In corporations this act may be the \nissuing of a charter by the proper officer of the state; in limited partnerships, the filing by the \nassociates of a specified document in a public office. On the other hand, an infinite number of \ncombinations of circumstances may result in co-ownership of a business.

Section 202(c) of RUPA provides that “a person who \nreceives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business,” but this \npresumption can be rebutted by showing that the share of the profits paid out was (1) to repay a debt; (2) \nwages or compensation to an independent contractor; (3) rent; (4) an annuity, retirement, or health \nbenefit to a representative of a deceased or retired partner; (5) interest on a loan, or rights to income, \nproceeds, or increase in value from collateral; or (5) for the sale of the goodwill of a business or other \nproperty.

A primary test of whether a partnership exists is whether there is a sharing of profits, though other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n471 \nfactors such as sharing decision making, sharing liabilities, and how the business is operated are also \nexamined. \nMost partnerships are expressly created. Several factors become important in the partnership agreement, \nwhether written or oral. These include the name of the business, the capital contributions of each partner, \nprofit sharing, and decision making. But a partnership can also arise by implication or by estoppel, where one \nhas held herself as a partner and another has relied on that representation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

In essence, a \njoint venture is a “temporary partnership.” In the United States, the use of joint ventures began with the railroads \nin the late 1800s. Throughout the middle part of the twentieth century joint ventures were common in the \nmanufacturing sector. By the late 1980s, they increasingly appeared in both manufacturing and service industries \nas businesses looked for new, competitive strategies. They are aggressively promoted on the Internet: “Joint \nVentures are in, and if you’re not utilizing this strategic weapon, chances are your competition is, or will soon be, \nusing this to their advantage.…possibly against you!” (Scott Allen, “Joint Venturing 101,” About.com \nEntrepreneurs,http://entrepreneurs.about.com/od/beyondstartup/a/jointventures.htm).As a risk-avoiding device, \nthe joint venture allows two or more firms to pool their differing expertise so that neither needs to “learn the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n472 \nropes” from the beginning; neither needs the entire capital to start the enterprise. Partnership rules generally \napply, although the relationship of the joint venturers is closer to that of special than general agency as discussed \nin Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\".

The joint venture need have no \ngroup name, though it may have one. Property may be owned jointly. Profits and losses will be shared, as in a \npartnership, and each associate has the right to participate in management. Liability is unlimited. Sometimes two \nor more businesses will form a joint venture to carry out a specific task—prospecting for oil, building a nuclear \nreactor, doing basic scientific research—and will incorporate the joint venture. In that case, the resulting \nbusiness—known as a “joint venture corporation”—is governed by corporation law, not the law of partnership, \nand is not a joint venture in the sense described here. Increasingly, companies are forming joint ventures to do \nbusiness abroad; foreign investors or governments own significant interests in these joint ventures. For example, \nin 1984 General Motors entered into a joint venture with Toyota to revive GM’s shuttered Fremont, California, \nassembly plant to create New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). For GM the joint venture was an \nopportunity to learn about lean manufacturing from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first \nmanufacturing base in North America and a chance to test its production system in an American labor \nenvironment. Until May 2010, when the copartnership ended and the plant closed, NUMMI built an average of six \nthousand vehicles a week, or nearly eight million cars and trucks. These vehicles were the Chevrolet Nova (1984–\n88), the Geo Prizm (1989–97), the Chevrolet Prizm (1998–2002), and the Hilux (1991–95, predecessor of the \nTacoma), as well as the Toyota Voltz, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Pontiac Vibe.

Employment Security Commission \n274 A.2d 707 (Del. 1971) \n \nSTOREY, J. \n \nThe Employment Security Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, levied an involuntary \nassessment against Richard K. Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important. Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade. The paragraph also declared that upon \ndissolution of the partnership, ownership of items would revert to the party providing them. The third \nparagraph declared that the income of the partnership would be divided 30% for Chaiken, 70% for",

On the other hand, distribution of partnership assets to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n475 \npartners upon dissolution is only allowed after all partnership liabilities are satisfied. But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent, \ncoupled with the absence of profit sharing, they become strong factors in discrediting the partnership \nargument. Such weighing of the elements against a partnership finding compares favorably with Fenwick \nv. Unemployment Compensation Commission, which decided against the partnership theory on similar \nfacts, including the filing of partnership income tax forms. \n \nIn addition, the total circumstances of the case taken together indicate the employer-employee \nrelationship between Chaiken and his barbers. The agreement set forth the hours of work and days off—\nunusual subjects for partnership agreements. The barbers brought into the relationship only the \nequipment required of all barber shop operators. And each barber had his own individual “partnership”",

He made an oral \nagreement with Frances Cutler, who had been working for him as a bartender, that she take over the \nmanagement of the club. She was to have the authority and the responsibility for the entire active \nmanagement and operation: to purchase the supplies, pay the bills, keep the books, hire and fire \nemployees, and do whatever else was necessary to run the business.

Partners are fiduciaries as \nto each other and as to the partnership, and as such, they owe a fiduciary duty to each other and the \npartnership. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty “something \nstricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most \nsensitive, is then the standard of behavior.” [3]Breach of the fiduciary duty gives rise to a claim for \ncompensatory, consequential, and incidental damages; recoupment of compensation; and—rarely—\npunitive damages. See Section 12.4.1 \"Breach of Partnership Fiduciary Duty\", Gilroy v. Conway, for an \nexample of breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n \nApplication of the Fiduciary Standard to Partnership Law \nUnder UPA, all partners are fiduciaries of each other—they are all principals and agents of each other—\nthough the word fiduciary was not used except in the heading to Section 21. The section reads, “Every \npartner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by \nhim without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, \nconduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.” \n \nSection 404 of RUPA specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other \npartners. It imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three circumstances: \n \n(1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived \nby the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use \nby the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership \nopportunity; \n \n(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership \nbusiness as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n494 \n(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business \nbefore the dissolution of the partnership.",

Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”?

Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404.

The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights.

It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty? Section 28 of UPA and RUPA Section 504 permit a judgment creditor to obtain \na charging order, which charges the partner’s interest in the partnership with obligation to satisfy the \njudgment. The court may appoint a receiver to ensure that partnership proceeds are paid to the judgment \ncreditor. But the creditor is not entitled to specific partnership property.

Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them.

That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners.

Explain the winding up of partnerships under UPA and RUPA. \n \n \nIt is said that a partnership is like a marriage, and that extends to its ending too. It’s easier to get into a \npartnership than it is to get out of it because legal entanglements continue after a person is no longer a \npartner. The rules governing “getting out” of a partnership are different under the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) than under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). We take up UPA first. \n \nDissolution of Partnerships under UPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n512 \nDissolution, in the most general sense, means a separation into component parts. \n \nMeaning of Dissolution under UPA \nPeople in business are sometimes confused about the meaning of dissolution. It does not mean the \ntermination of a business. It has a precise legal definition, given in UPA Section 29: “The dissolution of a \npartnership is the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in \nthe carrying on as distinguished from the winding up of the business.” The partnership is not necessarily \nterminated on dissolution; rather, it continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed, \nand the remaining partners may choose to continue on as a new partnership if they want. [1] But, again, \nunder UPA the partnership dissolves upon the withdrawal of any partner. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nPartnerships can dissolve for a number of reasons. [2] \n \nIn Accordance with the Agreement \nThe term of the partnership agreement may have expired or the partnership may be at will and one of the \npartners desires to leave it. All the partners may decide that it is preferable to dissolve rather than to \ncontinue. One of the partners may have been expelled in accordance with a provision in the agreement. In \nnone of these circumstances is the agreement violated, though its spirit surely might have been. Professor \nSamuelson calls to mind the example of William Dean Howells’s Silas Lapham, who forces his partner to \nsell out by offering him an ultimatum: “You may buy me out or I’ll buy you out.” The ultimatum was given",

[5] Notwithstanding the latter exception, no partner can \nbind the partnership if it has dissolved because it has become unlawful to carry on the business or if the \npartner seeking to exercise authority has become bankrupt. \n \nAfter Dissolution \nAfter a partnership has dissolved, it can follow one of two paths. It can carry on business as a new \npartnership, or it can wind up the business and cease operating (see Figure 12.2 \"Alternatives Following \nUPA Dissolution\"). \n \nFigure 12.2 Alternatives Following UPA Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n514 \n \nForming a New Partnership \nIn order to carry on the business as a new partnership, there must be an agreement—preferably as part of \nthe original partnership agreement but maybe only after dissolution (and maybe oral)—that upon \ndissolution (e.g., if a partner dies, retires, or quits) the others will regroup and carry on. \n \nUnder UPA the remaining partners have the right to carry on when (1) the dissolution was in \ncontravention of the agreement, (2) a partner was expelled according to the partnership agreement, or (3) \nall partners agree to carry on. [6] \n \nWhether the former partner dies or otherwise quits the firm, the noncontinuing one or his, her, or its legal \nrepresentative is entitled to an accounting and to be paid the value of the partnership interest, less \ndamages for wrongful dissolution. [7] The firm may need to borrow money to pay the former partner or her \nestate; or, in the case of a deceased partner, the money to pay the former partner is obtained through a life \ninsurance buyout policy. \n \nPartnerships routinely insure the lives of the partners, who have no ownership interests in the insurance \npolicies. The policies should bear a face amount equal to each partner’s interest in the partnership and \nshould be adjusted as the fortunes of the partnership change. Proceeds of the insurance policy are used on \ndeath to pay the purchase price of the interest inherited by the deceased’s estate. If the insurance policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n515 \npays out more than the interest at stake, the partnership retains the difference. If the policy pays out less, \nthe partnership agrees to pay the difference in installments. \n \nAnother set of issues arises when the partnership changes because an old partner departs and a new one \njoins.

[22] A dissociated partner \ncan sue the firm to determine the buyout price and the court may assess attorney’s, appraiser’s, and \nexpert’s fees against a party the court finds “acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or in bad faith.”[23] \n \nWinding Up the Partnership under UPA and RUPA \nIf the partners decide not to continue the business upon dissolution, they are obliged to wind up the \nbusiness. The partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business, \nafter which it is terminated. [24]Winding up entails concluding all unfinished business pending at the \ndate of dissolution and payment of all debts. The partners must then settle accounts among themselves in \norder to distribute the remaining assets. At any time after dissolution and before winding up is completed, \nthe partners (except a wrongfully dissociated one) can stop the process and carry on the business. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n521 \n \nUPA and RUPA are not significantly different as to winding up, so they will be discussed together. Two \nissues are discussed here: who can participate in winding up and how the assets of the firm are distributed \non liquidation. \n \nWho Can Participate in Winding Up \nThe partners who have not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership \nbusiness. On application of any partner, a court may for good cause judicially supervise the winding up.

For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and \nfinally (4) to partners for their share of profits (see Figure 12.3 \"Priority Partnership Liabilities under \nRUPA\").

Because there was no contract basis for dissolution, Horizon’s assertion of \ndissolution was wrongful, Southern Oaks concludes. \n \nSouthern Oaks contends further that not only were there no contractual grounds for dissolution, \ndissolution was also wrongful under the Florida Statutes. Southern Oaks argues that pursuant to section \n[of that statute] Horizon had the power to dissociate from the partnership, but, in the absence of contract \ngrounds for the dissociation, Horizon wrongfully dissociated. It asserts that it is entitled to lost future \nprofits under Florida’s partnership law.… \n \nWe find Southern Oaks’ argument without merit.

Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability, partnerships \nthe inestimable benefit of limited taxation. Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their \ntaxation. \n \nAt base, whether to allow businesspeople and investors to grasp the holy grail of limited liability is a \npolitical issue. When we say a person is “irresponsible,” it means he (or she, or it) does not take \nresponsibility for his harmful actions; the loss is borne by others. Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment.

The preface to ULPA-\n2001 explains, “In a limited liability limited partnership (‘LLLP’), no partner—whether general or \nlimited—is liable on account of partner status for the limited partnership’s obligations. Both general and \nlimited partners benefit from a full, status-based liability shield that is equivalent to the shield enjoyed by \ncorporate shareholders, LLC members, and partners in an LLP.” \n \nPresumably, most existing limited partnerships will switch over to LLLPs.

Many government \nprograms reflect peoples’ interest in adverting risk: federal deposit insurance, Social Security, and \nbankruptcy, to name three. And of course corporate limited liability has existed for two hundred \nyears.

The partnership form imposes serious potential risk: \nunlimited personal liability. The corporate form eliminates that risk but imposes some onerous formalities and \ndouble taxation. Early on, then, the limited partnership form was born, but it still imposed unlimited liability \non the general partner and on the limited partner if she became too actively involved. Congress was induced \nin the mid-1950s to allow certain small US corporations the right to single taxation, but the sub-S corporation \nstill suffered from various limitations on its structure. In the 1980s, the limited liability company was invented; \nit has become the entity of choice for many businesspeople, but its availability for professionals was limited. \nIn the late 1980s, the limited liability partnership form gained favor, and in the early 2000s, the limited liability \nlimited partnership finished off unlimited liability for limited partnerships. \n \nEXERCISES",

That section states \n(with emphasis as supplied in the plaintiff’s motion) that: \n \na partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not liable directly or indirectly, including \nby way of indemnification, contribution or otherwise, for any debts, obligations and liabilities of \nor chargeable to the partnership or another partner or partners, whether arising in \ncontract, tort, or otherwise, arising in the course of the partnership business while the \npartnership is a registered limited liability partnership. (emphasis in original) \n \nWhile italicizing the phases that appear to suit his purposes, the plaintiff completely ignores the most \nimportant phrase: “a partner in a registered limited liability partnership.” At the hearing, neither party \npresented any evidence at the hearing that tended to prove that the nature of the business relationship \nbetween the parties was that of a “registered limited liability partnership.” To the contrary, the testimony \npresented at the hearing revealed that the parties had a general partnership in which they had orally \nagreed to share profits and losses equally and that they never signed a partnership agreement. There was \ncertainly no testimony or tangible evidence to the effect that the partnership had filed “a certificate of \nlimited liability partnership with the Secretary of the State, stating the name of the partnership, which \nshall conform to the requirements of [the statute]; the address of its principal office;…a brief statement of \nthe business in which the partnership engages; any other matters the partnership may determine to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n578",

Comprehend the historical significance of corporate formation. \n2. Learn about key court decisions and their effect on interstate commerce and corporate formation. \n3. Become acquainted with how states formed their corporate laws. \n \n \nA Fixture of Every Major Legal System \nLike partnership, the corporation is an ancient concept, recognized in the Code of Hammurabi, and to \nsome degree a fixture in every other major legal system since then. The first corporations were not \nbusiness enterprises; instead, they were associations for religious and governmental ends in which \nperpetual existence was a practical requirement. Thus until relatively late in legal history, kings, popes, \nand jurists assumed that corporations could be created only by political or ecclesiastical authority and that \ncorporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more",

But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises.

Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589",

The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by \nDelaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present \nday there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an \naddress on file with the secretary of state in Dover. \n \nDuring the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform \nBusiness Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws. About half of the states have adopted all or major portions of the act. The \n2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to \nthroughout our discussion of corporation law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of \nfinancial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-\nseventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England.

Yet the Supreme Court \nrecently affirmed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) that the government may not \nsuppress the First Amendment right of political speech because the speaker is a corporation rather than a \nnatural person. According to the Court, “No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the \npolitical speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” [1] \n \nThe courts have also concluded that corporations are entitled to the essential constitutional protections of \ndue process and equal protection.

For example, corporations do not have the \nprivilege against self-incrimination guaranteed for natural persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation. As we explore \nin Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign Corporations, and \nCorporate Dissolution\", corporations are not citizens under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the \nConstitution, so that the states can discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations. And the \ncorporation is not entitled to federal review of state criminal convictions, as are many individuals. \n \nPiercing the Corporate Veil \nGiven the importance of the corporate entity as a veil that limits shareholder liability, it is important to \nnote that in certain circumstances, the courts may reach beyond the wall of protection that divides a \ncorporation from the people or entities that exist behind it. This is known \nas piercing the corporate veil, and it will occur in two instances: (1) when the corporation is used to \ncommit a fraud or an injustice and (2) when the corporation does not act as if it were one. \n \nFraud \nThe Felsenthal Company burned to the ground.

Its president, one of the company’s largest creditors and \nalso virtually its sole owner, instigated the fire. The corporation sued the insurance company to recover \nthe amount for which it was insured. According to the court in the Felsenthal case, “The general rule of \nlaw is that the willful burning of property by a stockholder in a corporation is not a defense against the \ncollection of the insurance by the corporation, and…the corporation cannot be prevented from collecting \nthe insurance because its agents willfully set fire to the property without the participation or authority of \nthe corporation or of all of the stockholders of the corporation.” [3] But because the fire was caused by the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n596 \nbeneficial owner of “practically all” the stock, who also “has the absolute management of [the \ncorporation’s] affairs and its property, and is its president,” the court refused to allow the company to \nrecover the insurance money; allowing the company to recover would reward fraud. [4] \n \nFailure to Act as a Corporation \nIn other limited circumstances, individual stockholders may also be found personally liable. Failure to \nfollow corporate formalities, for example, may subject stockholders to personal liability. This is a \nspecial risk that small, especially one-person, corporations run. Particular factors that bring this rule into \nplay include inadequate capitalization, omission of regular meetings, failure to record minutes of \nmeetings, failure to file annual reports, and commingling of corporate and personal assets. Where these \nfactors exist, the courts may look through the corporate veil and pluck out the individual stockholder or \nstockholders to answer for a tort, contract breach, or the like. The classic case is the taxicab operator who \nincorporates several of his cabs separately and services them through still another corporation. If one of \nthe cabs causes an accident, the corporation is usually “judgment proof” because the corporation will have \nfew assets (practically worthless cab, minimum insurance). The courts frequently permit plaintiffs to \nproceed against the common owner on the grounds that the particular corporation was inadequately \nfinanced. \n \nFigure 14.2 The Subsidiary as a Corporate Veil",

Bestfoods, (see Section 14.7.2 \"Piercing the Corporate Veil\"). \n \nOther Types of Personal Liability \nEven when a corporation is formed for a proper purpose and is operated as a corporation, there are \ninstances in which individual shareholders will be personally liable. For example, if a shareholder \ninvolved in company management commits a tort or enters into a contract in a personal capacity, he will \nremain personally liable for the consequences of his actions. In some states, statutes give employees \nspecial rights against shareholders. For example, a New York statute permits employees to recover wages, \nsalaries, and debts owed them by the company from the ten largest shareholders of the corporation. \n(Shareholders of public companies whose stock is traded on a national exchange or over the counter are \nexempt.) Likewise, federal law permits the IRS to recover from the “responsible persons” any withholding \ntaxes collected by a corporation but not actually paid over to the US Treasury. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have some of the legal rights of a natural person. They are entitled to the constitutional \nprotections of due process and equal protection, Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search \nand seizure, and First Amendment protection of free speech and expression.

It is often called a municipal corporation, to \ndistinguish it from the publicly held corporation, which is sometimes also referred to as a “public” \ncorporation, although it is in fact private (i.e., it is not governmental). Major cities and counties, and many \ntowns, villages, and special governmental units, such as sewer, transportation, and public utility \nauthorities, are incorporated. These corporations are not organized for profit, do not have shareholders, \nand operate under different statutes than do business corporations. \n \nProfessional Corporations \nUntil the 1960s, lawyers, doctors, accountants, and other professionals could not practice their \nprofessions in corporate form. This inability, based on a fear of professionals’ being subject to the \ndirection of the corporate owners, was financially disadvantageous. Under the federal income tax laws \nthen in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During \nthe 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax \nbenefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a professional corporation just as it would \nany other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of \ntax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension.

The term used for the \ndocument varies from state to state. Most states call the basic document filed in the appropriate public \noffice the “articles of incorporation” or “certificate of incorporation,” but there are other variations. There \nis no legal significance to these differences in terminology. \n \nChartering is basically a state prerogative. Congress has chartered several enterprises, including national \nbanks (under the National Banking Act), federal savings and loan associations, national farm loan \nassociations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract.

But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate.

For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed.

Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed.

Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance.

For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles of incorporation typically include the \nfollowing: the corporate name; the address of the corporation’s initial registered office; the period of the \ncorporation’s duration (usually perpetual); the company’s purposes; the total number of shares, the \nclasses into which they are divided, and the par value of each; the limitations and rights of each class of \nshareholders; the authority of the directors to establish preferred or special classes of stock; provisions for \npreemptive rights; provisions for the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation, including any \nprovision restricting the transfer of shares; the number of directors constituting the initial board of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n606 \ndirectors and the names and addresses of initial members; and the name and address of each \nincorporator.

(And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily.

The “materially affecting” requirement is not an identification \nof the boundaries of corporate speech etched by the Constitution itself.

Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1.

Towards this purpose he met with other interested individuals \nand an attorney and agreed to purchase stock and become an officer and director. Thereafter, upon being \nadvised by the attorney that the corporation had been formed under the laws of Maryland, he paid for and \nreceived a stock certificate evidencing ownership of shares in the corporation, and was shown the \ncorporate seal and minute book. The business of the new venture was conducted as if it were a \ncorporation, through corporate bank accounts, with auditors maintaining corporate books and records, \nand under a lease entered into by the corporation for the office from which it operated its business. \nCranson was elected president and all transactions conducted by him for the corporation, including the \ndealings with I.B.M., were made as an officer of the corporation. At no time did he assume any personal \nobligation or pledge his individual credit to I.B.M.

Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups.

Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions.

Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation. The court found that Mrs. Pritchard’s being on the board because she \nwas the spouse was insufficient to excuse her behavior, and that had she been performing her duties, she \ncould have prevented the bankruptcy. [6] \n \nDespite the fiduciary requirements, in reality a director does not spend all his time on corporate affairs, is \nnot omnipotent, and must be permitted to rely on the word of others. Nor can directors be infallible in \nmaking decisions. Managers work in a business environment, in which risk is a substantial factor. No \ndecision, no matter how rigorously debated, is guaranteed. Accordingly, courts will not second-guess \ndecisions made on the basis of good-faith judgment and due care. This is the business judgment rule, \nmentioned in previous chapters. The business judgment rule was coming into prominence as early as 1919 \nin Dodge v. Ford, discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". It has been a pillar of \ncorporate law ever since. As described by the Delaware Supreme Court: “The business judgment rule is an \nacknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of Delaware directors.…It is a presumption that in \nmaking a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in",

It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits.

The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy.

For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations.

In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts.

For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance).

Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club.

The plaintiff \nwrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either \nletter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected. Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate \npollings of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative \nproposals for amending the bylaws of corporation concerning the admission of women members and \nguests. None of these proposed amendments to the bylaws received the required number of votes for \nadoption. Following that balloting, the plaintiff again wrote to the president of the corporation and asked \nthat the directors stop interfering with his rights as a member to bring women guests to the luncheon \nfacility and to propose women for membership.

A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. A failure to act in good faith may be \nshown, for instance, where the fiduciary intentionally acts with a purpose other than that of advancing the \nbest interests of the corporation, where the fiduciary acts with the intent to violate applicable positive law, \nor where the fiduciary intentionally fails to act in the face of a known duty to act, demonstrating a \nconscious disregard for his duties. There may be other examples of bad faith yet to be proven or alleged, \nbut these three are the most salient. \n \n…Second, the legislature has also recognized this intermediate category of fiduciary misconduct, which \nranks between conduct involving subjective bad faith and gross negligence. Section 102(b)(7)(ii) of the \nDGCL expressly denies money damage exculpation for “acts or omissions not in good faith or which \ninvolve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.” By its very terms that provision \ndistinguishes between “intentional misconduct” and a “knowing violation of law” (both examples of \nsubjective bad faith) on the one hand, and “acts…not in good faith,” on the other. Because the statute \nexculpates directors only for conduct amounting to gross negligence, the statutory denial of exculpation \nfor “acts…not in good faith” must encompass the intermediate category of misconduct captured by the \nChancellor’s definition of bad faith. \n \nFor these reasons, we uphold the Court of Chancery’s definition as a legally appropriate, although not the \nexclusive, definition of fiduciary bad faith.

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares.

To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number.

The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v.

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts.

The catalogs were designed in New York, but were actually printed in Atlanta, \nBoston, and Oklahoma City. From these locations, 82% of the catalogs were directly mailed to residents of \nLouisiana; the remainder of the catalogs was mailed to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, or \nwas sent to Holmes for distribution at its flagship store on Canal Street in New Orleans. The catalogs were \nshipped free of charge to the addressee, and their entire cost (about $ 2 million for the 3-year period), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n767 \nincluding mailing, was borne by Holmes. Holmes did not, however, pay any sales tax where the catalogs \nwere designed or printed. \n \nAlthough the merchandise catalogs were mailed to selected customers, they contained instructions to the \npostal carrier to leave them with the current resident if the addressee had moved, and to return \nundeliverable catalogs to Holmes’ Canal Street store.

We have no doubt that the \nsecond and third elements of the test are satisfied. The Louisiana taxing scheme is fairly apportioned, for \nit provides a credit against its use tax for sales taxes that have been paid in other States. Holmes paid no \nsales tax for the catalogs where they were designed or printed; if it had, it would have been eligible for a \ncredit against the use tax exacted. Similarly, Louisiana imposed its use tax only on the 82% of the catalogs \ndistributed in-state; it did not attempt to tax that portion of the catalogs that went to out-of-state \ncustomers. \n \nThe Louisiana tax structure likewise does not discriminate against interstate commerce.

To be sure, many others in the State benefit from the same services; but that does not \nalter the fact that the use tax paid by Holmes, on catalogs designed to increase sales, is related to the \nadvantages provided by the State which aid Holmes’ business. \n \nFinally, we believe that Holmes’ distribution of its catalogs reflects a substantial nexus with Louisiana.

This is accomplished by appealing directly to the target company’s shareholders. \nIn the case of a large publicly held corporation, the appeal is known as a tender offer, which is not an offer \nbut an invitation to shareholders to tender their stock at a stated price.

They fell into disuse after the collapse of the Roman Empire and \nthen reappeared in Italy around the fourteenth century. They became more common as long-distance \ncommerce spread. In an era before paper currency, payment in coins or bullion was awkward, especially \nfor merchants who traveled great distances across national boundaries to attend the fairs at which most \neconomic exchanges took place. Merchants and traders found it far more efficient to pay with paper. \n \nBills of exchange, today commonly known as drafts, were recognized instruments in the law merchant. \n(The “law merchant” was the system of rules and customs recognized and adopted by early-modern \ntraders and is the basis of the UCC Article 3.) A draft is an unconditional order by one person (the drawer) \ndirecting another person (drawee or payor) to pay money to a named third person or to bearer; a check is \nthe most familiar type of draft.

The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law.

It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

By disclaiming contract \nliability, the qualified indorser also limits his warranty liabilities, though he does not eliminate them. \nSection 3-415(a) of the UCC narrows the indorser’s warranty that no defense of any party is good against \nthe indorser. In its place, the qualified indorser warrants merely that he has no knowledge of any defense. \n \n“Without recourse” indorsements can have a practical impact on the balance sheet. A company holding a \npromissory note can obtain cash by discounting it—indorsing it over to a bank for maturity value less the \nbank’s discount. As an indorser, however, the company remains liable to pay the amount to subsequent \nholders should the maker default at maturity. The balance sheet must reflect this possibility as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n823 \ncontingent liability. However, if the note is indorsed without recourse, the company need not account for \nany possible default of the maker as a contingent liability. \n \nThe dichotomy here between qualified and unqualified indorsements is the indorser’s way of indicating \nwhat liability she is willing to incur to subsequent holders. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY",

Section 3-404(c) provides that the indorsement of the imposter (Wright, posing \nas Steve Supplier) is effective. The same rule applies if the imposter poses as an agent: if the check is \npayable to Supplier, Inc., a company whose president is Steve Supplier, and an impostor impersonates \nSteve Supplier, the check could be negotiated if the imposter indorses it as Supplier, Inc.’s, agent “Steve \nSupplier.”[2] \n \nSimilarly, suppose Love is approached by a young man who says to her, “My company sells tennis balls, \nand we’re offering a special deal this month: a can of three high-quality balls for $2 each. We’ll send your \norder to you by UPS.” He hands her a sample ball: it is substantial, and the price is good. Love has heard \nof the company the man says he represents; she makes out a check for $100 to “Sprocket Athletic Supply.” \nThe young man does not represent the company at all, but he cashes the check by forging the indorsement \nand the bank pays.

No matter: Love signs the \ncheck in the amount of $2,000. Accountant takes the check and indorses it: “Carlos Aquino, pay to the \norder of Abby Accountant.” Then she signs her name as the next indorser and cashes the check at Love’s \nbank. The check is good, even though it was never intended by Accountant that “Carlos Aquino”—\nthe fictitious payee—have any interest in the instrument. The theory here is to “place the loss on the \ndrawer of the check rather than on the drawee or the Depositary Bank that took the check for \ncollection.…The drawer is in the best position to avoid the fraud and thus should take the loss.” [3] This is \nalso known as “the padded-payroll rule.” \n \nIn the imposter cases, Love drew checks made out to real names but gave them to the wrong person (the \nimposter); in the fictitious payee cases she wrote checks to a nonexistent person (or a real person who was \nnot intended to have any interest at all). \nThe Dishonest Employee Rule",

As explained in [Citation]: \nIn addition to accepting bets placed at parimutuel facility windows staffed by facility employees, \n[some] facilities use SAMS.

A transferee to whom a promissory note due April \n23 is negotiated on April 24 has notice that it was overdue and consequently is not an HDC. Not all paper \ncontains a due date for the entire amount, and demand paper has no due date at all. In Sections 3-\n302(a)(2) and 3-304, the UCC sets out specific rules dictating what is overdue paper. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Has Been Dishonored \nDishonor means that instrument is not paid when it is presented to the party who should pay it. \n \nWithout Notice of a Defense or Claim \nA purchaser of an instrument cannot be an HDC if he has notice that there are any defenses or claims \nagainst it. A defense is a reason why the would-be obligor will not pay; a claim is an assertion of \nownership in the instrument. If a person is fraudulently induced to issue or make an instrument, he has a \nclaim to its ownership and a defense against paying. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n859 \nWithout Notice of Unauthorized Signature or Alteration \nThis is pretty clear: a person will fail to achieve the HDC status if he has notice of alteration or an \nunauthorized signature. \n \nWithout Reason to Question the Instrument’s Authenticity Because of Apparent Forgery, \nAlteration, or Other Irregularity or Incompleteness as to Call into Question Its Authenticity",

On August 2, Betsy gives the note to Al as a token of her affection. Al is Clifford’s friend and knows \nabout the scam (see Figure 21.1 \"The Shelter Rule\"). May Al collect? \n \nFigure 21.1 The Shelter Rule \n \n \nBegin the analysis by noting that Al is not an HDC. Why? For three reasons: he did not take the \ninstrument for value (it was a gift), he did not take in good faith (he knew of the fraud), and he had notice \n(he acquired it after the due date). Nevertheless, Al is entitled to collect from Harold the full $250,000. \nHis right to do so flows from UCC, Section 3-203(b): “Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the \ntransfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, \nincluding any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due \ncourse by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument.” \n \nBy virtue of the shelter rule, Al as transferee from Betsy acquires all rights that she had as transferor. \nClearly Betsy is an HDC: she paid for the instrument, she took it in good faith, had no notice of any claim \nor defense against the instrument, and there were no apparent irregularities. Since Betsy is an HDC, so is \nAl. His knowledge of the fraud does not undercut his rights as HDC because he was not a party to it and \nwas not a prior holder. Now suppose that after negotiating the instrument to Betsy, Clifford repurchased \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n861 \nit from her. He would not be an HDC—and would not acquire all Betsy’s rights—because he had been a \nparty to fraud and as a prior holder had notice of a defense. The purpose of the shelter rule is “to assure \nthe holder in due course a free market for the paper.”[2] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine is important because it allows the holder of a negotiable instrument to take \nthe paper free from most claims and defenses against it. Without the doctrine, such a holder would be a mere \ntransferee. The UCC provides that to be an HDC, a person must be a holder of paper that is not suspiciously \nirregular, and she must take it in good faith, for value, and without notice of anything that a reasonable \nperson would recognize as tainting the instrument. A payee may be an HDC but usually would not be (because",

In any case, the person paying or taking the instrument may pay or collect \n“according to its original terms, or in the case of an incomplete instrument that is altered by unauthorized \ncompletion, according to its terms as completed. If blanks are filled or an incomplete instrument is \notherwise completed, subsection (c) places the loss upon the party who left the instrument incomplete by \npermitting enforcement in its completed form. This result is intended even though the instrument was \nstolen from the issuer and completed after the theft.” A moral here: don’t leave instruments lying around \nwith blanks that could be filled in. \n \nVoid Contract \nA void contract is distinguished from a voidable contract; only the former is a real defense. \n \nFraud in the Execution \nYou may recall that this is the rather unusual situation in which a person is tricked into signing a \ndocument. Able holds out a piece of paper for her boss and points to the signature line, saying, “This is a \nreceipt for goods we received a little while ago.” Baker signs it. It is not a receipt; it’s the signature line on \na promissory note. Able has committed fraud in the execution, and the note is void. \n \nDischarge of Which the Holder Has Notice \nIf the holder knows that the paper—a note, say—has already been paid, she cannot enforce it. That’s a \ngood reason to take back any note you have made from the person who presents it to you for payment. \n \nConsumer Transactions and Holders in Due Course \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine often worked considerable hardship on the consumer, usually as the \nmaker of an installment note. \n \nFor example, a number of students are approached by a gym owner who induces them to sign one-year \npromissory notes for $150 for a one-year gym membership. The owner says, “I know that right now the \nequipment in the gym is pretty rudimentary, but then, too, $150 is about half what you’d pay at the YMCA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n866 \nor Gold’s Gym.

So within several months we’ll have a fully equipped facility for your use.” \nSeveral students sign the notes, which the owner sells to a factor (one that lends money to another, \ntaking back a negotiable instrument as security, usually at about a 20 percent discount). The factor takes \nas an apparent HDC, but the gym idea doesn’t work and the owner declares bankruptcy. If this were a \ncommercial transaction, the makers (the students) would still owe on the notes even if there was, as here, \na complete failure of consideration (called “paying on a dead horse”). But the students don’t have to pay. \n \nWhether the gym owner here committed fraud is uncertain, but the holder-in-due-course doctrine did \noften work to promote fraud. Courts frequently saw cases brought by credit companies (factors) against \nconsumers who bought machines that did not work and services that did not live up to their promises. The \nancient concept of an HDC did not square with the realities of modern commerce, in which instruments \nby the millions are negotiated for uncompleted transactions. The finance company that bought such \ncommercial paper could never have honestly claimed (in the sociological sense) to be wholly ignorant that \nmany makers will have claims against their payees (though they could and did make the claim in the legal \nsense). \n \nActing to curb abuses, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1976 promulgated a trade regulation rule \nthat in effect abolished the holder-in-due-course rule for consumer credit transactions. Under the FTC \nrule titled “Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses,” [3] the creditor becomes a mere holder and \nstands in the shoes of the seller, subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the \nseller. Specifically, the rule requires the seller to provide notice in any consumer credit contract that the \ndebtor is entitled to raise defenses against any subsequent purchaser of the paper. It also bars the seller \nfrom accepting any outside financing unless the loan contract between the consumer and the outside \nfinance company contains a similar notice. (The required notice, to be printed in no less than ten-point, \nboldface type, is set out in Figure 21.3 \"Notice of Defense\".) The effect of the rule is to ensure that a",

Camp \n825 N.E.2d 644 (Ohio App. 2005) \n \nDonovan, J. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n872 \nDefendant-appellant Shawn Sheth appeals from a judgment of the Xenia Municipal Court in favor of \nplaintiff-appellee Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. (“Buckeye”). Sheth contends that the trial court erred in \nfinding that Buckeye was a holder in due course of a postdated check drawn by Sheth and therefore was \nentitled to payment on the instrument despite the fact that Sheth had issued a stop-payment order to his \nbank. \n \nIn support of this assertion, Sheth argues that the trial court did not use the correct legal standard in \ngranting holder-in-due-course status to Buckeye. In particular, Sheth asserts that the trial court used the \npre-1990 Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) definition of “good faith” as it pertains to holder-in-due-\ncourse status, which defined it as “honesty in fact.” The definition of “good faith” was extended by the \nauthors of the UCC in 1990 to also mean “the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair \ndealing.” The post-1990 definition was adopted by the Ohio legislature in 1994. \n \nSheth argues that while Buckeye would prevail under the pre-1990, “honesty in fact” definition of “good \nfaith,” it failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner when it chose to cash the postdated check \ndrawn by Sheth. The lower court…adjudged Buckeye to be a holder in due course and, therefore, entitled \nto payment. We conclude that the trial court used the incorrect “good faith” standard when it granted \nholder-in-due-course status to Buckeye because Buckeye did not act in a commercially reasonable manner \nwhen it cashed the postdated check drawn by Sheth. Because we accept Sheth’s sole assignment of error, \nthe judgment of the trial court is reversed. \n \nOn or about October 12, 2003, Sheth entered into negotiations with James A. Camp for Camp to provide \ncertain services to Sheth by October 15, 2003. To that end, Sheth issued Camp a check for $1,300. The \ncheck was postdated to October 15, 2003. \n \nOn October 13, 2003, Camp negotiated the check to Buckeye and received a payment of $1,261.31. \nApparently fearing that Camp did not intend to fulfill his end of the contract, Sheth contacted his bank on \nOctober 14, 2003, and issued a stop-payment order on the check. Unaware of the stop-payment order, \nBuckeye deposited the check with its own bank on October 14, 2003, believing that the check would reach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

[Citation] Under that standard, absent fraudulent behavior, an \notherwise innocent party was assumed to have acted in good faith. The “honesty in fact” requirement, also \nknown as the “pure heart and empty head” doctrine, is a subjective test under which a holder had to \nsubjectively believe he was negotiating an instrument in good faith for him to become a holder in due \ncourse. Maine [Citation, 1999]. \n \nIn 1994, however, the Ohio legislature amended the definition of “good faith” to include not only the \nsubjective “honesty in fact” test, but also an objective test: “the observance of reasonable commercial \nstandards of fair dealing.” Ohio UCC 1-201(20). A holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective \nand an objective test of good faith. What constitutes “reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing” for \nparties claiming holder-in-due-course status, however, has not heretofore been defined in the state of \nOhio. \n \nIn support of his contention that Buckeye is not a holder in due course, Sheth cites a decision from the \nSupreme Court of Maine, [referred to above] in which the court provided clarification with respect to the \nobjective prong of the “good faith” analysis: \n \n“The fact finder must therefore determine, first, whether the conduct of the holder comported with \nindustry or ‘commercial’ standards applicable to the transaction and second, whether those \nstandards were reasonable standards intended to result in fair dealing. Each of those \ndeterminations must be made in the context of the specific transaction at hand. If the fact finder’s \nconclusion on each point is ‘yes,’ the holder will be determined to have acted in good faith even if, \nin the individual transaction at issue, the result appears unreasonable.

Hauser Co. appeals the grant of summary judgment.…We affirm. \n \nIn October 1998, Alfred M. Hauser, president of Hauser Co., was notified by Edwards Food Store in \nRaritan and the Somerset Valley Bank (the Bank), that several individuals were cashing what appeared to \nbe Hauser Co. payroll checks. Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments. Mr. Hauser \nconcluded that the checks were counterfeits because none of the payees were employees of Hauser Co., \nand because he did not write the checks or authorize anyone to sign those checks on his behalf. At that \ntime, Hauser Co. employed Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

In support of his summary judgment motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit from each \ncompany; each company swore that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any \nclaims or defenses by any party, without knowledge that any of the signatures on the checks were \nunauthorized or fraudulent, and with the expectation that the checks would be paid upon their \npresentment to the bank upon which the checks were drawn. Hauser Co. does not dispute any of the facts \nsworn to by the check cashing companies. \n \nThe checks were then transferred to plaintiff in accordance with section 3-303, vesting plaintiff with \nholder in due course status. Each company swore that it assigned the checks to plaintiff in exchange for \nconsideration received from plaintiff. Plaintiff thus acquired the check cashing companies’ holder in due \ncourse status when the checks were assigned to plaintiff. Moreover, pursuant to section 3-403(a)’s \nrequirement that the transfer must have been made for the purpose of giving the transferee the right to \nenforce the instrument, the assignment agreements expressly provided plaintiff with that right, stating \nthat “all payments [assignor] may receive from any of the referenced Debtors…shall be the exclusive \nproperty of [assignee].” Again, Hauser Co. does not dispute any facts relating to the assignment of the \nchecks to plaintiff. \n \nHauser Co. contends, instead, that the checks are per se invalid because they were fraudulent and \nunauthorized. Presumably, this argument is predicated on section 3-302. This section states a person is \nnot a holder in due course if the instrument bears “apparent evidence of forgery or alteration” or is \notherwise “so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.” \n \nIn order to preclude liability from a holder in due course under section 3-302, it must be apparent on the \nface of the instrument that it is fraudulent. The trial court specifically found that Hauser Co. had provided \nno such evidence, stating that Hauser Co. had failed to show that there was anything about the \nappearance of the checks to place the check cashing company on notice that any check was not valid. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org",

Section 4-401 of the UCC says nobody is liable on an instrument unless the person signed it, and Section 4-\n403(a) provides that “an unauthorized signature is ineffective” (except as the signature of the unauthorized \nperson), so how could Hauser Co. be liable at all? And why did the court never discuss plaintiff’s contention \nthat the defendant “was negligent in failing to safeguard both its payroll checks and its authorized drawer’s \nfacsimile stamp”? \n3. Why didn’t the Hauser Co. specifically deny the authenticity of the signatures? \n4. Obviously, the plaintiff must have known that there was something wrong with the checks when he bought \nthem from the check-cashing companies: they had been dishonored and were marked “Stolen, do not \npresent again.” Did he present them again? \n5. While the UCC does not require that the transferee of an instrument acted in good faith in order to collect \non the instrument as an HDC (though he can’t have participated in any scam), it disallows a person from \nbeing an HDC if he takes an instrument with notice of dishonor. Surely the plaintiff had notice of that. What \ndoes the UCC require that transformed Mr. Triffin—via the shelter rule—into a person with the rights of an \nHDC? \n6. If the plaintiff had not purchased the checks from the check-cashing companies, who would have taken the \nloss here? \n7. What recourse does the defendant, Hauser Co., have now? \n8.

Recognize what a signature is under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Understand how a person’s signature on an instrument affects liability if the person is an agent, or a \npurported agent, for another. \n \n \nThe liability of an agent who signs commercial paper is one of the most frequently litigated issues in this \narea of law. For example, Igor is an agent (treasurer) of Frank N. Stein, Inc. Igor signs a note showing that \nthe corporation has borrowed $50,000 from First Bank. The company later becomes bankrupt. The \nquestion: Is Igor personally liable on the note? The unhappy treasurer might be sued by the bank—the \nimmediate party with whom he dealt—or by a third party to whom the note was transferred (see Figure \n22.1 \"Signature by Representative\"). \n \nFigure 22.1 Signature by Representative \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n890 \n \nThere are two possibilities regarding an agent who signs commercial paper: the agent was authorized to \ndo so, or the agent was not authorized to do so. First, though, what is a signature? \n \nA “Signature” under the Uniform Commercial Code \nSection 3-401 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides fairly straightforwardly that “a signature \ncan be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name, including \nany trade or assumed name, or by any word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person with the \npresent intention to authenticate a writing.” \n \nLiability of an Agent Who Has Authority to Sign \nAgents often sign instruments on behalf of their principals, and—of course—because a corporation’s \nexistence is a legal fiction (you can’t go up and shake hands with General Motors), corporations can only \nact through their agents.",

The drafters of the UCC here punt to the common law of agency: if, under agency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n891 \nlaw, the principal would be bound by the act of the agent, the signature is the authorized signature of the \nprincipal. And the general rule in agency law is that the agent is not liable if he signs his own name and \nmakes clear he is doing so as an agent. In our example, Igor should sign as follows: “Frank N. Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.” \n \nThe UCC provides that in each case, the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the \ninstrument without notice that the agent wasn’t intended to be liable on the instrument. As to any other \nperson (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she proves that the original parties to the \ninstrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Section 3-402(c) says that, as to a check, if an agent signs \nhis name without indicating agency status but the check has the principal’s identification on it (that would \nbe in the upper left corner), the authorized agent is not liable. \n \nLiability of an “Agent” Who Has No Authority to Sign \nA person who has no authority to sign an instrument cannot really be an “agent” because by definition an \nagent is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing with",

Rather, all that is required is that \nthe “person making presentment must…give reasonable identification.” § 3-501(b)(2). While providing a \nthumbprint signature does not necessarily confirm identification of the checkholder at presentment—\nunless of course the drawee bank has a duplicate thumbprint signature on file—it does assist in the \nidentification of the checkholder should the check later prove to be bad. It therefore serves as a powerful \ndeterrent to those who might otherwise attempt to pass a bad check.

The transfer of a check for consideration creates both transfer \nwarranties (§ 3-416(a) and (c)) and presentment warranties (§ 3-417(a) and (e)) which cannot be \ndisclaimed. The warranties include, for example, that the payee is entitled to enforce the instrument and \nthat there are no alterations on the check.

Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss.

The account agreement authorized PNC to charge back \nMartin’s account “even if the amount of the item has already been made available to you.” The account \nagreement, as a result, placed the risk of loss on Martin. Any mistake on PNC’s part was immaterial \nbecause PNC always had the right to charge back Martin’s account. [Citation] \n \nC. Martin’s Counterclaims \nMartin has asserted counterclaims for violations of various Uniform Commercial Code provisions; \nnegligence and failure to exercise ordinary care; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; detrimental reliance; conversion; and \nnegligent retention and supervision. Martin argues that “[t]o the extent that either party should be \nentitled to summary judgment in this case, it would be Martin with respect to his counterclaims against \nPNC.” Martin, however, has not moved for summary judgment on his counterclaims, and the court does \nnot address them on PNC’s motion. \n \nD. Damages \nPNC’s recovery under both theories of liability is contingent on PNC’s demonstrating that it acted in good \nfaith. PNC may recover for breach of the transfer warranties only if it took the check in good faith. § 3-\n416(b). Moreover, PNC must satisfy the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which Kentucky \nlaw incorporates in the account agreement.

The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card.

Under several provisions of Article 4, the bank is entitled to pay, \neven though the payment may be adverse to the customer’s interest. \n \nCommon Issues Arising between Banks and Their Customers \nPayment of Overdrafts \nSuppose a customer writes a check for a sum greater than the amount in her account. May the bank pay \nthe check and charge the customer’s account? Under Section 4-401(1), it may. Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n947 \n \nPayment of Deceased’s or Incompetent’s Checks \nSuppose a customer dies or is adjudged to be incompetent. May the bank honor her checks? Section 4-405 \npermits banks to accept, pay, and collect an item as long as it has no notice of the death or declaration of \nincompetence, and has no reasonable opportunity to act on it. Even after notice of death, a bank has ten \ndays to payor certify checks drawn on or prior to the date of death unless someone claiming an interest in \nthe account orders it to refrain from doing so. \n \n \n \nStop Payment Orders \nSection 4-403 expressly permits the customer to order the bank to “stop payment” on any check payable \nfor her account, assuming the stop order arrives in enough time to reasonably permit the bank to act on it. \nAn oral stop order is effective for fourteen days; a follow-up written confirmation within that time is \neffective for six months and can be renewed in writing.

(3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows. \n \n1. Proof of transaction. The electronic terminal itself must be equipped to provide a receipt of transfer, \nshowing date, amount, account number, and certain other information. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe bank or other financial institution must provide you with a monthly statement listing all \nelectronic transfers to and from the account, including transactions made over the computer or \ntelephone, and must show to whom payment has been made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n954 \n2. Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation. \n3. Recourse for loss or theft. If you notify the issuer of your EFT card within two business days after \nlearning that your card (or code number) is missing or stolen, your liability is limited to $50. If you \nfail to notify the issuer in this time, your liability can go as high as $500. More daunting is the \nprospect of loss if you fail within sixty days to notify the financial institution of an unauthorized \ntransfer noted on your statement: after sixty days of receipt, your liability is unlimited. In other \nwords, a thief thereafter could withdraw all your funds and use up your line of credit and you would \nhave no recourse against the financial institution for funds withdrawn after the sixtieth day, if you \nfailed to notify it of the unauthorized transfer. \n4. Mandatory use of EFT. Your employer or a government agency can compel you to accept a salary \npayment or government benefit by electronic transfer. But no creditor can insist that you repay",

Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to",

He recognized that the most popular\ninstructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for\nmany followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a “pack of bike\nriders,” familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The\ncompany name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.\nPeloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public\nwith an initial public offering in September 2019. Foley and his friends had the idea that they were a\n“purposeful music company” and needed to touch on all aspects of the workout experience including the\n3\nCatherine Cote. “How and Why Managers Use Financial Statements.” Business Insights.

Even though this is a business finance text,\nsometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, Table 1.2 demonstrates four different\ninvestment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account\nearning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost\ncertainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate\nroughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!\nCompare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per\nyear from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an\nannual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\nsaves money.\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\nacting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent\noversight.\nBernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\nhad been newly invested.\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\n(Sources: Diana B.

These ratings and\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\nfactors and performance.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\nevaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal\nimportance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per Figure 2.3 below. It is critical for the senior management\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\nwhen necessary.\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\ncompany. Because of the nature of these factors, firms that are rated with high ESG metrics are believed to\n2.4 • Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards\n53\nrepresent superior investments and to have proactive management teams focused on creating long-term\nvalue of company stock.\nThus, with investors increasingly using ESG scores to form their investment strategies, the consequences of a",

The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for\nsweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30.

In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity.

Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan.

If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced.

If a lender can earn\n1% lending to the US government, the lender will only be willing to lend to the riskier corporation if they can\nearn more than 1%. In Figure 3.18, the interest rates paid by very creditworthy companies is shown. The prime\nrate is the interest rate that banks charge their very best customers—large companies that are financially very\nstrong and have a very low risk of default.\nIt is generally riskier for a lender to make a loan to an individual than to a corporation. Individuals are more\nlikely to become ill, lose their job, or experience some other financial setback that makes it difficult for them to\nrepay their loans. In Figure 3.18, the interest rate on credit card loans is much higher than the interest rate\ncharged to corporate borrowers. That is because credit card loans are a high risk to the lender. Unlike other\nloans made to an individual, such as a car loan, the credit card company has no collateral if a consumer cannot\npay back the loan. With car loans, if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed money, the lender can repossess\nthe automobile and sell it to recoup some of the money it is owed. If you use a credit card to buy groceries and\ndo not repay the loan, the credit card company cannot repossess the groceries that you purchased. Therefore,\ncredit card loans have notoriously high interest rates to compensate the lender for the high risk.\nFigure 3.18 Interest Rate on US Treasury Bills and Credit Cards11 This graph shows the rates posted by a majority of top 25 (by\nassets in domestic offices) insured US-chartered commercial banks. The prime rate is one of several base rates used by banks to\nprice short-term business loans.

As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\nexposure. The ski lodge in Colorado will find that its customers from Mexico decrease when the dollar",

We will explore the components of the\naccounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\ndegree pursued.\nSolution:\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization.

It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other",

The ratio is reflected as a number,\nnot a percentage. A cash ratio of 1.0 means the firm has enough cash to cover all current liabilities if\nsomething happened and it was required to pay all current debts immediately. A ratio of less than 1.0 means\nthe firm has more current liabilities than it has cash on hand. A ratio of more than 1.0 means it has enough\ncash on hand to pay all current liabilities and still have cash left over. While a ratio greater than 1.0 may sound\nideal, it’s important to consider the specifics of the company. Sitting on idle cash is not ideal, as the cash could\nbe used to earn a return. And having a ratio less than 1.0 isn’t always bad, as many firms operate quite\nsuccessfully with a ratio of less than 1.0.

Compound\ninterest is the term we use to refer to interest income earned in subsequent periods that is based on interest\nincome earned in prior periods. To put it simply, compound interest refers to interest that is earned on\ninterest. Here, it refers to the $1.60 of interest earned in the second year on the $40.00 of interest earned in\nthe first year. Therefore, at the end of two years, the account would have a total value of $1,081.60. This\nconsists of the original principal of $1,000 plus the $40.00 interest income earned in year one and the $41.60\ninterest income earned in year two.\nThe amount of money your friend would have in the account at the end of two years, $1,081.60, is referred to\nas the future value of the original $1,000 amount deposited today in an account that will earn 4% interest every\nyear.\nSimple interest applies to year 1 while compound interest or “interest on interest” applies to year 2. This is\ncalculated using the following method:\nSo, the total amount that would be in the account after two years, at 4% annual interest, would be\n.\nTo determine any future value of money in an interest-bearing account, we multiply the principal amount by 1\nplus the interest rate for each year the money remains in the account.

Like all\nloans, RALs bear a rate of interest. Let’s assume that the firm that prepared your tax return determines that\nyou’re entitled to an $800 refund. Once they advance that amount to you, it will bear interest at a certain\nrate; we’ll assume 0.5% per week. You might expect a tax refund in four weeks. Half a percent of $800\ndoesn’t sound like much, but what happens when you annualize it into an effective rate, assuming your tax\nrefund arrives exactly four weeks from when you accept the loan? Assume no compounding during those\nfour weeks.\nSolution:\nA weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use\nof $800. Of course, that totals 2% of the amount advanced. There are 13 four-week periods in a year, so\neven though the interest rate appears to be small, it amounts to 26% when annualized! We assumed no\ncompounding to keep the illustration simple, but we further assume that you are not using this advance\nthroughout the year.

This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate. Rates for floating-rate bonds are typically tied to a benchmark interest rate that exists in the\neconomy. Common benchmark rates include the US Treasury note rate, the Federal Reserve funds rate\n(federal funds rate), the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the prime rate.",

The annual payments continue for 15 years, with the last payment being\nmade on September 19, 2026. At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments\nconstitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.\nThe principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount\nis a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.\nIn Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments. For now, we\nwill jump to the answer and simply use the YTM of 1.24% from the bond data in Table 10.1. Later in the\nchapter, we will develop the concepts behind how an appropriate discount rate is determined.\nFor Step 3, we now apply two equations to the set of future cash flows from the bond. This will then provide us\nwith the present values of these cash flows, or the expected present-day value of the bond. Because we know\nthat the coupon payments constitute an annuity stream, we can use the equation for the present value of an\nannuity (discussed in Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments. To value the one-time par value\npayment, we use the equation for the present value of a lump sum payment. So, by combining these, we will\nhave the present value of the coupon payment stream, or\nSo, for our example above, this becomes\nNext, we need to determine the present value of the payment of the par or face value of the bond at maturity.\nThis is calculated as follows:\nInserting our values into this formula gives us\nAdding the present values of the two payment streams gives us",

This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\ncompared to stocks.\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n291\nWhile yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are\ncurrently low because the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) has kept interest rates low for several years,\ninvestors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.2 This is especially true as investors enter their\nretirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks. Because income from most bonds is fixed, such instruments can have\ntheir values eroded by external factors such as interest rates and inflation.

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to\nissue them to raise capital. In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political\nmovement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets.

However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they",

The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the\ndenominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.\nAnalyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when\na company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry\nthat it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as\nwhether a stock that has a ratio of\nis a good buy at its current price or if a stock with a P/E ratio of\nis\ntoo expensive, without performing any relevant comparisons or further analysis.\nAnalysts have many different ways to interpret P/E ratio data. One of the most common interpretations is that\nfirms with high P/E ratios should be growth companies. Also, a high P/E ratio could mean that a stock’s price is\nhigh relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. This could signal a possible undesired downward\nadjustment in market price in the future.\nWe can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be\nstabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to\nearnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential\ninvestment gains through stock price appreciation.\nWhile this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution\nmust always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,\nwhich would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term.

Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses. The P/CF ratio is helpful for arriving at a less\ndistorted view of such a company’s value.",

The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward.

T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\nexplicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and\ninstitutional investors.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average. For the selected items presented\nhere, only the average price for used cars and trucks rose at a rate significantly lower than the average rate of\ninflation.\nYear\n1980 2000 2020 Annual Change\nCollege tuition and fees\n70.8 331.9 877.3\n6.49%\nRent\n80.9 183.9 341.5\n3.67%\nUsed cars and trucks\n62.3 155.8 144.2\n2.12%\nGround beef\n104.6 125.2 296.2\n2.64%\nButter\n89.4 135.9 248.7\n2.59%\nCPI (1982 to 1984 = 100)\n82.4 172.2 258.8\n2.90%\nTable 12.3 Changing Consumer Price Levels—Selected Goods (source:\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index)\nUsing Graphs and Charts to Plot Inflation Behavior\nThe CPI is a measure of how prices have changed for a basket of goods across the United States.

Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments\nin 1982. That year provided the highest annual return in the 20-year period, with an annual return of 32.81%.\nThe lowest annual return was in 1999, as the Federal Reserve began to raise rates to temper an overheating\nstock market caused by dot-com speculation gaining momentum. When the Fed raised interest rates, the\nprices on existing bonds fell, and investors realized a -8.25% return on their bond portfolios. Thus, the range in\nreturns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in\nthis particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust\n10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.\n366\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.8 Treasury Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nInflation slowed from 2000 to 2020, and the average annual rate of return on T-bonds fell accordingly (see\nFigure 12.9). With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being\nlower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the\nprevious century. The range of returns was also smaller than the previous two decades, with the highest\nannual return topping out at 20.10% in 2008 and the lower end dipping down to -11.12% in 2009 as the Fed\nmade a significant effort to reduce interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy following the Great\nRecession.\nCorporate Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs\nThe performance of Baa bonds is very similar to T-Bonds over the four decades spanning 1980 to 2020 (see\nFigure 12.10).

In over 40 years of investing in bonds and other types of fixed-\nincome securities worldwide, Bill Gross earned his moniker “the bond king.”\nIn 1971, Gross cofounded and began his long tenure as managing director and chief investment officer of\nPacific Investment Management Company, better known as Pimco. Gross was not yet 30 years old, but he\nhad already graduated from college, served in the Navy in Vietnam, and even briefly worked as a\nprofessional blackjack player in Las Vegas to bankroll the cost of his MBA from UCLA.\nGross helped change the definition of success for bond investors by focusing on total returns, including\nprice changes, rather than simply bond yields. He used mathematical modeling and invested worldwide\nand in different types of bond markets seeking risk-adjusted returns. Gross made active rather than passive\nmanagement of bond funds a successful investment strategy.

During the financial crisis of 2008, Gross served as an adviser to the US Treasury.\nMorningstar named him “fixed income fund manager of the decade” in 2010. In addition, Gross profited\nfrom his investment prowess, amassing a fortune in excess of $2 billion.\nGross’s investment strategy was to carefully analyze the known factors about debt instruments and pair\nthat analysis with the unknown future. He was uncanny in his ability to estimate future prices, interest\nrates, and macroeconomic conditions to make profitable investments.\nHowever, as efficient markets would posit, the odds began to catch up with Gross in the latter part of his\ninvesting career. After leaving Pimco in 2014, Gross was unable to match his earlier performance successes\nand failed to beat bond fund performance averages. Much of Gross’s investment strategy allowed him to\nlook for bond returns by investing in any type of bond, with any maturity, in any country, and in any\nlocation. For decades, he was right more often than wrong in his investment choices. However, statistically,\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\n369\nhis approach to investing suggested that, unless he could see the future, at some point his expectations\nwould be incorrect. Perhaps Gross’s greatest competition comes from a generation of investment\nmanagers who learned and improved upon his proven strategies. He retired as an active public fund\nmanager in 2019.\nToday, Gross continues to manage his personal fortune, as well as the assets in his family charitable\nfoundation. Gross and the foundation have donated over $800 million to several causes over the last two\ndecades. In 2020, Gross joined Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and hundreds of other billionaires in signing the\nGiving Pledge, whose signees promise to donate over 50% of their wealth during their lifetime and/or upon\ntheir death.\n(Sources: Mary Childs. “Bill Gross Made the Bond Market What It Is Today.” Barron’s.

Both indices\ntrack the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies.

When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\nseveral types of graphs, such as bar graphs, time series graphs, and so on.\nThe most effective type of graph to use for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the data and the\npurpose of the graph. For example, a time series graph is typically used to show how a measurement is\nchanging over time and to identify patterns or trends over time.\nBelow are some examples of typical applications for various graphs and displays.\nGraphs used to show the distribution of data:\n•\nBar chart: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for categorical data\n•\nHistogram: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for continuous data\nGraphs used to show relationships between data points:\n•\nTime series graph: used to show measurement data plotted against time, where time is displayed on the\nhorizontal axis\n•\nScatter plot: used to show the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable\nBar Graphs\nA bar graph consists of bars that are separated from each other and compare percentages.

One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,\nQ3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles\ndivide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.\n13.4 Statistical Distributions\nA frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to\norganize and tabulate the data in a summarized way.

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year.

In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%.

In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return.

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically. There are\nalso events that broadly impact the stock market. Changes in the Federal Reserve Bank’s monetary policy and\n3\nAbigail Stevenson. “Jim Cramer Shares His #1 Rule for Investing.” Make It.

Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio.

In these cases, the payback period will not be an integer but\n480\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nwill contain a fraction of a year. This video demonstrates how to calculate the payback period\n(https://openstax.org/r/how-to-calculate) in such a situation.\nAdvantages\nThe principal advantage of the payback period method is its simplicity. It can be calculated quickly and easily.\nIt is easy for managers who have little finance training to understand. The payback measure provides\ninformation about how long funds will be tied up in a project. The shorter the payback period of a project, the\ngreater the project’s liquidity.\nDisadvantages\nAlthough it is simple to calculate, the payback period method has several shortcomings. First, the payback\nperiod calculation ignores the time value of money. Suppose that in addition to the embroidery machine,\nSam’s is considering several other projects. The cash flows from these projects are shown in Table 16.2. Both\nProject B and Project C have a payback period of five years. For both of these projects, Sam’s estimates that it\nwill take five years for cash inflows to add up to $16,000. The payback period method does not differentiate\nbetween these two projects.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nProject A ($) (16,000) 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000\nProject B ($) (16,000) 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 6,000\n-",

The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\nestimate of what it expects.\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\nby the end of April.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReducing Capital Spending\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The cost of common stock capital cannot be directly observed in the market; it must be estimated. Two\nprimary methods for estimating the cost of common stock capital are the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)\nand the constant dividend growth model.\nCAPM\nThe CAPM is based on using the firm’s systematic risk to estimate the expected returns that shareholders\nrequire to invest in the stock. According to the CAPM, the cost of equity (re) can be estimated using the\nformula\nFor example, suppose that Bluebonnet Industries has an equity beta of 1.3. Because the beta is greater than\n17.2 • The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\n511\none, the stock has more systematic risk than the average stock in the market.

This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.",

Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases. Once the company’s debt\nexceeds its guaranteed cash flow, which is $18,000 in our example, debt holders face some risk that the",

This is because the past isn’t always a perfect indicator of the future, and our finances don’t\nalways follow a linear pattern. We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we\nknow to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.\nMany items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,\ngather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the\npotential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an\nexhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.\n•\nIt has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in\nmonthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.\n•\nIt will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to\nbegin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s\nmonthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,\nand August.\n•\nThe company has just finished updating its employee compensation package.

In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a long operating cycle because of the\nproduction process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current\nratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much\nlower current ratios.\nIn recent years, Walmart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has had a current ratio of around 0.9 and has been able to\nmanage its working capital needs by efficient management of its supply chain, quick turnover of inventory,\nand a very small investment in accounts receivables.1 Big retailers like Walmart are effective at negotiating\nfavorable payment terms with their vendors.

Using accounts payable to purchase goods and services can involve an\nopportunity cost—a cost of the forgone opportunity of making a quick payment and benefiting from a cash\ndiscount. A business that does not take advantage of a cash discount for early payment of trade credit will pay\nmore for goods and services than a business that routinely takes advantage of discounts.\nThe annual percentage rate of forgoing quick payment discounts can be estimated with the following formula:\nExample: Novelty Accessories Inc. (NAI) purchases products from a vendor that offers credit payment terms of\n2/10, net 30. The annual cost to NAI of not taking advantage of the discount for quick payment is 36.73\npercent.\n19.3\nCash Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why firms hold cash.\n•\nList instruments available to a financial manager for investing cash balances.\nCash management means efficiently collecting cash from customers and managing cash outflows. To manage\ncash, the cash budget—a forward-looking document—is an important planning tool. To understand cash\nmanagement, you must first understand what is meant by cash holdings and the motivations (reasons) for\nholding cash. A cash budget example is covered in Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan.\nCash Holdings\nThe cash holdings of a company are more than the currency and coins in the cash registers or the treasury\nvault. Cash includes currency and coins, but usually those amounts are insignificant compared to the cash\nholdings of checks to be deposited in the company’s bank account and the balances in the company’s\nchecking accounts.\nMotivations for Holding Cash\nThe initial answer to the question of why companies hold cash is pretty obvious: because cash is how we pay\nthe bills—it is the medium of exchange. The transactional motive of holding cash means that checks and\nelectronic funds transfers are necessary to meet the payroll (pay the employees), pay the vendors, satisfy\ncreditors (principal and interest payments on loans), and reward stockholders with dividend payments. Cash\nfor transaction is one reason to hold cash, but there is another reason—one that stems from uncertainty and\nthe precautions you might take to be ready for the unexpected.\nJust as you keep cash balances in your checking and savings accounts and even a few dollars in your wallet or\npurse for unexpected expenditures, cash balances are also necessary for a business to provide for unexpected",

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments.

The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500\n($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.\n19.4 • Receivables Management\n581",

One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk. In 2020, corporations experienced an unprecedented risk\nbecause of COVID-19. Coffee shops were forced to remain closed as communities experienced government-\n3\nStarbucks.

If Starbucks agrees to pay a Brazilian coffee grower seven million\nBrazilian reals for an order of one million pounds of coffee beans, Starbucks will need to purchase Brazilian\nreals to pay the bill.

Although Starbucks would have locked in a price of BRL 7,000,000 for one million pounds of coffee\nbeans, it would not have known what the coffee beans would cost the company in terms of US dollars.\nIf the US dollar appreciated so that it cost less to purchase each Brazilian real in July, Starbucks would find that\nit was paying less than $1,287,300 for the coffee beans.

Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the\nexpenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.\nThe Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in\nFigure 20.3. In 2012, $1.00 could be purchased with fewer than 80 Japanese yen. In 2015, it took over 120 yen to\npurchase $1.00.\nFigure 20.3 Japanese Yen to One US Dollar8\nIf a company is receiving yen from customers and paying expenses in dollars, the company is harmed when\nthe yen depreciates relative to the dollar, meaning that the yen the company receives from its customers can\nbe exchanged for fewer dollars. Conversely, when the yen appreciates, it takes fewer yen to purchase each\ndollar; this appreciation of the yen benefits companies with revenues in yen and expenses in dollars.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nProjecting Sales in US Dollars\nThe managers of a firm think that the exchange rate of Japanese yen to US dollars will be\nnext year.

Starbucks might purchase a coffee plantation in Costa Rica for 120\nmillion Costa Rican colones. This land is an asset for Starbucks, and as such, the value of it should appear on\nthe company’s balance sheet.\nThe balance sheet for Starbucks is created using US dollar values. Thus, the value of the coffee plantation has\nto be translated to dollars. Because exchange rates are volatile, the dollar value of the asset will vary\ndepending on the day on which the translation takes place. If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,\nthen this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance.

If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically.

If the spot rate is\n, the option writer will be obligated\nto sell the dollars for KWN 50 less than what they are worth; because the option writer was initially paid a KWN\n50 premium for taking on that obligation, the option writer will just break even. For any exchange rate higher\nthan\n, the writer of the call option will have a loss.\nThe option contract is a zero-sum game. Any payoff the owner of the option receives is exactly equal to the\nloss the writer of the option has. Any loss the owner of the option has is exactly equal to the payoff the writer\nof the option receives.\nPut Options\nWhile the call option you just considered gives the owner the right to buy an underlying asset, the put option\ngives the owner to right to sell an underlying asset. Take, for example, an Indian company that has a contract\nto provide graphic artwork for a US company. The US company will pay the Indian company 200,000 US dollars\nin three months.\nWhile the Indian company receives US dollars, it must pay its workers in Indian rupees. Because the company\ndoes not know what the spot exchange rate will be in three months, it faces transaction risk and may be\ninterested in hedging this exposure using a put option.\nThe company knows that the current spot rate is\n, meaning that the company would be able\nto use $200,000 to purchase\nif it possessed the $200,000 today. If\nthe Indian rupee appreciates relative to the US dollar over the next three months, however, the company will\nreceive fewer rupees when it makes the exchange; perhaps the company will not be able to purchase enough\nrupees to cover the wages of its employees.\nAssume the company can purchase a put option that gives it the right to sell US dollars in three months at a\nstrike price of INR 75/USD; the premium for this put option is INR 5. By purchasing this put option, the\ncompany is spending INR 5 to guarantee that it can sell its US dollars for rupees in three months at a price of\nINR 75/USD.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n611\nIf, in three months, when the company receives payment in US dollars, the spot exchange rate is higher than\n, the company will simply exchange the US dollars for rupees at that exchange rate, allowing",

The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has\nor its sales\nEuropean option\nan option that the holder can exercise only on the expiration date\nexchange rate\nthe price of one currency in terms of another currency\nexercise price (strike price)\nthe price the option holder pays for the underlying asset when exercising an\noption",
